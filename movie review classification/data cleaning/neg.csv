 I have to congratulate the genius who approved this one. Edward Furlong you're not as good as you think mate you can't grab on every piece of low-cost amateur crap which sole intention has to be to get some bucks. The filming is bad and I mean BAD. Anyone with a camera would get the same result or better. The acting lets just say: don't go to the supermarket looking for actors. The good ones usually come with a degree or at least have some damn experience! The director.. Mr. Jon Keeyes please find your purpose in life as a director you simply suck. Your directing is poor the angles are all messed up (not in a good way) the lines seem as if they're being read out of toilet paper and the damn music.. it always comes up when it shouldn't and goes out for no apparent reason. And don't go for writer either by the way. Making movies isn't like serving on a coffeshop it requires art and skill things I really doubt you'll ever have. Instead of making a badass shootout movie you should've shot this one back to oblivion and wait 'till something good came up.. Or just go find a job on a coffeshop. You'll have less stress and you'll save movie goers some money and a bad night. vote: 1/10 (my first one) 
 I watched this movie really late last night and usually if it's late then I'm pretty forgiving of movies. Although I tried I just could not stand this movie at all it kept getting worse and worse as the movie went on. Although I know it's suppose to be a comedy but I didn't find it very funny. It was also an especially unrealistic and jaded portrayal of rural life. In case this is what any of you think country life is like it's definitely not. I do have to agree that some of the guy cast members were cute but the french guy was really fake. I do have to agree that it tried to have a good lesson in the story but overall my recommendation is that no one over 8 watch it it's just too annoying. 
 The trailers get you to the movie but the movie just wasn't worth my 8.50.. it has some good effects but the storyline.. yech i like tommy lee jones and will smith as actors they have both done some good films but i wish they hadn't added this one to their resume's. To be honest the book is better.. 
 I wasted my time and gave this show a chance. This has to be one of the worst new shows. If they gave an award to shows that suck THIS one should sweep the category. The acting is poor and the story line is contrived. Now Dinosaurs was a bit strange but at least it was entertaining. That show lasted three seasons and was finally scraped. This new show based on an insurance companies commercials is not funny and really has nothing going for it. Possibly the original commercials and the amount of times they were and still are repeated is what is wrong with this show. It just came to TV and already we are tired of seeing the caveman characters. 
 Plot Synopsis: When his wife a news reporter is kidnapped & replaced with an android double Secret Service agent Eric Phillips tracks her down & uncovers a plan by an arms dealer to create an army of invincible androids to assassinate world leaders. I wasn't expecting much when I first saw this sequel to Richard Pepin's low-budget sci-fi / action hybrid Cyber Tracker . That film was nothing special not to mention a blatant rip-off of both The Terminator & RoboCop . This sequel is the same as before with an all-out action sequence opening the film. There are plenty of explosions heavy gunfire & a huge bodycount as well as some martial-arts moves courtesy of the film's star Don The Dragon Wilson. The whole film seems like a series of action scenes strung together with minimal plot. On the acting front Wilson is a bad actor. He really needs a personality transplant. 
 I have been searching for the right words to describe this film. At first I was inclined to simply skip to more significant matters as the film does not rise to a level deserving comment. Yet I stopped puzzled as to how to describe such stuff and somewhat intrigued by the challenge presented by the question: What can one say about such a film? Rubbish? No its not rubbish rubbish can be recycled into something useful. Greenhouse gas? No its not greenhouse gas greenhouse gases help plants grow large and healthy. Finally I struck on Not even bad a rework of the phrase Not even wrong used sometimes in theoretical physics to describe a theory that is hopelessly flawed and not even worthy of correction. That's it then Georgia Rule: Not even bad. 
 This is one of the most boring horror films I have ever seen as it's absolutely god awful John Carradine has very limited screen time. All the characters are boring and the story is terrible plus I could see the two twists at the end coming miles away!. The great setting and the creepy house definitely would have helped if it wasn't so damn boring and there isn't one character to root for either plus I hope it makes it's way to the bottom 100 because it deserves to be there in my opinion. When John Carradine finally shows up at the end it's a pretty good scene but it's already way too late and the only other screen time he had was in flashbacks plus the only really gory scene in the movie is when a character gets his face messed up by Bee's as it was rather gory. I got this in a DVD Horror set called Back From The Grave and everyone really overacts in my opinion plus it's lucky this was included in a set I bought otherwise I would have chucked this out the window!. This is one of the most boring Horror films I have ever seen as It's absolutely god awful John Carradine has very limited screen time and I say avoid it like the plague! you don't want to go through the torture. The Direction is absolutely terrible!. Carl Monson does an absolutely terrible! job here making every thing look cheap wasting his potential on making creepy atmosphere and just keeping the film at an incredibly dull pace. The Acting is just as bad. John Carradine is good in his scene but other then that he's hardly in the film other then flashback scenes. (Carradine Ruled!!). Merry Anders overacts here terribly as Laura as she didn't convince me at all. Ivy Bethune is OK and somewhat creepy but also overacted she did have a creepy smile at the end though. Rest of the cast I didn't pay enough attention too as I had a lot of trouble getting through it but they were all really bad. Overall please avoid this It's not worth the agony!. BOMB out of 5 
 Holy crap this movie was bad. I watched it just as a joke. It isn't even so bad that it's good in an unintentional way. This film seemed to be designed to personally make me angry. It worked really well at doing that. It's as if the people who made this just took all of the really annoying stuff about the movie PRIEST added in a bunch of ugly dudes took out anything interesting funny or even remotely sexy and clever out of the concoction and then added in a bunch of old rotten cheese. That's all this is. Cheese. There isn't a single person this film could possibly connect to. There isn't any universe this film could possibly take place in. Why can't a film like this just be about enjoying life and being happy? Why did they have to make this already stupid idea for a film even more ridiculous than it already is? Why couldn't they at least even tried to make it an okay film or even a B-movie. Now that I think of it what they hell were they trying to do with this film? I watched it expecting a campy love story and instead I got some boring student project about some idiot who has to find the strength and courage to marry his boyfriend while his annoying Christian brother tried to destroy it all!!! No I'm not joking. That's what it's about. Does that sound good? This film is pretty ignorant against people of the Christan religion with it's stereotyping of all Christians being loudmouthed rude and hellbent on making as many people as miserable as possible. A lot of Christian people I know would never speak or act like these freaks. The film however is just as unfair and ignorant to the gay community as well. These have got to be the most tastelessly crafted stereotypical gay men since the guy on the radio station on that ROADKILL video game. It's so nerve wracking and simply irritating to the point that I wasn't able to fully pay attention to this film. The makers of this train-wreck had no strategy for set design acting camera angles lighting script authenticity or an idea to make this entertaining or interesting. There isn't even a single sex scene or at least not a believable one. Jamie Brett Gabel was the only guy in the film that looked any good at all but his good looks were sadly put to waste. This is trash. In a perfect world this film would get voted a 0.0. It's worth 0 as a film alone. A mentally handicapped nun who is blind deaf and has tiny little bones for arms and legs and whose face is located on her armpit could write direct and produce a better film and she'd probably be a better actor as well. the fact that this film exists is a crime against the word film itself. This film is so bad that other films should be ashamed of being available in the same watchable format. I could put a broom in a chair and then record it with a camera and then stop the film and then replace it with a mini x-mas tree and then record that and I've already made a film that will always be better than BEN & ARTHUR by at least half. There are only two things worse than death. Torture and watching BEN & ARTHUR. I'm a homosexual and I will probably be the gayest person you will ever meet if you ever met me and I don't think I've ever been more offended by an entire film than I was by the first five seconds of this film alone. If this movie was a mistake I will personally find a way to change the famous phrase It's okay to make mistakes to It's okay to make mistakes unless that mistake was BEN & ARTHUR. You know how people always say things like Good things come out of everything! ? I think that BEN & ARTHUR was primarily invented so that there could be something on this earth that nothing good would ever come out of. To call this movie the worst movie I've ever seen would be giving it WAY too much credit. It's as if this film were designed just so that it could qualify in a category of it's very own. There are good movies there are bad movies and then there's BEN & ARTHUR. This is BEN AND ARTHUR. 
 I see what the director was trying to do but he missed the mark. The main actor was really good but the editing around his moments takes you out of it. The camera work ie lighting and exposer is kind of amateur which I could forgive if the direction was more fluent but it wasn't. The sound was a bit off and that takes you out of the film as well. I see could see this director doing a little bit better in the future so not a total right off but don't expect a dv movie nearly as good as 28 days later or anything keep your expectations low and you'll get more out of it. At least it was only an hour and a half. Oh yeah and other than the lead the acting was pretty bad if you ask me. But I'm a movie snob so take that for what that's worth. 
 I was very surprised how bad this movie was. Nice cinematography and beautiful landscapes can only take the movie so far. I was hoping for a rerun of Hero but this is much much worse. This movie is why kung fu movies got a bad reputation in the first place. No believable characters (even within the cartoonish world of kung fu movies these characters are ridiculous) virtually no plot and ridiculous story twists. This movie is so boring and so frustrating because it reminds you of trying to play a make believe game with a child. Every time you think your silly battle makes some sense they invent another ridiculous twist that makes no sense ( Ah ha you only think you've got me with your super powers and 10 000 ray guns but I ate my vitamins laced with plutonium and teflon so your ray guns don't work and I'm invulnerable to your super powers....tap tap no trade backs infinity PLUS one. ) Children can continue with this lunacy because they don't really care whether anyone is listening because they are having a fun time. However for the VIEWER especially the adult viewer this long movie is worse than a bout with bad gas. SPOILERS AHEAD Note to kung fu movie makers (a) if you have a knife in your back it hurts unless you are on PCP in which case your kung fu is not strong (b) if you repeatedly fall on your back which has a knife in it it will hurt more and do more damage unless it is a fake prop (c) when you get stabbed in the heart with a knife you die especially in ancient china where there isn't a Kaiser Permanente around the corner (d) kung fu fights don't last for hours while 3 feet of snow falls and (e) sometimes it is worth while explaining your characters and their motivations. In any event go watch Hero again because at least within its own little world it is comprehensible. 
 Steve Carpenter cannot make horror movies. First of all the casting was very wrong for this movie. The only decent part was the hot brown haired girl from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. This movies has no gore(usually a key ingredient to a horror movie) no action no acting and no suspense(also a key ingredient). Wes Bentley is a good actor but he is so dry and plain in this that it's sad. There were a few parts that were supposed to be funny(continuing the teen horror/comedy movies) and no one laughed in the audience. I thought that this movie was rated R and I didn't pay attention and realized it had been changed to PG-13. Anyway see this movie if you liked I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. That's the only type of person who would find this movie even remotely scary. And seriously this is to you Steve Carpenter stop making horror movies. This movie makes Scream look like Texas Chainsaw Massacre. 
 All the other comments already said what I was going to say here goes anyway. I thought this was Italian at first sorry about that Italy. I wasn't bored because I kept waiting for something to happen. Who did that song about Dr. Tarr and Professor Feather way back when? Was it Alan Parsons? Saw this on a Brentwood 10 pack and the quality was as expected terrible. Full of streaks and stuff. The movie was an incoherent mess. Goofy music and clueless characters. The main guy should have known in the first minute that the doctor was nuttier than the patients. I thought the doctor directing the battle scene was never going to end. Had some good looking babes though. It seems these dumb ass movies always throw in a naked chick or two and that gets you hooked. I gave it a 2 for the nekkid women. That bird people dance made me want to pull out my own eyeballs. Poe probably did about 3 000 rpms in his grave when this thing came out because it was loosely based on a story of his. 
 I have never read the Bradbury novel that this movie is based on but from what I've gathered it will be interesting (when I finally do read it and I will). My comments will be based purely on the film. As soon as I saw the trailer I knew I had to see it and was so excited but when I finally did I was so disappointed it hurt. This is because the movie itself felt so amateurish. The actors were not well cast (though Robards and Pryce are both good actors - just not here). The kid actors it seemed were merely asked to show up get in the characters' clothes say the lines and make the faces. The set and props were cheap and unrealistic. The direction was surprisingly bad. I was so surprised at the awfulness of it that I had to go online and check who directed it just to see the kind of work he had done. The editing was cut and paste and the plot (screenplay) was just that as well (even though the author had been involved himself irony?). The building up of the tension fear and suspense was so mild it was ineffective when the climax finally came. I've read some of the comments on this movie and find it hard to believe people actually like it. What hurts the most is that the content is interesting and fun and intriguing. It had so much potential. Unfortunately the film was so technically bad it takes away from the brilliance of the story. 
 This has to be one of the 5 worst movies ever made. The plot looked intriguing like that of Passenger 57. But with the latter movie it somehow worked a lot better. The plot has been worked out in the worst possible way. Just a few of the awful moments in the movie A flight attendant is standing in the opened doorway of a flying 747 and trying to close the door without being sucked out by the 250 mile per hour winds?!? Thereafter the lands the aircraft from a few miles out starting at 8000 feet thats impossible even for 747 pilots with thousands of hour experience. When on the runway (perfectly straight of course) she is instructed to pull on the flaps HUH!! Come on flaps are there to ensure lift at low speeds when on the runway you use thrust reverse on the engines and give maximum power! I can go on and on about little and mostly big mistakes in the movie but then my reply would become the size of the English dictionary. This is a movie you want to miss take my word for it! 
 The makers of this film have created a future where not only is abortion and birth control illegal in every state but women are prosecuted for murder and sent away to serve long prison sentences.In other words this film is every liberals worst nightmare!The political agenda is so heavy-handed here and the style of the film is so low-key that it just loses steam pretty quickly.Regardless of which side of the fence you're on I'd recommend skipping it. 
 I saw the 10p.m. showing and I must say that this movie was nothing special. Although I did not leave the theater wanting my time back (as I don't actually pay for movies anymore) I didn't really find any redeeming qualities. There were a few lines and such that made me chuckle but mostly the film seemed to consist of rampant fan service to the younger (in mind more than age as this film is rated R) male audience. The fan service seemed out of place and rather distracting as well. I know you all want to hear Samuel L. say his infamous line but let's be honest it's a whole lot of hype for very little pay off. The only truly horrible part of the film was the CG which looked very digitized and did not mesh well with the live action on the screen. Now I am a reasonable man I knew going into the theater that I wasn't going to be seeing Casablanka and I am at least thankful that this film is an original (albiet inane) idea and not some re-make or franchise spin off. However to be honest if you are not a part of the cult following you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere and seeing the film either in a second run theater in a few weeks or renting it in a few months. 
 One of if not the worst film to come out of Britain in the 80s. This tawdry tale of a middle aged lecher who 'seduces' two teenage scrubbers who babysit for him and his faux-posh wife has nothing to redeem it. In turns gratuitous puerile uncouth and unrealistic this film plumbs the depths as it fails miserably in its attempts to be funny provocative intellectual and controversial. Perhaps the worst thing about this film is the way the strong cast of George Costigan Michelle Holmes and Siobhan Finneran are completely stitched by such a lame script. It's no surprise that this was the late Andrea Dunbar's only work to make it onto the screen. Complete and utter rubbish on every level. 
 The movie was OK . Not bad not good just OK. If there was anything else in the theater this would be skipped by far. Sadly Fast and Furious 2 also stunk but I'd rather see this than FF2. :) If you have a fetish for harrison ford or that other young punk this will be a cute movie for you. Personally I'd wait for HBO or Blockbuster. 
 What a fantastic premise: A movie about the Berlin Airlift. It should have it all. Tragedy. Suspense. Comradeship. Rivals. Berliner Frauleins and tough US pilots. love and Tears. What we've got is a film with none of the above. Heino Ferch tries to impersonate John Wayne or so but he fails miserably. He acts so wooden that at any given moment he should crack. He tries to play the tough guy instead of being a tough guy! Why would Bettina Zimmermann's character fall in love with him? Cause they were throwing stones in a lake? Cause he brings her coal bricks? The SFX are very very well done. Too much though. The hundreds or so planes over Berlin look like an attack-fighter-formation-squadron rather than an organised airlift ? as it actually was. Interestingly enough the White House the Kremlin and General Lucius D. Clays office seem all to be one and the same dark and dusty set. Notice the same drapes hanging deep down the windows as if a protective shield against nuclear fallout. Why is almost every scene INSIDE dark and dusty? By the way GENERAL LUCIUS D. CLAY comes across as a small time insecure looser General who doest trust in his own noble idea the airlift. He was very much the opposite. So you combine all those individual blunders and the result is a film with that builds toward no passion no suspense and no historic accuracy. Sad it started out so promising? 
 The fact that there are positive comments about Dan in Real Life on the IMDb just makes me realize that their junket staff are hard at work trying to get people to watch this utterly horrific film. I have no words no idea where to start to describe the truly awful film I sat through last night - Dan in Real Life. Steve's characters in previous films led me to believe that I would feel something for his character and enjoy the dialog but like other posters I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed for the cast. The dialog was so contrived the family was this cookie cutter Walton's family and the film has been so many times before that I am shocked someone thought it was an original idea. Do yourself a favor and take a pass on this terrifyingly bad movie and don't believe everything you read on the IMDb since the first comments were clearly written by folks sitting in a different theater watching a GOOD film. 
 I really must watch a good movie soon because it seems every other entry or so is something that I despise. However my history speaks I must not tell a lie. Bobby Deerfield and everything about it sucks big green banana peels. I never thought that I would see a film thud as thunderously as this one did. Al Pacino isn't acting in this film: he's posing. There are many many scenes of his character who is a race car driver just staring at the camera. He's perfectly awful. Marthe Keller is just as bad. These two are supposed to be in a love affair and there is simply no chemistry whatsoever. Sydney Pollack directed this film? There's no trace of the genius behind Tootsie here. Is this the same man I cheered for in Eyes Wide Shut? I can hardly believe it. Save yourself a horrible movie experience. Run don't walk away from Bobby Deerfield. 
 I had a feeling that after Submerged this one wouldn't be any better... I was right. He must be looking for champagne money and not care about the final product... his voice gets repeatedly dubbed over by a stranger that sounds nothing like him; the editing is - well - just a grade above amateurish. It's nothing more than a B or C-grade movie with just enough money to hire a couple talented cameramen and an OK sound designer. Like the previous poster said the problems seem to appear in post-production (...voice dubbing etc.) Too bad cause the plot's actually OK for a SG flick. I'll never rent another SG flick unless he emails me asking for forgiveness. Too bad - I miss Kelly LeBrock... --jimbo 
 This movie does have some great noirish/neorealist visuals and it tells a story that is refreshingly free of Hollywood's sugar-coating which was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film. But some of the scenes go on for much too long (the wedding especially) and I found the exaggerated acting and unrealistic dialog to be more fit for the stage than for the silver screen. The dialog was particularly distracting and it seemed to get worse as the movie went on. Most of the characters were either Italian-Americans or Italian immigrants living in New York in the twenties and thirties but their dialog sounded like they were practicing lines for a Shakespeare play while they mixed cement and laid bricks. Toward the end I was laughing and not because the filmmakers wanted me to. I guess the stilted poetry could be defended by saying that the characters would have been speaking Italian and the dialog is a literal translation of how they would really talk. But it absolutely did not work for me. Another line of dialog made me laugh for a different reason: the main character's son born and raised in New York in the 1920's suddenly picks up a lovely lilting British accent. I'm only guessing this had something to do with the fact that the movie was made in England. I give this movie an 'A' for effort and intention but a considerably lower grade for execution. 
 This was a nice attempt at something but it is too pretentious and boring to rise above it's low budget trappings. The use of virtual sets almost works but at some points it fails miserably. They made good use of the small budget I guess. I just wish the story and most of the acting was better. There are a lot of parts where you see what they were aiming for and it would of been great if they actually hit those marks but they don't. Confusing and unbelievable story. Bad DVD transfer too. It doesn't take much for me to watch a movie in one sitting. This I had to shut off. It was too boring. I can do slow movies. But just make them appealing in some aspect. Visually story-wise acting etc. This was lacking in all departments so it never added up to an engrossing experience. Maybe the film maker's next attempt will be better. 
 It's hard to tell if Noonan and Marshall are trying to ape Abbott & Costello Martin & Lewis Curley & Larry or some other comedy team but whoever it was they were trying to imitate they failed miserably. There's barely one weak laugh in this whole incredibly stupid picture. Noonan (who helped write the alleged script ) and Marshall have no chemistry whatsoever; Marshall seems to be trying for a Dean Martin type of devil-may-care coolness but he doesn't come even remotely close. God knows what Noonan thought he was doing but being funny sure wasn't it. He seems to think that flapping his arms and legs a lot and staring dumbly at everyone and everything is the height of screen comedy; maybe for him it is but not for the audience. I remember seeing this in the theaters when it came out. It was on the bottom of a double bill with a three-year-old Jeff Chandler western ( Pillars of the Sky which was pretty good) and a Three Stooges short ( Sappy Bullfighters which wasn't) and about 20 minutes into this thing all the kids in the audience were throwing stuff at the screen; it was so staggeringly unfunny that it didn't even measure up to the worst of the Three Stooges shorts. I stayed around for the end of it (not that I wanted to but my folks weren't due to pick me up until after the movie ended) and by the time this mess was over I was the only one in the theater. I saw it again about 15 or so years ago on cable one night and stuck around to watch it to see if it was as bad as I remembered. It was worse. The only thing it had going for it was Julie Newmar who was as smokingly hot as ever; other than her this thing has absolutely NOTHING to recommend it. The two of them also play Japanese soldiers and the way they do it makes Jerry Lewis' infamous playing of Japanese characters as thick-lensed buck-toothed gibbering mental defectives look benign by comparison. Marshall went on to host Hollywood Squares and Noonan kept trying his hand at making movies but most of them were almost as bad as this. Not quite though as I don't think ANYTHING could be quite as bad as this. A truly pathetic waste of film. Don't waste your time on it. 
 As other reviewers have noted the film dies in the last 1/2 hour. However before that it suffers from predictability and a stunningly vapid performance by Kate Capshaw who clearly never found her character and ruins every scene she's in. Connery is fine as is Fishbourne but most scenes are manipulated for effect rather than truth which overlays the entirety with a sense of unreality. And the ending is simply bizarre. The film makers apparently knew when they pieced this mess together that all they needed were sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie to have Thanksgiving dinner so to compensate they added an overloud dramatic score. Every little jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration to the point where it becomes laughable. If you want an example of major league bad film this is one to see otherwise skip it. 
 I don't know about you but what I love about Tom and Jerry cartoons is the (often violent) interaction between the two characters. Mouse In Manhattan sees Jerry leaving Tom behind to have an adventure in New York and as far as I am concerned this one definitely suffers from a lack of cat! As magical as Jerry's exploration of the 'Big Apple' might be for the other T&J fans who have commented here on IMDb I couldn't wait for this self-indulgent rubbish to end so I could watch the next cartoon on my DVD. In fact the only part of the whole episode that I genuinely enjoyed was when Jerry almost 'buys the farm' hanging precariously off the end of a broken candle hundreds of feet above a busy road. 
 After being hugely entertained by Mr. Brosnan's performance as a cad in The Tailor of Panama (which I rate 10/10 across the board: casting acting script story editing pace music emotional impact etc.) I enthusiastically anticipated this film. I was hugely disappointed. It is a script reading not a film vulgar for the sake of being vulgar bankrupt in every way that The Tailor of Panama is rich and satisfying. Blame it on the screen writing and directing. I sat in the theater waiting for the good part; it never came. I neither laughed nor cried although one line of dialog did make me smile. Worth $7? Hardly. 
 Years ago when I was a poor teenager my best friend and my brother both had a policy that the person picking the movie should pay. And while I would never pay to see some of the crap they took me to I couldn't resist a free trip to the movies! That's how I came to see crap like the second Conan movie and NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN! Now despite this being a wretched movie it is in places entertaining to watch--in a brain dead sort of way. And technically the stunts and camera-work are good so this elevates my rating all the way to a 2! So why is the movie so bad? Well unlike the first Rambo movie this one has virtually no plot Rambo himself only says about 3 words (other than grunts and yells) there is a needless and completely irrelevant and undeveloped romance and the movie is one giant (and stupid) special effect. And what STUPIFYINGLY AWFUL special effects. While 12383499143743701 bullets and rockets are shot at Rambo none have any effect on him and almost every bullet or arrow Rambo shoots hits its mark! And while the bad guys are using AK-47s helicopters and rockets in some scenes all Rambo had is a bow and arrows with what seem like nuclear-powered tips!! The scene where the one bad guy is shooting at him as he slowly and calmly launches one of these exploding arrows is particularly made for dumb viewers! It was wonderfully parodied in UHF starring Weird Al. Plus HOT SHOTS PART DEUX also does a funny parody of the genre--not just this stupid scene. All-in-all a movie so dumb and pointless it's almost like self-parody! 
 They Are Among Us is poor science fiction at best. Mediocre acting bogs down this film. The plot holes are numerous. Aliens that somehow came to earth on a meteor and have been hiding among us for over 100 years but need a plastic surgeon to make them appear human. In their alien form they supposedly have exo-skeletons (which is why they need the plastic surgery) but when you see them they have teeth and fingernails. The heroine's father disappeared after Project Blue Book closed but was supposedly an F-16 pilot. And on and on. If you want to see an alien invasion movie pick Invasion of the Body Snatchers and see how it is done right. 
 I generally don't give worry much about violence in films or a vast amount of philosophy symbolism or psychology. All this is very well with me and the film brings a lot of the above to us. There is beautiful pictures especially of the lake and the nature a good setting of characters a good direction. This film could be voted for as a good film. However it is spoiled for two reasons and both of these reasons in relation make this film simply disgusting. First of all there is violence used against living creatures to make this film. Not movie violence I am talking about REAL violence. This violence alone maybe could be justified if not and thats reason number two; the message of the film was not mere introspection about the directors twisted relation towards women. Not that we all don't have some real twists with women.(respectively men). But the conclusion of the film ruins it all. *spoiler* Our heroine finally dies (by here own hand if I remember correctly I saw this film years ago and it enraged me now the guy is out with a new film witch I am certainly not going to watch)and is now even more clearly depicted as some kind of natural demon nature growing over her in particular her sex.. Of course it is the director who kills the women heroine. Women have to die especially if men are attracted by their sexuality. That seems to be the final conclusion.**end spoiler* Well well all that possibly would be fine with me if the director would have kept his view to himself. But to use big pictures artsy directions cruelty to living creatures just to say men can be frightened of women and men are cruel to women. Thats just not enough. I knew when I saw this film it would achieve good critics for the philosophical eastern and artistic and whatever approach. But to me this film is just totally marred. 
 this movie was horrible. I could barely stay awake through it. I would never see this movie again if I were payed to. The so-called horror scenes in it were increadably predictable and over played. There was really nothing about this movie that would have made it original or worth the $7.50 I payed to see it. Don't go see it don't rent it don't read about it online because any of these things would be a complete waste of your time. Sarah Michelle Geller gave a lackluster performance and really should be ashamed of herself for sullying her good name with this movie. Shame on you Sarah for being associated with this horrible horrible movie. Horrible movie no need to ever see it. 
 Few films have left me with such a feeling of unease and this is not a compliment. Since I saw it in a theater (How it ended there I can only wonder) I was subjected to 90 mn of hateful derivative garbage the main impression being a bit like this other sick-o movie Don't answer the phone - but worse. The nastiness of it all rape and all is shown without any distance (unlike strong stuff like Last house on the left ) and utter contempt for the (perfect ?) victims and everybody involved leaving the viewer to be treated as a sadistic voyeur. At the end I felt like taking a shower. No credits to the director 
 I just got through watching this DVD at home. We love Westerns so my husband rented it. He started apologizing to me half way through. The saddles costumes accents--everything was off. The part that made me so mad is where the guy didn't shoot the collector with his bow and arrow as he was taking the fat guy's soul. His only excuse was he only had 2 arrows left. We watched it all the way through and as someone else said...too many bad things to single out any one reason why it sucked. I mean the fact that the boy happened to snatch the evil stone from the collector on the same month and day it was found what's the point of that? And why were there a grave yard where everyone died on April 25 but the people whose souls were taken by the collector were still up walking around? If you want a movie to make fun of after a few beers this may be your movie. However if you want a real Western you will hate this movie. 
 i should qualify that title now that i think about it. Checkout is not entirely worthless. i've had the opportunity to see it twice and on the second time i did get a great laugh at the movie's expense. so i guess it's worth something for that. and also it's worthwhile for the excruciating pain it caused me on my first viewing. as another reviewer pointed out this film is hackneyed in every sense of the word. not a single original thought went into this movie (which makes the comment below about the originality of the premise entirely baffling to me). the film is nothing but a long line of cliches which are strung together and paraded around as a movie. it is definitely not the next Clerks it is definitely not original and it is absolutely not good clean fun. the film is absolute agony to the uninitiated (after seeing it a first time the second time can be quite funny in an insulting sort of way). as i looked around the theater it was obvious that nearly everyone barring perhaps the elderly were completely bored or pained by this movie. during some of the particularly emotional scenes like where Nick chews out his mother the audience was actually cringing because it was so poorly done. i even heard someone *groan* in the theater something i had heretofore never witnessed. i don't care where you have the chance to see this movie be it at a film festival or in a indie theater or wherever. do yourself a favor skip this movie with a vengeance. unless you're like me and just can't resist the opportunity to see what may truly be the worst movie ever made. 
 This film although not totally bad should have been filmed where the actual events took place. Grand Island Nebraska was devastated by no less than seven tornados on the night of June 3 1980. Grand Island is situated in the nearly treeless flat Platte River Valley in Hall county. The makers of this movie filmed in the tree covered hills of Ontario and moved the whole event to a non-existant town called Blainsworth. The people of Grand Island bravely survived this awful night only to be forgotten because of a poorly made movie. 
 I feel the movie did not portray Smith historically. The goal of this movie was to tell Smith's life in a way that would be comfortable to the LDS Church leaders historical accuracy seems to have been of little concern. The movie was designed to be a faith promoting experience not a balanced view of Smith as a man. I have taken it upon myself to study Smith's life and have read both LDS works and none LDS works. The movie like most LDS projects was beautifully filmed and well acted. However this was not a realistic portrayal of either the beginnings of Mormonism or Smith's relatively short life. A significant period of time was given to reenacting an accident that Smith had when he was seven. While this event was no doubt important in forming his mental outlook it appears that the main reason for including it in the film is to help establish a sympathetic view of Joseph Smith. Another point is in portraying Smith's teen years the film is silent regarding the Smith family's involvement in magical practices during the 1820's. Another problem is while the movie shows Joseph Smith good-naturedly entering into wrestling contests it fails to show how he sometimes lost his temper and became violent. I could go on and on. This movie was not historical in any way and should be considered a fictional movie about a man. I would not recommend seeing this movie for any other purpose other then entertainment. 
 At the end of this episode Holmes asks Watson not to record the case for posterity.For a good reason! The super sleuth left his little grey cells(sorry Agatha)at home for this tale. There is no deductive reasoning no acute analysis of signs at crime scenes. Holmes bumbles along fifty yards behind the plot. The dastardly CAM is finally dealt to by an old frail-in a manner that would have made Charles Bronson's heart swell with pride-six bullets in the breadbasket.In an ensuing chase a pursuer gets hold of one of Watson's shoes.Mercifully the writer didn't decide to tack on the story of Cinderella to lengthen the film.The murderess Holmes and Watson escape scot free. Oh well it is a bit of a change of pace in late Victorian London.A bit of sixgun law:-) 
 No this is nothing about that fairy tale with the pumpkin coach fairy godmother and the glass slippers but if I were to elaborate I would have to spoil it for you which I won't. But don't let curiosity get the better of you as this movie is not fantastic. It's one of those movies that start off promisingly before betraying its audience with cheap scare tactics and an incoherent storyline. And that's real horror. Yoon-hee (To Ji-Won) and Hyun-soo (Shin Se-kyeong) are your ideal mother and daughter. One's a successful plastic surgeon while the other your dutiful obedient and beautiful teenage daughter. Their relationship is like hand in glove so close you'd think of them more as siblings rather than parent-child. But things start to go wrong (don't they always) when Hyun-soo's friends whom Yoon-hee has operated on start to go berserk. Perhaps it's a warning to audiences and for those Koreans ladies who don't bat an eyelid when going under the knife if news reports are to be believed. The only truly scary moments are those scenes in plastic surgery though somehow I thought Kim Ki-duk's Time actually had more gore when featuring and describing what goes on during the surgery itself. It's a tale of two halves the fist being an attempt to shock audiences with standard scare tactics which I admit did get to me now and then. However the second half degenerated the movie into mindless mumbo-jumbo melodramatics and was quite contrived into its forcing its ideas down your throat. Some things begin not to make sense and while attempts are always presented to explain you probably won't buy it not that horror movies are logical to begin with. The leads are all beautiful and there is a distinct lack of male presence besides the negligible cop role. But hey I'm not complaining though the storyline could have been improved tremendously. I'd recommend you to watch this only if you're a fan of mediocre Korean horror on VCD. Watch out for those face off-ish moments! 
 We all know that some of the greatest movies of all time were based on books. While not particularly accurate adaptations these movies were nonetheless excellent films. Some great examples are the Harry Potter series the Lord of the Rings trilogy and to a lesser extent almost every Disney film ever made. However I must regretfully announce that A Wrinkle in Time is not one of those movies. Not only does it fail to meet some of the most basic expectations of Madeleine L'Engle's fan base it manages to defy the standards of scriptwriting acting special effects and ultimately respect for the audience. Mind you I'm not trying to be mean; on the contrary I went into this affair with an open mind. I figured that a made-for-T.V. movie would make up for its lack of razzle-dazzle in its script. After all the Star Wars spin-off Ewoks was decent if a little silly. Come to think of it the original Star Wars was made on a lunch money budget and look where it took George Lucas! However from the first scene onward disappointment started enveloping me as if I'd gotten too close to the Black Thing while tessering. The same way Greedo shooting first became the symbol of the Star Wars Special Edition of 1997 (a disaster of monumental proportions involving a disgruntled director making several hideous changes to a beloved classic) Mrs. Whatsit has officially become my personal symbol for the confusion and stupidity that is A Wrinkle in Time. The reason for this is the fact that she has been mutated beyond belief. Aside from the slightly controversial decision of casting Alfre Woodard (Star Trek: First Contact and Radio) as our favorite star-turned-mentor the filmmakers decided it appropriate to introduce her as a crow. That's right a crow. Moreover the heavenly centaurion form of this greatly beloved character has been hacked at by what looks to be a demented eight-year-old; the majestic half-man half-horse with wings has become a huge human head with a creepy smile mounted awkwardly on the bowlegged body of a horse that happens to be sporting a pair of wings in the middle. Had I been five this would have psychologically traumatized me for life. The worst part is the fact that when it spoke it was shown from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync resulting in a scene that was spent looking at the back of its head and seeing a single unmoving cheek thus rendering the piece of special effects less believable than E.T. Having gotten the most painful part out of the way I must go on to the tear-inducing one: the characters the acting and the story. I personally had always imagined Meg to look somewhat similar to Moaning Myrtle from the Harry Potter films: plain hair glasses and a figure most supermodels would find laughable. She was always a slightly anxious humorously pessimistic math genius who quite simply could not have cared less about the imports and exports of Nicaragua. In the film she is an unpleasant know-it-all for whom I have no sympathy whatsoever. In fact she makes me feel sorry for poor Mr. Jenkins her school principal who continuously has to deal with her. Calvin the kind intelligent kid who everyone thinks is a jock has become?a jock! The irony is horrible. As for the memorable Happy Medium they took the pleasant old woman who liked to look at happy things and replaced her with a being who is above gender and likes to look at funny things such as girls falling off of swings. The only three people I can think of who did a decent job are Charles Wallace Mrs. Whatsit and the Man With Red Eyes (nicknamed the Dude With Red Eyes due to his complete reinvention as a character). The story is a mess. A good comparison to this aspect of the movie is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban which didn't do a good job of retelling the story found in the book yet kept the sole of the original work. Here the sole of the book is having a pleasant chat with Hades down in the underworld apparently unaware that its body is being destroyed. As the Dark Lord complements the sole on how well it showed that truth has to be felt and not seen the flat-nosed wookies of Ixchel (who replace the wondrous beings who hold Aunt Beast among their ranks) tear the spine up. As the God of the Dead notes how subtle the terror of the Earth-like Camazotz was the torn pages are scattered in the sandstorm and lost in the darkness of the land of evil. I am very sorry that this film exists. I do not believe that the actors were genuinely bad. It's the way the characters are written that ruins it. A Wrinkle in Time deserved to be adapted by Lawrence Kasdan directed by George Lucas or Steven Spielberg enhanced at Industrial Light and Magic scored by John Williams given its sound at Skywalker Sound edited by THX and marketed by Twentieth Century Fox. In its current state the film is unworthy to be shown to self-respecting people. Even Madeleine L'Engle thought it was bad. The book was Good the film was Bad and Mrs. Whatsit was Ugly. Score: 0.1/10 (If I could) Pros: They got the names right. Cons: It had horrible problems with the Cliffs Notes level of adaptation script acting and special effects not to mention lack of evidence of ever having read the book. Oh and the main cover/poster has a picture of the three main characters riding a flying horse over a castle. Some might say that this symbolizes high adventure. I say it symbolizes the irresponsibility of the cover artist who didn't even bother to Photoshop Meg's arm on properly. 
 This film is not funny. It is not entertaining. It does not contain one single second of originality or intelligence nor does it lead you to take the slightest interest in the characters or situation. Added to that it's about as juvenile a movie as anything in recent memory. It's as if a group of 14 or 15 year old high school kids who had never actually met or had any type of relationship with a real girl had sat down and wrote a movie based on their incorrect fantasies about what being an adult man would be like. This movie is boring obnoxiously mind-numbing and at times offensive and disgusting. At most it contains one or two moments that make you laugh. Also it seems twice as long as its 85 minute running time. 
 I'm not looking for quality; I'm just trying to get through the 74 famous video nasties that were banned in Britain. This one was initially banned and re-released in 2001 with a whole 10 seconds cut. Some college kids spend their Christmas vacation preparing a dorm for renovation. There are some creepy characters lurking about along with the four kids. Which of them is the slasher? The actual killings are not very gory so this video nastie is not really nasty. There is the requisite flashing of the boobies but it has nothing to do with the college kids. I had a suspect very quickly and I turned out to be right. Maybe I've seen too many of these. The end twist was clever; I have to give the writers credit for that bit of originality. 
 Sorry but aside from Kim Basinger doing a good job acting scared this was one of the worst thrillers I've seen in awhile. Logic is thrown out as 4 young guys terrorize this woman outside a crowded mall then shoot a security guard. Yet no one seems to notice. Then instead of screaming for help or racing back to the mall she drives off and ends up in the middle of the woods with the guys in hot pursuit. I can't even describe how silly it is seeing this woman fleeing from 4 retarded thugs carrying a red toolbox screaming for God to come help her and then having sex with one of them after brutally killing the others. Please trust me this is bad and a bit tasteless as well. 
 I'm beginning to see a pattern in the movies I give a 1 to. They are almost all movies that my wife made me watch. Maybe I should stop having faith in her taste in movies. Anyway this is typical drivel aimed at pre-teen girls but done even more poorly than usual. Once again the writer broke the cardinal rule of any movie. He/she made the main character unlikable. She starts off by being a complete b*tch to her friend at the beginning and then finds out when she becomes 30 that she's basically a sh*tty person (having affairs etc.). Why the F would we feel for this person? OK let's say we can get past that. Jennifer Garner is about as far from attractive as you can get without having some sort of deformity. I don't know if it's her or the writer's fault but her character goes well beyond my threshold for annoyance. Here's a tip for future filmmakers: 13 year olds are NOT entertaining they're annoying. Far and away the most embarrassing moment in the movie came when they danced to Thriller . Holy crap that was painful. It showed her practicing that dance at the beginning. That explains why she knows it but an entire club full of people?!? Argh!!! The Macarena would be more believable! All of a sudden she's completely incompetent and has no clue how to do her job and no one notices? At least Tom Hanks' character on Big had a job that made sense to a child. These body-switching/child becoming adult overnight movies are really getting out of hand and this is by far the worst one yet. 
 I watched this on the tube last night. The actor's involved first caught my attention. The first scenes were attention getters. Some funny some sad. Good character development. I felt that the latter third of the film diverged. If it was not for the early part of the movie I would have stopped watching. I kept watching wanting to how how it tied together. Unfortunately I feel that it never happened. I especially did not like the extend period that several of the character were talking yiddish (?). Was that the other shoe? Would I recommend? No I think not. As other reviewers mention much of the slang is dated (60's jive) but it was not too distracting. The ending totally turned me off. 
 The plot sounded like it had promise. To be honest I did not watch the entire movie. After about an hour into the movie I had to make a decision. Is this movie worth watching until it conclusion? The answer was clearly NO! It was not the fact that the human body could not receive a transplant from a different species without rejecting it. Nor the premise that he was being chased by secret government authorities for an human / wolf transplant. It was because the movie was badly written acting lacked emotion and I did not understand the several dream sequences with the wolves and buffaloes. When he was running to the zoo with a dog pack and leaving them at the front of the zoo gate the saying If you can't run with the big dogs don't leave the porch kept running through my bored mind. Save yourself the time and skip this movie. I can guarantee if you do dare to watch it you will sit there slack jawed as I did wondering why anyone waste money time energy and effort to make this insulting outrage to American cinema. 
 I think Dolph Lundgren had potential at being a big action star a la Schwarzenegger Stallone and even Van Damme to certain degree. He had some big moments in his career but he also made some poor choices and this is definitely one of them although made later in his career. The strange thing about Jill The Ripper (or Jill Rips...or Tied Up) is that I honestly think they seriously thought they were making a provocative and serious thriller? It shows in the way that they describe it on IMDb on the DVD case in the commentaries and this film is not serious. To call it campy would be a huge understatement. The film tries to be complex and intelligent when in fact it's nothing more than shallow confusing and gratuitous. On top of that they put Lundgren who is known for action films in an attempt at a serious role which makes it even more campy because his range as an actor is pretty limited. The entire film revolves around the kinky sex world and yet they attempt at making it a serious thriller? Just the plot and premise immediately make it a B-Movie Porn at very best. Dolph Lundgren plays disgraced former cop and raging alcoholic Matt Sorenson who decides to play Detective when his brother is murdered. I mean put aside the numerous plot holes that has Lundgren getting free roam to investigate crime scenes and witnesses and everything else even though he's not a cop anymore and you still have a pretty strange and rather lack luster performance from Lundgren. Danielle Brett is Lundgren's eventual love interest and his brother's widow. Brett plays her role decently enough considering the script and campy story. The supporting cast is huge and no one particularly stands out in their performances unless it's on the negative side such as the absolutely horrible performance by Victor Pedtrchenko who seems to go by several different names in the film boasts an awful accent and is a really awful villain. I honestly tried to get into the mystery and film and watch closely but there wasn't any reason to because it was all a jumble of ridiculous plot and gratuitous sex games including a downright ridiculously hilarious scene where Lundgren goes under cover and is strung upside down nearly naked. To explain how classy and well done this movie is (sarcasm...sarcasm) the back of the DVD I picked up (it was really cheap) has Lundgren's character listed as Murray Wilson (not the name of his character in the film.) While somehow Lundgren manages to be usually watchable the film falls flat on it's face trying to be serious. Considering director Anthony Hickox is infamous for really B-Movie Horror flicks it only makes sense even though I think he was really trying to be serious. Hard core cult Lundgren fans will have to see it...no one else should...certainly for any sort of mystery or suspense. 3/10 
 I don't often give one star reviews but the computer won't let me do negative numbers. The opening titles tell us we're in deep water already. Although this is a low budget exploitation film there are 17 producers credited. No. No. At the beginning of the story abusive husband Kenneth comes home to his family in an upscale gated community. The house is a pigsty. His wife Della (Kim Basinger) has let the children run amok all day. OK. We're already in deep water. Ms. Basinger was 55 years old when the film came out. Uh are these her children or grandchildren? It's Christmas Eve. Della drives to the mall a lengthy scene that could have been cut. To bludgeon home the idea of eeeeeeevil male aggression rampant in the universe she drives past football players in full uniform playing in pouring rain on Christmas Eve. Sure. For a bonus she sees a vehicle with a slaughtered deer tied to it. We get some actual suspense in the driving scenes though. It's raining and traffic is bad. First we see Della try to drive and smoke at the same time. Then later Della tries to drive and talk on her cell phone at the same time at one point turning completely around to check the cluttered back seat for the charger for the phone. She wanders the mall sees an old friend from college tries to buy stuff but her credit card is declined- gosh maybe her husband is grumpy because he's going broke but that's too complicated for the script to follow. In the parking lot she runs afoul of the most ludicrous gang in the history of films. One White boy (Lukas Hass watching his career go down the toilet) one Black one Asian and one Hispanic. Imagine a company of Up with People gone to the bad and you'll have the idea. Although they have a gun she gives them attitude. A mall cop comes to investigate the ruckus and they shoot him in the head firing more than once. The parking lot is crowded as can be people everywhere and nobody notices. Della escapes in her car and rather than choosing a police station or well lighted safe area she drives to a construction site where she kills all four bad boys one at a time with simply the tools (literally) at hand. MAJOR spoiler ahead. She drives back home. The car poops out so she walks through the pouring rain. Checks on the children goes downstairs and when her husband petulantly asks what she got him at the mall shows him the gun and shoots him at point blank range. The experience with the four punks was supposed to result in personal empowerment for Della. Instead we know that her children will probably spend Christmas in foster care or a group home because the State will collect them while she answers to murder one charges. The four punks can be classified as justifiable homicide in self defense. The husband different story. I'm so glad I saw this on cable. If I'd seen it in a theater (did it get any release?) I'd have been furious. As is I'm just sad seeing talents like Ms. Basinger and Mr. Haas waste themselves on garbage like this. One very good thing though. This was written and directed by Susan Montford. Ms. Montford has not gotten another writing or directing credit since passing this turd. There is justice in the world. 
 I haven't seen Henry Fool but after watching Fay Grim I'm not sure I want to. Maybe Hartley aims to be the anti-thriller director---he sure succeeded with this yawner. Based on the official description---woman discovers that her dead husband's manuscript contains material that could pose a threat to national security---I expected a taut geopolitical drama. Instead I got flimsy structure goofy dialog flabby characterizations a convoluted plot and a tone that shifts so often it suggests that Hartley changed the script according to his mood at any given time. I can hang for a long time with a frustrating hard-to-follow plot (e.g. Duplicity ) because I figure that the loose ends eventually will come together. Even when they don't or they do but they leave lingering questions (e.g. Duplicity ) sharp writing and acting can hold one's interest. But half-way through Fay Grim I reached a deadly realization---I didn't know what was going on and I didn't care. Too bad because I really like Parker Posey reduced here to working with an absurd part that asked her to morph from indifferent estranged wife and indifferent clueless mother to tough shrewd international player capable of psychological mano a mano with terrorists. There's also bad casting. Jeff Goldblum can be very good but he's not capable of overcoming miscasting as a CIA operative. He looks almost as uncomfortable in the role as I was watching him in it. His CIA sidekick is worse; he looks like a refugee from the quarterfinals of American Idol (are there really young CIA agents with big licks of hair rakishly draped over their foreheads?). Then there's the sticky question of the characters' ages. Goldblum was 54 when he made Fay Grim ; Thomas Jay Ryan who plays Henry Fool was 44. Neither was made to look or seem older than their actual ages. Yet a key point in the story is that they served as CIA agents in Nicaragua back in the '70s. Goldblum's character would've been in his 20s then; Henry Fool would've been a teenager. Was Hartley being quirky or lazy? The problems are too numerous to list... 
 I saw the movie as a child when it was released in the theater and it was so bad that it became the makings of a family joke. If the ranking had a zero this movie would get it. The dinosaurs were awful. The storyline was ridiculous. The acting really doesn't qualify to be called acting. The only reason I even remember the name of the movie so well is because my family still talks about how BAD it really was. 
 Oh dear. good cast but to write and direct is an art and to write wit and direct wit is a bit of a task. Even doing good comedy you have to get the timing and moment right. Im not putting it all down there were parts where i laughed loud but that was at very few times. The main focus to me was on the fast free flowing dialogue that made some people in the film annoying. It may sound great while reading the script in your head but getting that out and to the camera is a different task. And the hand held camera work does give energy to few parts of the film. Overall direction was good but the script was not all that to me but I'm sure you was reading the script in your head it would sound good. Sorry. 
 The comedic might of Pryor and Gleason couldn't save this dog from the tissue-thin plot weak script dismal acting and laughable continuity in editing this mess together. It has a very few memorable moments but the well dries up quickly. As a kid I remember this as a Luke-warm vehicle for the two actor-comedians but there was always something strange about the flow and feeling of what was being conveyed in each scene and how this ties to the plot overall. Watching it again after many years it screams schlock-a-mania. I'm not so concerned with the racial controversy as I wouldn't mind seeing a movie take that issue on with a little levity. The most obvious fault to me is that the scenes are laid out like a jumbled non-related series of 2 minute situation comedy bits (any not very good ones at that) that were stapled together by the editor after an all-nighter at the local watering hole. Characters change feelings and motivations on a dime without rhyme nor reason between scenes and within scenes making this feel as though no one had any idea of what to get out of the screenplay. Not that it was any gem to start with. I feel bad for the two actors whose legacy is marred by this disaster that should never have been made. Maybe my sense of humor has become too refined... 
 This movie fails to offer anything new to a genre that has traditionally shown the cross cultural love story underpinned by the politics mid 20th century / pre-WWII India where the British and their modern ways are bad and the primitive but honest and true Indians are good. Surely such clichd depictions of the British are rather pass now. Apart from the drama that fuels the second part of the movie the narrative is predictable the acting is pedestrian and two-dimensional and the directing obvious and unimaginative. The story really needed to be fleshed out and would certainly have benefited from another half an hour of screen time to give the characters and narrative more depth and give the viewer something to feel some investment in. All in all rather uninspiring. Oh and Linus Roache just cannot do tragedy - going cross-eyed with emotional pain just doesn't work for me! 
 I just finished reading a book on Anita Loos' work and the photo in TCM Magazine of MacDonald in her angel costume looked great (impressive wings) so I thought I'd watch this movie. I'd never heard of the film before so I had no preconceived notions about it whatsoever. Thought it got off to a cute start with Eddy as the playboy and MacDonald as the secretary he doesn't know exists. The scene where she shows up at the costume party in her simple angel outfit with an uncooperative halo and wings that won't stay on was really endearing. I was even with the film when Eddy goes to sleep and imagines her as a real angel. But after a while it just started to fall apart for me. Eddy stays asleep for the entire rest of movie so it's all a dream. Whatever happens from there on doesn't really matter because he's just dreaming. The rest of it was pretty much plot less and pointless. I had to force myself to stick with it. And the final number where MacDonald goes from musical number to musical number in some mad hallucination was just plain freaky. Had Eddy woken a sooner and the original story continued or had he really married an angel I think it would have been a lot more interesting. I wanted to see more of her real character. There weren't really enough musical numbers to call it a musical. The first few songs were good but the jitterbug number that MacDonald performs was like nails on a chalkboard. Completely wrong for her operatic voice. Even so Eddy and MacDonald still manage to shine showing what true stars they were. 
 Wow... I picked this up at the local Wal-Mart after reading online that it had been released early. I've been following this online for some time and just had to buy the film. Wow... I guess the thing that really struck me was the editing or lack thereof. Time and again characters (usually The Narrator and whoever he is with) are shown walking...and walking...and walking. I am not an editor but I do know that you can cut between someone leaving point A to show them arriving at point B. There is no need to show almost the entire journey! Wow... I actually ended up feeling somewhat sorry for the actors involved in this. They seem to have been given no direction as to what to do during scenes other than to look scared or look happy depending on what action was to be added at a later date. Wow... Why it was decided to do almost all the effects using CG is beyond me. Even ILM still employs miniatures sometimes. One of the most distracting uses of green screen in this film is the constant rushing about of (according to the end credits) the same group of people representing the citizenry of different towns and cities including London. At times these folk are coming and going with no regard as to the angle of the shot or the distance they are from the camera. In one shot in London there appear to be at least two men over six feet tall walking just behind the narrator's brother (played by star Anthony Piana without his distracting mustache). Not since GETTYSBURG have I seen such a fake piece of facial hair. Wow... Why Timothy Hines talked up this film the way he did is beyond me. It is a turkey plain and simple. On the plus side (at least for me) it has provided some of the most genuine laugh-out-loud bits of hilarity I have seen in quite a while. 
 I don't think this movie was rated correctly. I took my copy and blacked out the PG rating and wrote down R. I would NOT recommend this for anyone under 17 or 18 whatever the R limit is. Why? It contains a scene in the jungle with several topless Indian women. I don't know about you but that's not something for little children to be watching. True it might be the traditional clothing style of the African (?) Indians but... I think partial nudity should give a movie an R rating. I haven't seen the movie recently but I guess otherwise it was alright. 
 This movie is so so so horrible that it makes angels lose their wings. Shaq had tried to make other crossover efforts like his work in Shaq-Fu for the NES and his plethora of unbearable rap albums and later the epic serving of horrible film-making that is Steel. There's not a single good thing to be said about this movie. I saw it a bunch of times when I was very young but I must've been an idiot then because this movie takes all that is enjoyable about films and tears it apart. It's fun to mock. I saw it on the Disney Channel a while back and spent a few minutes doing that. Although once the thrill of mocking it is done you still become overwhelmed by its terribleness. If you see it on TV try this: consider as your watching the film removing from it all the scenes in which Shaq uses his magical genie powers. If you do that it becomes like a film about a pedophile chasing a kid and rapping to seduce him. That's kinda funny and disturbing. A horrible example of film. Do not unless looking to mock it see this movie. 
 This movie sucked plain and simple. Okay so it's basically about a girl that gets raped and to get revenge she gets another guy to rape the rapist. The rapist is a douche but the girl victim is partly to blame. I mean they both get in the mood and start kissing and stuff but when the rapist tries to have sex with her she doesn't allow it so the rapist rapes her. And the thing is the rape scene for the girl is very short and it doesn't really expose or show anything but when it comes to the rapist getting raped it's a pretty long rape scene. There is basically nothing in the story that is worth watching. 3.2/10 
 This movie really shows its age. The print I saw was terrible due to age but it is possible that there are better prints out there. However this was not the major problem with the movie. The problem was that although the film was made in 1933 it was essentially a silent film with only the barest of dialog scattered (only a few sentences) in the film in the most amateur fashion. Sometimes the characters' backs were turned or they were talking with their hands over their faces--all in a pathetic attempt to obscure their lips and cleaverly (?) hide the fact that the film was dubbed. Well its true that this Czech film would need to be dubbed into many languages but to do it this way was really stupid and obvious. It just looked cheap. Overall the film looked low budget and silly. It's really a shame though because there was a grain of a good story--a young woman who marries an older man who is either gay and/or has no interest in women. But in the 21st century few people would really be willing to sit through this archaic mess. EVEN with a few glimpses of the naked (and somewhat chunky) Hedy Lamarr it isn't worth all the fuss that accompanied the film when it debuted. Even by 1933 standards this film was a poorly made dud. About the only interesting thing about the film is to see how different Lamarr looked in 1933 compared with the glamorous image Hollywood created when she came to America--she looks like 2 completely different people. It's such an incomplete looking and technically inferior film I don't see how it has gotten such rave reviews. For technical problems alone the movie can't rate a 10 or anything near it. 
 It had to be You is another sign that Hollywood is running out of ideas. This picture is about Charlie Hudson a former police officer turned Author. When Charlie's fianc goes out of town he's stuck with all of the wedding planning. He spends a week at a fancy hotel and meets Anna Penn a teacher who just happens to also be getting married. The two quickly become friends and set out to plan their separate weddings together. This is when the plot gets boring Charlie falls in love with Anna and she has to choose between a safe life or Charlie. This movie rips off every romantic comedy ever made and just has you waiting for the end of the movie so you can do something else. Micahel Vartan and Natasha Henstridge give really mediocre performances which just makes this movie all the more gut wrenching to watch. 
 Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his self titled debut this time it's a film that's played for erm?laughs. While on a diving trip Rome finds the body of a blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea her feet as you might expect encased in cement. Rome immediately on the case after being hired by man mountain Waldo Gronsky. Rome finds himself immediately at risk as he has to investigate some mafia types who turn the tables on him and he is himself found to be the main suspect he must now go on the run and hope to solve the case alone. The portly Sinatra tries hard to sell us the lame jokes and make us believe he is a good detective oh and not to mention being sexually attractive to the foxy Raquel Welch but he fails miserably in this ham fisted vanity project. The frankly laughable denouement that surrounds every female is quite astounding every woman in the film is a dither head who likes bending over is front of the camera Director Douglas of course obliges in zooming in on the cracks of their asses each time as they flex their posterior muscles. There's even a ridiculously campy gay character that beggars belief this was a film made by real men for real men to reaffirm their own flagging sexuality it's a shameful shambles. 
 Hooper is Not Funny Not Fasted paced Not romantic and Non informative. There is no real drama. You would think that a movie about the world's greatest stuntman would have some drama there was an attempt but it didn't seem real. No Character study no lessons learned it did not even look like the actors were having any real fun they were just trying to act like they were having fun. There is no reason to watch unless you like to look at Burt and want get an occasional glimpse of Sally. Prancer the horse was beautiful and did what he was supposed to do. In fact Prancer was the best actor in this movie. Smoky and the Bandit was such a fun movie that I was ready to like Hooper. This movie turned out to be a real disappointment and waste of time 
 I just finished watching guinea pig - Devils experiment. I have to say that this movie although having very good FX better then I expected was NOT a good movie. I honestly cant say that I enjoyed this movie at all. Of course It is effective in its way of being a shocking realistic twisted 43 minutes of torture but I found it to be very boring (and not as gory as i hoped). And also I found that the torturers were very annoying when they talked and loughed trying to sound tough all the time that ruined it even more (and Im sure there's some people out there who will agree with me on that one). I have now seen guinea pig 1 2 3 5 and the best one out of those in my opinion is guinea pig 2 - Flowers of the flesh and blood. I wont say much more about Devils experiment other than Great fx descent acting from the girl annoying fu**ing torturers overall I give it 4 stars on account of the FX cos they are awesome. 
 Man the ending of this film is so terribly unwatchable and dated that my entire film aesthetics class laughed like crazy. Now most of the rest of the film was okay. It had a few unintentionally funny scenes but had a few real good camera shots and editing. Yes Alderich is a great director who made FLight Of The Phoenix and Whatever Happened TO Baby Jane among others. The problem isn't with direction acting or anything technical. The movie is just destroyed in the third act. Why? The murders twists turns and characters have all been revolving around NUCLEAR MATERIAL? What the heck was the writer smoking when he came up with that? The way it just comes out of nowhere may have been the biggest Deus Ex Machina in history. For all the complaints about Burton's Planet of the Apes THe life of David Gale or Notorious I think THIS is the worst ending ever. What a let down. 
 What Is It? is a mish-mash of bizarre recurring motifs (snails Shirley Temple swastikas and overtly racist music among others) unfettered by any sort of narrative or plot or character development. The whole thing struck me as self-consciously freak show and I don't mean only the unusual casting decisions. It has the feel of a bad acid trip far beyond any level of drug use one might attribute to Hunter S. Thompson or William S. Burroughs. The only movie to which I can compare it is Eraserhead (my second-least-favorite film of all time) which was by intent much more depressing but I still found What Is It? a total waste of my time. It's one thing to give me a peek into the inner workings of someone else's mind -- even someone else's chemically altered consciousness -- but quite another to just throw weird visuals at me purely for the sake of weirdness. 
 Supposedly a social commentary on racism and prison conditions in the rural South of the 1970's Nightmare is full of bad Southern stereotypes complete with phoney accents. Not only would it be offensive to the sensibilities of most American Southerners this tawdry piece of work comes off as just a thinly-disguised babe in prison movie--especially in its uncut original version. Nevertheless acting is generally above average and the late Chuck Connors in particular does a good job of making viewers hate him--even though he looks somewhat uncomfortable in several scenes. There's also a change-of-pace role for the late Robert Reed who appears as the lecherous warden and Tina Louise (previously Ginger of Gilligan's Island ) made a rather believable sadistic prison guard. My grade: D. 
 I am a huge Charlton Heston fan. He is without a doubt one of the greatest actors of all time but what was he thinking when he made this movie. Normally if he made a bad movie I could blame it on the screenwriter or director but in this case it's all him. The suckiness of this movie is all his fault. It proves that not even Heston can make a Shakespeare story interesting. I wasted 2 and a half hours of my life on this snooze fest and I'll never get that time back. This is by far THE WORST Heston movie that I've ever seen. If you are a Shakespeare fan maybe you'll find this movie entertaining but if you're not don't waste your time you'll regret it in the long run. 
 I don't know what the rest of you guys watch Steven Seagal movies for but I watch them because as silly as they are they're at least always good for a laugh. Why would you rate this movie a 1 out of 10 based on the dubbing when that kind of thing is exactly what makes a movie like this into a cult favorite that you can laugh at the silliness of? Attack Force is by no means a great movie but I felt it was as worthy a Steven Seagal vehicle as many of his other movies; in fact I didn't think it was one of his worst by a long-shot. It had most of the time a half-way coherent plot line and it was most of the time fundamentally exciting. The ending really sucked but even that had some enjoyably trashy elements. In the end the story itself did not deliver what it promised but I actually thought that the acting characterization (if I may use such a big word) and the rest of the production values delivered exactly what a true Steven Seagal fan would expect. Seagal himself in particular was exactly the stone-faced no-nonsense man's man that we've come to expect and the rest of the cast backed him up pretty well without ever up-staging him. This people is what a Steven Seagal movie does. Deal with it. Or even better: laugh at it. 4 out of 10. 
 This movie only got a 1 because you can't give a zero! if you have a weak tummy AT ALL don't watch. animal rights people you don't want to watch either. it makes people vegetarians i swear i witnessed it happen! the only cool parts are the case and the fact that its a true story. its really really super creepy that this guy worked at ADT while he killed people! still feel safe when you punch in that little code? i don't! He had access to every code in Kansas!!!!!! I hated the movie it was not scary it was mentally scaring! Do your self a favor and don;t rent/buy this movie i think it cost about $20 to make that INCLUDES their OVER paid actors!!!! 
 I really wanted to like this movie a lot more than I did. That's because I love wacky foreign comedies--particularly the strange ones that catch you completely by surprise. However although this one frequently caught me by surprise these were almost never pleasant surprises. It reminded me of South Park in that nearly EVERY social norm was violated until the only ones left to broach were too sick to be funny. For example after exploring adultery drug abuse (of nearly every sort--ranging from pot heroin speed to glue sniffing) prostitution S&M suicide murder etc. the movie got to the hilarious(?) topic of pedophilia. Mom encouraged her one son (who looked about 12 years-old) to sleep with neighboring men. In fact at one point in the movie she gives this boy to the dentist in lieu of payment for dental work! Funny?! You've got to be kidding. This movie just goes too far and delves into the black hole of comedy . What should they make fun of next cancer or rectal tumors? 
 Uwe Boll has done the impossible: create a game adaptation that stays at least somewhat true to the game; he has turned a game full of antisocial and offensive content into a movie full of antisocial and offensive content. So as an adaptation it's a success. Unfortunately it's still Uwe Boll we are dealing with here so don't expect the movie to be actually any good. while it does have it's moment Postal wears out his welcome very fast and becomes a pain to sit through. At its core Postal is a satire on the United States as done by a twelve year old kid. Boll seems to think that offensiveness is linearly proportional to comedic value: the more offensive the funnier and the more exaggerated the funnier. This results in a movie that sets new levels of tastelessness while being extremely hit and miss. Yes some gags do work but it seems to be pure luck. High points include the director satirizing himself and people getting hit very violently by trucks and other vehicles. Low points include..well pretty much everything else. After the initial surprise wears off Postal simply becomes a bore to watch. Yes there is a good joke every and good point ten minutes but everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters shooting and chasing each other all over the place for what seems to be an eternity. This probably would have worked as a short movie but it's just not enough content for something that lasts over 90 minutes (although it feels twice as long). There are nice ideas and nice tries but they get hopelessly lost in endless and pointless action scenes and content that is offensive just for the sake of it 4/10 
 I saw this movie just now not when it was released and hailed as best picture of the year here in Israel. and to summarize everything right now I will just say: this is not a good film. This is Dror Shaul's second feature film and I have to admit that his first and the TV drama he made before this picture are much better. further more this is his first attempt at directing a drama. the early works were comedies and were funny and effective. The first thing you have to know if you'll ever see this film: Israel of the 21st century hates the kibbutz and the values it represented since the formation of the state of Israel. the real situation of the kibbutzim is very dire and some of them disappear one by one. the kibbutz Hebrew word for collective was a sort of village for members only where the values of equality and socialism were the dogma for everyday life. with the change in social values with time it seems now that the kibbutz was a place where the human spirit was repressed locked within the dogma rules with no ticket out. the entrance of capitalist values and way of life in the 90's and so far made it very hard on the kibbutzim to survive. the crazy mother in the film is the central metaphor for that. But I regard this film as having nothing to do with nostalgia for the good old days of the kibbutz. once it was a dream of every young couple to live in a kibbutz and raise children in this quite and beautiful environment. but the film shows the opposite. that the kibbutz with it's socialist dogma was a place sort of like a cult of crazy people with crazy ideas that undermine the freedom of each individual within the collective. this is the central philosophy of post modern capitalism: your individuality is the most important thing. you must place yourself in the center and no one else but you is the matter. this is the philosophy the film stands for and that's just it's first sin. If you disagree with me on the political side I'm sure you will agree that the acting the tone of the film it's script and it's direction are the four sins that follow. the film has no real visual text and none of it's shots is something to remember. it is also very delicate a delicacy that is no more than artsy fartsy attempt to provoke emotions which do not surface not in the film and not with the viewer. it brings nothing but boredom. Can someone please explain: why this film won so many prizes? maybe because it shows that Israel is in line with the rest of the world hating socialist and human values? or maybe it shows that Israel is a delicate place not giving in to dogmas and fanaticism? that we are basically very human and good people capable of emotions especially when they are fake ones just like capitalism expects us to be? or maybe because it tells one of the biggest lies of Israeli cinema in recent years a lie that undermines the justification of the existence of the Jewish state? no matter what the answer is it's not a good one. not for the world not for human values and not for the Jews. 
 I think the Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy! I know I wouldn't have the nerve to go even 5 feet away from a croc. But everything in this movie is bad. Farting jokes people getting eaten and the skit about the President all make the movie one of the worst of all time. It's a really bad film that you have to stay away from. All the jokes are so juvenile that you will find yourself laughing because they are so stupid. The plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is 4 years old. I'm surprised the Croc Hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat him after he saw this. 
 Man I really find it hard to believe that the wonderful Alan Ball had anything to do with this mess. Having seen the first two episodes thus far I think I can safely say this show isn't going to be on my must see list. It's just got so many things working against it. None of the actors cast are particularly good. Anna Paquin as the lead character Sookie is just awful. I remember her being better in a lot of other things I've seen her in so maybe it's just the writing. She's not really much fun to look at either there are moments where to be honest she looks downright ugly. The actor who plays Bill is marginally better if only because his character is supposed to be sort of wooden and aloof. The other actors do their best but with the clich characters with difficult to perform accents they are given it's a tough job. Tara is an absolute misery to watch Rutina Wesley absolutely murders the accent. It's like nails on a chalkboard bad. Almost as awful is Nelsan Ellis it's difficult to understand what he's even saying sometimes. Both his character as well as Tara's also seem a bit racist to me. I don't know having a character say 'whycome' on an HBO show that isn't The Wire just seems a bit odd. Rounding out the cast so far are Sookie's doddering grandmother her sex addict brother and the only bit of genius casting I've seen in William Sanderson as the sheriff. The story seems to be meandering towards it's destination at this point with no real worry about keeping the viewer interested. The romance stuff is very Dark Shadow-sy. Although this show ups the camp factor from something like those old Dark Shadows episodes times about ten. At times it seemed so campy to me that I just have to assume it was intended to be. But unlike a show such as Buffy that pulled camp off masterfully this show does not. Out of place with the campiness is the extreme gore and graphic sex of the show. I'm not averse to either of these when they are done well as they have in many other HBO shows but here at least they prolonged rough sex scenes involving Jason Stackhouse seem a bit over the top and pointless. About the only nice thing I can really think to say about this mess is that I liked the opening title sequence. HBO has had a string of bad luck with their shows lately I hope they cancel this after the first season and try to get something better on the air. 
 This is one of the worst movies I saw! I dunno what are the reasons for shoting suck a crap. Don't waste your time watching this. Good actors but extremely bad screenplay and dialogues. Hope there'll be no Blanche 2 :-) Avoid this movie by all means! 
 - When the local sheriff is killed his wife takes over until and is determined to clean-up the town. Not everyone in town however is happy with what she's doing. When the sheriff orders a curfew in town the local saloon owner (also a woman) hires a killer to take care of the sheriff. There's no way the saloon owner could know that the sheriff and the killer would fall in love. - Gunslinger is an example of what happens when you have a fairly interesting concept and combine it with poor execution. There's a good movie here somewhere trying to get out. In more capable hands or with a larger budget Gunslinger might have been an entertaining look at the role of women in the Old West. As it is Gunslinger is a sloppy mess of a movie. - There are just so many things wrong with the movie: a supporting cast with no acting ability stilted and unnatural dialogue and sets that look like sets. But the biggest offender is the editing. I was amazed at how many times a scene would begin with the actors (and horses for that matter) obviously waiting for Corman to yell Action . The best is the scene of two riders on horseback just standing beside a building. All of a sudden they take off and come racing around the corner like they had been riding hard for several miles. Or take the example of people who can seemingly transport themselves across town. We see a man enter a building and a second later emerge across town to mount his horse. - It's not as if Corman didn't have a few decent actors to work with. While none were great stars Beverly Garland John Ireland and Allison Hayes were all capable of turning in a good performance. But in Gunslinger they're not given much to work with. - I have now seen both the MST3K and non-MST3K versions of the movie. I would strongly recommend going the MST3K route. 
 Well I can once and for all put an end to the question: 'What is the worst movie ever made...ever?' It is Flight of Fury starring and co-written by Steven Seagal. Sure there are lots of famously bad movies but this one takes the cake in that it takes itself so seriously. It is a Romanian-made film that speaks to just how far Romania has to go to catch up with Bollywood. It also speaks to just how utterly devoid of intellect and talent Steven Seagal has become. This movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after watching it and need to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again. It was released only on video (I can't imagine why) and I suspect the workers that had to make the DVD's had to wear protective gear and receive regular counseling. 
 Oh brother. The only reason this very irritating film avoids getting the total bomb from me is because it's at least historically noteworthy as the first Three Stooges film (when they weren't yet on their own and were still saddled with that painfully unfunny Ted Healy). But even as a longtime Stooges fan I'd have to say that young Moe Larry and Curly are badly used here as three zany assistant janitors to Mr. Healy's taller boss janitor. They're not featured steadily through the movie and their silly on-and-off-again stints paint them more like zany overactive cartoon characters trying too hard to be amusing. Most of this toothache deals with Jack Pearl seeking in vain to get some chuckles from the audience himself as a man who impersonates Baron Munchausen (here's a good example of the level of humor: I object! On what grounds? Coffee grounds! ). His sidekick is none other than a young Jimmy Durante but even the schnoz himself is a bore. 
 I very nearly walked out but I'd paid my money and my nearly-as-disgusted friend wanted to hold out. After the endearing wide-eyed innocence of A New Hope and the thrilling sophistication of The Empire Strikes Back I remember awaiting Return of the Jedi with almost aching anticipation. But from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage I was bitterly disappointed and enraged at Lucas. He should have been ashamed of himself but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesn't have subatomic particle of shame in his cold greedy heart. Episode I would go on to reinforce this fact -- your honor I call Jarjar Binks (but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury first). From the initial raising of the gate at Jabba's lair this film was nothing more than a two-plus-hour commercial for as many licensable profit-making action figures as Lucas could cram into it -- the pig-like guards the hokey flesh-pigtailed flunky that vile muppet-pet of Jabba's the new and recycled cabaret figures the monsters etc. etc. ad vomitum. Then there were the detestably cute and marketable Ewoks. Pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens. Fifteen seconds each on-screen (or less) and the kiddies just GOTTA have one for their collection. The blatant exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseating. Lucas didn't even bother to come up with a new plot -- he just exhumed the Death Star from A New Hope and heaved in a boatload of cheap sentiment. What an appalling slap in the face to his fans. I can't shake the notion that Lucas took a perverse pleasure in inflicting this dreck on his fans: I've got these lemmings hooked so bad that I can crank out the worst piece of stinking putrid garbage that I could dream up and they'll flock to the theaters to scarf it up. Plus all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped cartoonish caricature that I stuffed in and I get a cut from every single one. It'll make me even more obscenely rich. There may have been a paltry partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable rip-off. I seem to recall that Harrison Ford managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this cesspool. But whatever tiny few bright spots there may be are massively obliterated by the offensive commercialism that Lucas so avariciously embraced in this total absolute sell-out to profit. 
 Film version of Sandra Bernhard's one-woman off-Broadway show is gaspingly pretentious. Sandra spoofs lounge acts and superstars but her sense of irony is only fitfully interesting and fitfully funny. Her fans will say she's scathingly honest and that may be true. But she's also shrill with an unapologetic in-your-face bravado that isn't well-suited to a film in this genre. She doesn't want to make nice--and she's certainly not out to make friends--and that's always going to rub a lot of people the wrong way. But even if you meet her halfway her material here is seriously lacking. Filmmaker Nicolas Roeg served as executive producer and though not directed by him the film does have his chilly detached signature style all over it. Bernhard co-wrote the show with director John Boskovich; their oddest touch was in having all of Sandra's in-house audiences looking completely bored--a feeling many real viewers will most likely share. *1/2 from **** 
 I can catogoricaly and unequivocally say that in all my 51 years on this planet that is the worse (supposibly children's) film i have ever seen in my life. I took my three grand children to see it and even they were struggling to raise a smile during the all tortuous 90 mins. The sexual indendoes i will leave for another day but they were as tasteless as the film. They should pay YOU to watch it not you pay them. It's truly truly awful there is no other way to describe it. The people that made this film should be brought to task for taking money under false pretences. Aplogise for my spelling mistakes but i am so upset that it spoilt the time i had with my grandchildren Regards Stephen 
 ***SPOILERS*** Let's start with the good of this film--the serviceable acting of Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton. The rest of the acting is awful (this isn't aided by the atrocious script). The worst culprit is the villain Buntao the head of an Asian crime syndicate (played by Frans Tumbuan). I was laughing my head off as he was expressing his fury over having lost a bunch of money; horrid performance. Patrick Muldoon isn't much better and his it's a hostile takeover line (that's the remainder of the title of this film) was delivered about as badly as one could do it. There are no other main characters but no other actor/actress distinguished him/herself in this film. We next come to the plot. This should tell you all you need to know: In the original Rage and Honor Cynthia Rothrock who plays Chris Fairchild was a teacher in the inner city. Now she's a C.I.A. agent (or was it some other governmental agency--sorry but this film was so bad that I don't even remember). Hmmm...I can imagine what that C.I.A. application process was like. Interviewer: What past job experience do you have? Chris: I was a teacher. Interviewer: Okay; you're hired! I only give it a 2 because of some decent acting and a nice plot twist at the end (though we know that Tommy (Muldoon) the secret villain will be caught). 
 All right I recently got a chance to rent this and watch Santa Claus conquers the martains. Although the children were much more sadistic in SCCTM I would have to say that Santa Claus was a much worse movie. As a spanish assignment in Spanish 5 we all had to watch it. I'll tell you usually when we watch a movie we are all just talking and eating food but not for this movie. Everyone just kept there jaw open wondering what the evil Mr. Pitch was going to do next. Would Merlin help Santa Claus!?! or would his robot reindeer come and save the day? I would suggest renting it because it is the biggest piece of rubbish I have ever seen and I love it for that. :D 
 First up this film according to the slick said it won best film at Worldfest Film festival in Houston Texas. Hmmm must have been a quiet year. Wouldn't call this the worst film ever but it certainly sucks is pretty much just as terrible as other Aussie B grader Body Melt but at least that film didn't look like it was shot on HI 8 video. My guess is the film makers watched a lot of Troma films and really bad B grade gore films thinking that they too could crack into the business releasing this film. Don't get me wrong I love really low grade films Just the fact that some of the characters put on fake American accents almost as if doing so would give them more chance to sell it in the states or something. Really disappointing ending as well the showdown could have been way more exciting and some good fight scenes. You can completely see that the film makers are trying to copy Bad Taste with the whole car explosion rocket launcher and endless amount of people being gunned down yet the finale lacks any over the top humour or style like bad taste . If you like watching really bad gore films or are interested in no-budget film making watch it otherwise stay away. 
 I gave this a four purely out of its historical context. It was considered lost for many years until it popped up out of the blue on Showtime in the early nineties. Moe is the straight man and Larry and Curly act as a duo. Spade Cooley has a couple of numbers. I guess it had something to do with working on a ranch. I'm not quite sure because the plot was so minimal nothing really sticks in my memory. I vaguely remember it being a western musical comedy. Even the Stooge's seem to be going through the motions. Overall there's nothing much really to recommend here. If you're not a Stooge fan then don't bother. If you are a Stooge fan then stick with the shorts. 
 Seeing this movie as I just did for the first time on Turner Classic (which lists it as Dangerous Female ) can only multiply your appreciation for the 1941 Bogart-Astor version. Ricardo Cortez must have been getting paid by the smirk. I hope he remembered his dentist and his Brylcreem salesman in his will; they made him the actor he was. The women are all good but no better than that. Well Una Merkel is a little better. More interesting are the original Joel Cairo and Mr. Gutman who competently deliver many of the individual tics but almost nothing of the set-changing atmospherics of their successors in the roles Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor somehow transcended the essential seediness of their characters in the remake; here Sam Spade and Ruth Wonderley(!) can't. This movie doesn't exactly stink; it lies there like a big slice of ham. Its chief value today is as a reminder that great movies like the '41 Falcon don't just happen. On the 1-to-10 scale I rate it a 4 mainly for the camera work and the supporting players. 
 A young scientist Harry Harrison is continuing his late father's scientific research into limb regeneration with flying colours but his interferingly dominate mother and her doctor lover want to sell off the serum. When he finds out there is an accident involving Harry losing an arm. So he tries out the serum and what eventuates is a genetically deranged arm that has a mind of its own. Oh we've seen this oh so many times before but what lifts this very campy and quite rubbery shonky junk is the performance of movie icons Elke Sommer and Oliver Reed. Actually it's not a bad flick by Fangoria films; just there are better ones out there which are similar in vein. Servered Ties simply lacks it own distinctive style. The oddball nature and unpleasant splatter resembled Re-animator and even a touch of slapstick stuck out like something from Evil Dead 2 . The comic story is truly whacked out with it's black humour but it can get melodramatic and a bit in dry in the fun factor. Surprises do crop up especially the flick's final outcome. Which is well accepted as I thought it could have copped out with something more accessible. For a low-budget production the FX makeup can look rigid and very goofy but there's some grotesque moments that will make you smile than actually cringe. Even a brush of sexual tension streamlines the story thanks to Elke Sommer's sternly juicy performance as the mother. Oliver Reed is quite humorously deadpan in a wicked sense and he pulls it off extremely well. They were both immensely diverting as the couple you loved to hate. Billy Morrisette is delightful in a erratic performance as Harry. Director Damon Santostefano briskly paces the film and orchestrates some stylish scenes of gripping and bamboozling horror. Yeah it's juvenile and basically silly nonsense but you got to hand it to it for some undemanding entertainment. 
 ** HERE BE SPOILERS ** Recap: Mia (Helin) is returning home from capital Stockholm to rural R?ttvik to celebrate her fathers 70th birthday. She is by far the youngest child and has two sisters Eivor (Ernst) and Gunilla (Petrn). Eivor has a family and still lives in R?ttvik and Gunilla has divorced and moved a town away. Mia is still single and is focused on her career. There are a lot of jealousy and almost animosity between the sisters and conflicts arise all around as they confront each other and each have personal problems they have difficult to handle. As the party goes on (and alcohol consumed) more and more secrets become unveiled and more and more conflicts arise... Comments: To be the work of a new writer/director it was disappointing to see this movie to follow in the exact same tracks that older Swedish comedy/dramas has been following for years. There are really no new elements or ideas. This movie draws upon three basic areas. 1) Embarrassing humor only based on characters making a fool of themselves. 2) Sorrow and 3) Anxiety. This move has the focus on the last one almost forgetting the first point as the movie goes along. No loss though since the humor that is there is not funny. The performances from the cast are good I guess though it is lost behind all the anguish and soon forgotten. I had hopes that there would be new ideas and influences but there were none. To conclude there are better ways to spend one's time than watching this. 3/10 
 This is going to be the most useless comment I have ever put down but yet I must do it to warn you about the atrocity to cinema that Freddy's Dead is. It is not only the very worst chapter of the Nightmare series but is right up there with the worst horror sequel of all time! It was boring pointless and nearly death free. The horrible 3-D ending and over-the-top CORNY kills are enough to drive this film into the ground. However it doesn't stop there just add bad acting a terrible script and a number of cheesy cameos and you've got yourself this heaping pile of guano! It's no wonder why Freddy as always played by Robert Englund has made two postmortem appearances. I would too if I went out like that. This is a strictly fans only movie don't stare at our shame. 
 Ignoring (if possible) the tediously gratuitous marijuana smoking (which seems to be mandatory in Australian government-funded films) the cast of this movie gives a reasonably credible performance. That's a far as it goes. The rest is simply awful. The plot's overburdened with wow symbolisms which are meant to look good on film but go nowhere. A gross example is the giant peach float obviously left over from a town parade and donated by the local canning factory. It was just too tempting to waste what was hopefully a free but nevertheless irrelevant prop! The peach is given a cursory unexplained wash-down at one stage but that's where it ends. Similarly the contrived black spot road sign where Steph's parents were killed is intended to symbolize the eventual escape from her past but her escape to what? She's had a pretty good deal where she was especially considering her visual disability and the unending loving patience and care of her understanding young female guardian. The Guinness' prize for corny melodrama however goes to the characterization of Alan. Alan successfully aspires to the noble role of trade union shop steward but rats on his fellow workers by becoming a supervisor for a wicked multi-national - hiss! hiss! As a supervisor Alan performs the boss' villainous dirty work. He implements redundancies until surprise surprise the whole plant is closed and Alan himself is left as a pathetic unemployed failure. No clich-free zones here mate! Not only this but Alan also loses the seductive Steph from the most unlikely relationship you'd encounter. If you think the plot is melodramatic and didactic don't ask about detail. What's the significance of the shaving cream on Steph's seductive leg? Why doesn't the hotel where the couple makes love eventually twig that someone's gaining illegal entry to one of its grandest bedrooms and among other pandemoniums the sheets are regularly soiled - quite spectacularly on one occasion. Summing this movie up in one word: Avoid Avoid Avoid. 
 A yawn-inducing snail-paced disappointment Inside Man tells the story of a detective (Denzel Washington) who is under investigation due to his possible involvement in a case of missing money. When a bank is robbed and hostages are held against their will by a mastermind thief (Clive Owen) and his team the detective is assigned to coerce the thief to surrender ? his one shot at proving he is innocent and worthy of his position. Enter a powerful woman (Jodie Foster) with secrets and intents of her own sent to recover an item from the bank owner's safety deposit box that is stored within the bank and you have quite the three-way dilemma. Unfortunately all you get it set-up in the film and nothing pays off in the end. Denzel Washington is at his most uninteresting in an ineffective and distastefully egocentric performance. The only saving grace for the film is its competent co-stars Jodie Foster and Clive Owen who are much better than the film itself. In fact Jodie Foster delivers the most surprising and high-caliber performance playing against type as a ruthless cutthroat villain of sorts. Clive Owen isn't given much to do besides brood and pose but the depth of his presence and his achieved acting ability more than make up for his underdeveloped role. It's strange that so much talent is wasted on this film of little impact or interest. You have to wonder what director Spike Lee was thinking while he was creating this film. The most perplexing aspect of Inside Man however is how much unwarranted praise it has received. For a film that seemed to have all the makings of a pre-summer blockbuster this one falls horribly flat. 
 (aka: BLOOD CASTLE or SCREAM OF THE DEMON) *spoiler* This was a drive-in feature co-billed with THE VELVET VAMPIRE. A Spanish-Italian co-production where a series of women in a village are being murdered around the same time a local count named Yanos Dalmar is seen on horseback riding off with his 'man-eating' dog behind him. The townsfolk already suspect he is the one behind it all and want his castle burned down. The murders first began around the time Count Yanos' older brother Count Igor Dalmar was horribly burned and killed in a lab accident. Then a woman Ivanna (Erna Schuer) that Igor hired before his death to assist him in his experiments shows up. Yanos agrees to hire her in place of his brother and together they seek the formulae for the regeneration of dead cells. Yanos wants to bring Igor's charred corpse back to life. But of course Igor is still alive (although horribly burned) and stalking and killing the women in the village. We see his char-broiled face appear at various points in the film so we know he's still alive making the whole thing seem a little bit too obvious. Igor meets another fiery end when he gets into a fight with Yanos over Ivanna with the burning candles falling on to the same bed that Igor stumbles on to meeting yet another final char-broiled end. The Retromedia DVD is taken from a VHS source and looks quite grainy and bad. Other than an even scratchier trailer no other extras are included. Although it has a nice creepy Spanish castle and good atmospherics I found it to be fairly boring and predictable with no excitement or mystery whatsoever. 3 out of 10. 
 John Carradine John Ireland and Faith Domergue who as players all saw better days in better films got together for this Grade G horror film about life imitating art in a mysterious mansion. For Carradine it was in those last two decades of his career that he appeared in anything on the theory it was better to keep working no matter what you did and get those paychecks coming in. With that magnificent sonorous voice of his Carradine was always in great demand for horror pictures and the man did not discriminate in the least in what he appeared in. He plays the caretaker of an old Gothic mansion who movie director John Ireland has rented for his latest low budget slasher film. It's even got a graveyard but with a missing occupant. Faith Domergue is Ireland's aging star and Carole Wells is the young ingenue. In the last twenty minutes or so most of the cast winds up dead that aren't dead already. The script is so incoherent I'm still trying to figure out the point. I won't waste any more gray matter on it. 
 I do not fail to recognize Haneke's above-average film-making skills. For example I appreciate his lingering on unremarkable-natural-day-lighted settings as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism. However regarding the content of this film I am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still an urge to pathologize domination-submission relations or feelings (and/or BDSM practices). The problem that the main character has with her mother is unbelievably topical as is the alienation and uncomprehension felt by Walter (I don't mean the frustration of a lover which is not loved back in the same way which is understandable; I mean that he looks upon her as if she were crazy or as if he was a monk come on!). I mean D/s is not something new in the world and I think it is rather silly to treat the subject as if it were something freakish or pathological; it isn't. In general films dealing with this subject are really lagging behind the times. So for me I feel that this film ends up being quite a programmatical film worried with very outdated psicoanalitical theories (isn't it nearly embarrassing?) and that does not really relate with real-life lives and experiences of those engaged in D/s relationships (personal experience forums irc chatrooms even recent scholar studies will show this). 
 The plot is about the death of little children. Hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings. During the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter. In the end the serial killer get caught. That's it. But before you find out who dunnit you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actors. It is unbelievable how bad these actors are including Hopper. I could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time. Just don't watch the movie. I've warned you. 
 If this movie were any worse it would have been directed by Uwe Boll. This nonsensical mess makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock. It has been a while since I have seen this steaming pile but I do remember that I wanted to do grievous bodily harm to all those involved. How anyone can give this movie any more than 1 star amazes me to the graciousness of all those that viewed this tripe. I give it one star because there is not a rating lower. All copies of this movie should be burned the ground sowed with salt and reserved as a landfill for the most toxic of waste. No one copy should be kept under ultra hi security and shown only to film makers as an example of how not to do it. 
 As others have pointed out this movie is a load of pretentious drivel for the mindless or masochists. We all know after seeing trainspotting and acid house that Scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world. But unlike trainspotting and acid house without a good dose of humour or gritty realism movies like this do not work. And even more importantly without a decent script a movie will not work and there is nothing new inspiring or thought provoking about the script for this movie. The fact that this movie won a couple of Bafta's shows how bad the British film industry is at the moment. I thought the Aussie movie industry was pretty bad at the moment but unfortunately the British industry is even worse. This movie is so bad I wouldn't even bother renting it from the weeklies section. Do yourself a favour and give this movie a wide berth. 
 This is a movie that demonstrates that mood and music and texture aren't enough to make a good film. Sure the viewer is treated to numerous fine scenes of Los Angeles in the thirties--I especially liked the view of the trolley approaching the tunnel and the tram rising up the hillside--but in a sense this fine cinematography is self-defeating because it creates a mood that something's going to happen --and nothing does. The script too keeps feinting toward some plot or action or trauma--and time after time not delivering. Not even delivering the (I assume) theme of the movie the characters' essential misfit. The lead actors both too pretty for their roles didn't convey any repression or agony and the script didn't expose us to any. Now Donald Sutherland? That's another story. His character was so well fashioned so perfectly played that I wanted the camera to follow him. 
 A somewhat dull made for tv movie which premiered on the TBS cable station. Antonio and Janine run around chasing a killer computer virus and...that's about it. For trivia buffs this will be noted as debuting the same weekend that the real life 'Melissa' virus also made it's debut in e-mail inboxes across the world. 
 This movie starts out with a certain amount of promise; but in my view begins to lose it when the protagonist kidnaps the good Samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down. That this well-meaning stranger begins to fix his car while he is away making a phone call is implausible enough but that she is one of the few people in the country who can help him put his family's life back on track is the type of coincidence beginning writers are warned against using in their stories. I found this movie average at best. Art direction could have been much better as could have been cinematography. The acting was good and so was Eva van der Gucht's singing. 
 I would have left the movie halfway through if I hadn't been with people who liked it. The movie is based on real incidents but it's so over the top it didn't feel real at all. I have some psychological background hang out with a lot of psychotherapists and have known seriously crazy people so it's not that I think people like this don't exist. But in the film the only characters who seemed consistently human were Augusten's father (Alec Baldwin) and the young Augusten (Jack Kaedin). (Although Evan Rachel Wood was an intriguing diversion - very sexy with a wicked sense of fun). There were a few amusing moments but the overall tone of the movie was grim bizarre and nasty. What a waste of an outstanding cast! As I watched them go through their turns I just felt like I was watching an acting class. This was brought home during the credits when a couple of people were shown just sitting there not acting not talking. Those few moments were more entertaining than the previous 2 hours. 
 #1 Vampires vs. Humans #2 Military-reject roughneck squad as first responders to dangerous unknown Vampire incursions. #3 Sexy female Vampire on the side of the good guys . #4 Plenty of gore and action. There are four (4) major plot devices that may help you decide if you want to watch this movie. If you want all four then the next plot device may not deter you... #5 In outer space. That last one almost got me too but I'm glad I watched. In a pile of terrible direct-to-video horror that is the Sci-Fi channel Halloween marathon... this movie is a breath of fresh air. It will stand-up against any of the other Sci-Fi channel offerings and even against the other Vampire movie Natassia starred in (who keeps giving Uwe Boll money?). 
 I realize that bringing a novel to the big screen is always problematic. That is the only positive thing I can say about this truly horrid adaptation. Have you read 'Wise Blood?' It's an amazing book. Flannery O'Connor wrote about the south as no one else has. She was a southerner herself a devout catholic and a remarkably gifted writer. In her first novel she wove together a dark and deeply disturbing tale of faith doubt and redemption with a macabre sense of humor and surprising evenhandedness. The characters in the book may seem outrageous to those who have not lived in the rural south but I can assure you that such people do exist. Not only do they exist they are human beings with families feelings and concerns like anyone else. Flannery's intentions were so often misunderstood - she was not lampooning these backwoods zealots - she saw in them the beautiful operation of what she would have called 'grace'...even in the most violent distressing and maddening of circumstances. To read 'Wise Blood' is to be washed over with a sense of dread and impending doom. Finally it is to think long and hard about our judgments and preconceptions - our entire world view. None of this comes through in John Huston's 'Gilligan's Island'-like adaptation. None. It is a farce. A bad farce. The entire film is saturated with a hauteur that turns the stomach. The acting is poor the southern accents are fake and insulting. The filmmakers show no insight into the thinking of religious southerners. Ms. O'Connor's intense prose are reduced to sight gags and cheap amateur theatre. The soundtrack is a mixture of hayseed silliness and 'Clockwork Orange'-style cheeseball electronics that doesn't fit the story or even the MOVIE. I was granted free admission to this movie and almost walked out. Truly truly terrible. As an aside I do not agree with Ms. O'Connor's religious views and while I was raised in the deep south years ago I made my way north and have not looked back. But the south is a beautiful place full of fascinating individuals (like every other place on earth) and the cartoonish mockery with which southerners and their attitudes are dealt in this movie borders on offensive. If you're into being offended (which I am not) then this movie most DEFINITELY crosses the line. I don't like to talk crap about an artist's work - John Huston was a man that I did not know and I'm sure he was a sincere and gifted filmmaker to which his respected place in film history attests. My views are clearly skewed by having read (and loved) Flannery O'Connor's work. So I don't claim to be coming from any other perspective. Maybe as a stand-alone film it works for cinephiles. But for Flannery O'Connor fans - and I might add for self-respecting southerners and openminded individuals of all stripes - this movie is a waste of time. 
 After having red the overwhelming reviews this film got in my country I but wanted to see it. But - what a disappointment! To see a bunch of one-dimensional characters in a plot that lacks of originality is not worth the money and the time to spend. I sometimes wonder about the filmcritics in switzerland. 
 This movie got off to an interesting start. Down the road however the story gets convoluted with a poor illustration of ancient black magic rituals. The male lead was very good even though he gets the worst end of the stick in the climax. In comparison this is Boomerang meets Extremities . 
 I was really looking forward to seeing this film but after watching it I was really disappointed. The best bit was when Stephen King was in it. Rober John Berk cannot act to save his life and neither can any of the others. A few of the performances even made me laugh out loud! The film was was not as I imagined it after reading the book which was awesome I imagined it darker and a lot scarier. If i was Stephen I would be really mad! I don't know why they changed the ending I thought the ending of the book was very good. If you just found out the pie killed your daughter you wouldn't feed it to anyone else would you?! Book was so much better! 
 No wonder this movie never saw the light of day. The timing was of the release was awful. The Gong Show had already jumped the shark by the time the movie came out so who would pay money just to see a few of the censored clips from the original run of the show? And the show clips are just a tiny bit of this pathetic 90-minute whine by Chuck Barris about how hard his life was as host of the show. Did he really expect we would feel sorry for him and his messed-up millionaire life? Did he really think we even wanted to KNOW about his life? (Obviously so since he later wrote his weird autobiography about his career as a CIA operative.) Did he think the gag of having everyone everywhere audition for him would stay fresh for 90 minutes? Or the network executive hounding him at every turn? This might have worked as the plot for a 30-minute sitcom episode but not as a full-length movie. However it was nice to see Rip Taylor Gene Gene and the Unknown Comic again (although to make the movie spicy they included only his most vulgar routines). And as someone else has pointed out this is Phil Hartman's first significant movie part (even though it lasts only a minute). Note his name is spelled HARTMANN in the credits which is the name he was born with. You can't miss his voice and facial expressions even though he's much thinner and younger than in the SNL days. Ed Molinaro (Hill Street Blues) also has a tiny part; one of his first after leaving the soap world. 
 Robert Colomb has two full-time jobs. He's known throughout the world as a globetrotting TV reporter. Less well-known but equally effortful are his exploits as a full-time philanderer. I saw `Vivre pour Vivre' dubbed in English with the title 'Live for Life.' Some life! Robert seems to always have at least three women in his life: one mistress on her way out one on her way in and the cheated wife at home. It helps that Robert is a glib liar. Among his most useful lies are `I'll call you tomorrow' and `My work took longer than planned.' He spends a lot of time and money on planes trains and hotel rooms for his succession of liaisons. You wonder when this guy will get caught with his pants down. Some may find his life exciting but I thought it to be tedious. His companions including his wife Catherine are all attractive and desirable women. But his lifestyle is so hectic and he is so deceitful you wonder if he's enjoying all this. Adding to the tedium is considerable footage that doesn't further the plot. There are extended sections with no dialogue or French-only dialogue. We see documentaries of wars torture and troop training interspersed with the live action. When Robert's flight returns from Africa we wait and wait for the plane to land and taxi to the airport terminal. Annie Girardot is the standout performer in this film. Hers was the most interesting character and she played it to perfection. It was also nice to see Candice Bergen at the beginning of her career. I can't find fault with Yves Montand's performance of what was basically an amoral bum. I enjoyed some of Claude Lelouch's novel techniques. In a hotel room scene the camera pans around the room as Robert and his mistress argue. We catch sight of them briefly during each pass around the room. In another scene set on a sleeping car of a train Robert is lying on the upper bunk while his wife is on the lower. Robert is giving his wife some important but distressing news but we hear only parts of it because of the clatter of the train. I sensed that his wife was also unable to absorb every word due to the shocking nature of the news. I also liked the exciting safari scenes in Africa. The cinematography of those scenes and of those in Amsterdam was superb. I reviewed this movie as part of a project at the Library of Congress. I've named the project FIFTY: 50 Notable Films Forgotten Within 50 Years. As best I can determine this film like the other forty-nine I've identified has not been on video telecast or distributed in the U.S. since its original release. In my opinion it is worthy of being made available again. 
 This is the worst thing the TMNT franchise has ever spawned. I was a kid when this came out and I still thought it was deuce even though I liked the original cartoon. There's this one scene I remember when the mafia ape guy explains to his minions what rhetorical questions are. It's atrocious. Many fans hate on the series for including a female turtle but that didn't bother me. So much so that I didn't even remember her until I read about the show recently. All in all it's miserably forgettable. The only okay thing was the theme song. Guilty pleasure they call it... Nananana ninja... 
 I am partly a fan of Miyazaki's work. I say partly because most of his films fall into two categories: brilliant and boring. Sadly this film falls into the later category. This film suffers from the same fundamental problems as Miyazaki's recent film Howl's Moving Castle . An intriguing premise is set up but then immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some unfathomable events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than explain it. The first third of the film reveals the post-apocalyptic world the story is set in and actually looks like an very interesting story is about to unfold. From then on things go down hill. The middle part of the film is mostly made up of thinly-veiled eco-propaganda and the ending is heavily marred by the reliance on the kind of impenetrable spiritualism which ruins a large number of Japanese animated films. Overall the film feels as though someone ripped out every other page from the script before passing it on the the animators. What is left is something which is visually stunning (although sadly the version I saw was an Nth-generation copy with poor colour - which gives rise to the common myth that Nausicaa shows her bare bottom when flying) but which makes little sense and ultimately left me confused. 
 There was a reasonably good looking girl starring the film(Zoe Mclellan) but even her looks couldn't stop me from voting it the lowest possible - one. The plot is bad and irrational. What more can I say. The movie sucks. 
 This film has a weak plot weak characterization and really weak special effects that I question why I lost valuable life by watching it. It has random characters who add nothing to the story and seem like excuses for the director to get his girlfriend in the film. The robots are sad and the main hero 'bot is turned on by a huge knife switch. If this movie weren't so bad it would be laughable but there's nothing funny about it. The main antagonist is one of the only redeeming characters and he is killed. It's sad when you root for the bad guy because he's the best one to cheer for. When all is said and done this movie was better left on the cutting room floor or never funded at all. 
 Some illegal so-called asylum seeker comes to Stuttgart and finds that Germans are racist. This is just another already-forgotten steaming nugget in a long list of post-WWII anti-German propaganda films aimed to make Germans feel bad for not welcoming each and every degenerate in their country so he can chase German blonds and sell drugs to German teenagers. If you're looking for good German films in General see Der Tunnel Der Untergang Europa Europa and Lola rennt. But not this. Also Das Experiment with the same male actor from Lola rennt.  
 Im not surprised that even cowgirls get the blues if this movie is anything to go by. I expected something better from Uma Thurman which was the reason I suffered my way through this experience in the first place. An awful film with only the music as a redeeming quality. Its just a shame that we are incapable of giving 0 out of 10 in these reviews. This movie deserves it. 
 An obvious b-grade effort to cash in on the Hostel/Saw buzz my expectations for this film were low (really low!) and yet it still managed to disappoint on every level. The acting is so bad it's not even funny the plot-line is non-existent and the only scare was realizing that I had wasted 1hour 21 minutes watching it! I'm surprised to note that 34 people gave it a 10 star rating. I can only suspect that 33 of these are Cast and Crew. The 34th is possibly the directors mother? - although I'm sure even she would find it hard to go higher than a 2! DVD extras include an hour long making of feature. Which raises the question Why? (although perhaps it serves to demonstrate what not to do!). Avoid at all costs. 
 When I was at the movie store the other day I passed up Blonde and Blonder but something about it just seemed like it could possibly be a cute movie. Who knows? I mean I'm sure most people bashed Romy and Michelle before they saw it Blonde and Blonder might have just been another secret treasure that was passed up. But when I started watching it: Executive Producer Pamela Anderson wow I knew I was in for something scary. Not only that but both of what were considered the pinnacle of hotness: Pam Anderson and Denise Richards not to offend them but they were not aging well at all and they're playing roles that I think were more meant for women who are supposed to be in their 20's not their 40's. The story was just plain bad and obnoxious. Dee and Dawn are your beyond stupid stereotypical blonde's they really don't have a clue when it comes to what is going on in the world it's just really sad. But when the girls are somehow mistaken for murder assassins the cops are on their tale and are actually calling the girls geniuses due to their ignorance is bliss attitudes. They are set up to make a hit on a guy and they think they're just going to show him a good time but the real assassin is ticked and wants the case and to kill the girls. Denise and Pam just look very awkward on the screen and almost like they read the script the day before. I know that this was supposed to be the stupid comedy but it was more than stupid it went onto obnoxious and was just unnecessary. Would I ever recommend this? Not in a million years the girls are just at this point trying to maintain their status as sex kittens it's more a sign of desperation and Blonde and Blonder is a huge blonde BOMBshell. 1/10 
 Man this movie sucked big time! I didn't even manage to see the hole thing (my girlfriend did though). Really bad acting computer animations so bad you just laugh (woman to werewolf) strange clips the list goes on and on. Don't know if its just me or does this movie remind you of a porn movie? And I don't mean all the naked ladys... It's something about the light or something... This could maybee become a classic just because of the bad acting and all the naked women but not because it's an original movie white a nice plot twist. My final words are: Don't see it! It's not worth the time. If you wanna see it because the nakedness there's lots of better ones to see! 
 That might be a bit harsh for me saying that but sadly so far in his directing career its true. Just have a look at what he as done so far. They barely make it past the 3 star mark. Why did I watch this movie? 2 reasons. Lucy Lawless and Heroes star Greg Grunberg. Lucy was outstanding in this movie her performance carries the whole movie. I do hope she gets a blockbuster and breaks into the bigger league of actors she clearly has the skills. Greg was not so impressive typical TV acting style. The movie is oddly categorized as a horror. The only horror is short flashbacks and they last a max of 2-5 seconds with a little blood in them. I personally would call this more a drama/thriller . But no matter how interesting the story actually is bad directing editing and acting (appart from Lucy) destroys it. You get no real connection to the actors something which is very important in a story like this one. You just sit there watching feeling nothing. Its like watching a bad TV soap....actually I think the TV soap would be more interesting. My advice: Stay away from this movie...or better yet just stay away from anything Michael Hurst is involved with. 
 Disney? What happened? I really wish the movie had been set in the 60's ;like the book was. And I really could have dealt with cheap special effects in order to save the budget for a more accurate adaption..... I'm glad that maybe someone might be influenced to read the books..... but The Man With Red Eyes interchangeable as IT? And what's up with the volcanic upheaval? Where was THAT in the book? Peter Jackson! Save us!!!! A long time ago (1978) I heard that there was European version of this film. I sure wish I could id it. I can only imagine it might be closer to the real story than this poor adaption. This movie needs to be X'd. 
 Not even Timothy Hutton or David Duchovny could save this dead fish of a film. For starters the script was definitely written to be made into a B-film but somehow Duchovny (looking for a star vehicle to elevate himself out of television) and Hutton (looking for the two of a one-two punch he had hoped would define his career after Ordinary People ) became attached to the picture. Cheesy lines big bad wipes from scene to scene (Come on--who uses wipes after 12th Grade Telecommunications class?) and plain old bad acting sink this film. Even Duchovny is not immune to the bad acting plague that is this film. Only Timothy Hutton rises above the material at all. I must admit feeling Duchovny's pain as he read the lines that are the voice-over. While I found myself laughing when I'm sure the director wanted me to feel terrified nothing prepared me for the closing line of Duchonvey's voice-over: if you ever need a doctor be sure to call 911. If only the studio had called 911 this dog of a motion picture would never have been made. Avoid at all costs. 
 this movie only gets a second star because i work downtown and liked seeing it destroyed. the effects were pretty good- i hear it was the most expensive Korean film ever made. being the most expensive and still absolutely horrid makes it a massive waste of money. i rented it so i won't complain too much about what i paid but it was a couple hours that i'll never get back. plot holes abound. terrible acting all across the board. i do not recommend giving up the time to watch this movie life is too short. if your friends want to watch this run away. i can't stress enough how bad this film was. where the hell did the second dragon come from? why didn't he show up sooner? how did they have rocket launchers on dinosaurs just 500 years ago? 
 had some lovely poetic bits but is really just an artsy-fartsy toss-together with no direction or resolution. how do these people get through film school? who gives them money to make this crap? could have been so much more fine lead actor and i always like Fairuza Balk but come on the alt-rock metaphor of just staring vacantly unable to find anything compelling is just so tired and it sure doesn't make for good films. the director needs to go away and live life for a good long while and not come back to the camera until they really have something to say. this is like the throw-spaghetti-at-the-wall school of art-making just juxtapose a bunch of earnest imagery and hope hope hope like hell that poetry emerges. that can work if the director actually has any kind of vision or has a brain that knows when it's in the presence of potential but here it's just space filler of no consequence. i felt the lazy ending coming moments before it hit and was yelling you lazy bastard at the screen when the credits popped up. 
 Whoever wrote the script for this movie does not deserve to work in Hollywood at all (not even live there) and those actors need to find another job. The most dreadful hour and some minutes of my life... and I only kept watching to see if it would get better which unfortunately for me it did not. Even at the end the credits gave me anxiety. I guess there weren't a lot of people behind the movie so they had to roll the credits slowly... very slowly. This movie is definitely a great How Not To Make a Movie guide. Too bad I can't give a 0. 
 Okay so someone somewhere a few years ago thought it would be a good idea to make a 3D IMAX movie about some flies stowing away aboard the Apollo 11 and going to the moon. So they did. Someone somewhere was an idiot. I want to give the artists props for doing their homework on the hardware. As far as I can tell the rockets and the launch hardware were bang on. The graphics in general were pretty good - the rocket launch gave me chills like a good rocket launch always does (my Popular Mechanics flying-car gearhead blood still runs strong) and the 3D was pretty effective. The CG wasn't Pixar-quality but it was generally good. The flies were kinda mediocre anthropomorphics with some half-assed late-60s characters thrown in for colour (hippie flies African-American flies with giant afros and black shades etc.) and the maggots looked more like grubs with human baby heads (although they made suitably gross squelching noises). The scriptwriters certainly did not do their homework relying on offensive and outdated clichs (60s gender politics including mostly-useless female characters racial stereotypes evil Russians a fat fly who only wants to eat grade-two level gross-out humour). In a movie aimed for IMAX they blew a wonderful opportunity to sneak in some educational content about physics and space travel - they didn't get their physics right (zero-g in the Lunar Module during landing burn? PLEASE.) They couldn't even be bothered to read the original radio transcripts between Houston and the astronauts all of which is in the public domain; instead they wrote their own dialogue which sounds like crap. But we liked the maggots. So they get a point and a half for rockets and maggots. Uh yay. 1.5/5. 
 i know you've read that before on countless other films no doubt if you're reading the comments here but voodoo academy still stands as the absolute worst film i've been able to track down. no doubt the really bad ones aren't even available to buy or watch on tv but even so i feel it's fair to qualify that i'm not just some dumb renter who picked badly. i've seen two thirds of the bottom 100 ranked films here on the imdb and i'm ticking of the remaining ones with every chance. most of those stand head and shoulders above this... excersize in absolute monotony. i like to rate truly bad films (as in ones with no humour even in how bad they are) by how many people you need to watch it with to make it all the way through. if you can watch it by yourself it isn't that bad. if you can watch it with one single friend... it's bad but could be a lot worse. it took 5 of us to make it all the way through voodoo academy. and not even the usually fun moments of watching bad films (spotting the boom mic for example 3 times in this one if i'm not mistaken) could take away the dry taste in my mouth. yes i'd watched it but i'd also forced 4 of my friends to watch it with me to achieve that end. i hope and pray we saw the directors cut... to think that there could be a version with 20 more minutes of big eyebrowed lugs with baby oil glands rubbing their torsos just scares the hell out of me. so much of the film centers around this. i do applaud david decoteau for managing to lens this film in two days on a short budget just as i applaud him for convincing people to pay him to make what is no doubt a celluloid version of some of his fetishes. but it isn't a good film. the original shop of horrors was shot in the same length of time for a comparitive amount of money (considering inflation) and was an utter gem. it's not an excuse for how bad this baby is. spoilers ahead... it's not even worth picking apart the plot holes or cliched know it all hero characters... the pacing of the film... is insane... nothing... is interesting for the length of time decoteau dedicates to the pectoral self massaging. no matter what your alignment or sex... rubbing just cannot sustain that kind of screen time. the acting is cheese... but not overly amatuer... i've seen a lot worse in better films... but somehow it's the semi competent delivery of some of the worst lines you'll ever hear in a film that really grates. rent this if like me you have a fascination with the worst of the worst and only if you're going to watch it with a group of people who are prepared to work to get through it. this is no ha ha ha the set wobbled affair. it's an endurance test you probably want to skip. i'm sure there is worse... but i wouldn't be surprised if it has decoteau's name on it. 
 with a title like this you know not to expect a great horror movie. But this was really bad even with low expectations. The plot is really insulting and stupid: an escaped criminal wears a Halloween mask so everyone around him thinks he's someone else. this joke might actually work for 5 or 10 minutes but not during the entire movie ! the actors are not that bad but their characters are rather dumb and the story is boring and downright stupid. No suspense no excitement and little gore (very cheap). Satan's Little Helper tries to combine horror (...) with comedy and fails dramatically at that. It became so boring towards the end that I actually stopped watching 10 minutes before the end. I couldn't care whatever happened. Amanda Plummer was great in Pulp Fiction but come on.. that was 13 years ago and she hasn't done anything decent after that. So no wonder that she had to sink as low as this piece of crap.. Avoid or be warned.. 
 After spotting the high rating on IMDb I decided to go see this movie. Beyond that high rating I intentionally avoided reading any of the reviews. I wanted to go into the theater with a clean slate without knowing the plot or having predetermined expectations. Given my rating you can see that I was disappointed. I enjoyed the development of the main character Mike Enslin. I also enjoyed how the hotel manager attempted to talk him out of entering the hotel room. By the time Enslin entered the room I was ready for some scary stuff. First chocolates appear on the pillow and the toilet paper is folded. Enslin reacts in a believable manner. He's freaked out. I'm encouraged and think to myself this is going to be good. The people who made this movie understand that less is more. But it's what happens next that was a big let down. The subtleness is quickly replaced by the predictable shotgun approach... Just blast the audience with every Hollywood scary trick in the book and hope that something works. Let's see a clock radio that turns on by itself? Good that's always scary. Objects that move around in the room? Good you can't complain about that. Blood dripping from the walls and sink? Great. Ghosts that commit suicide? Good. Anything else? How about loud noises shaking fire more shaking messing up the room more blood etc etc. It's all good. And it's all been done before. Overstimulate our Attention Deficit Disordered audience with all kinds of stuff in quick succession and they won't be able to look away. Well it didn't work for me. And you know what else? When I go see a horror movie in a theater it's typical to hear several groups of girls in the audience yelling in fear at scary moments. But this movie had no scary moments. The audience was silent and disinterested. I felt no chill down my spine. Nothing. The Shining was 100x what this movie tries to be. So who are all these people who are saying that it is one of the best horror movies ever? Friends of the director? Sorry I just don't get it. 
 The two things are are good about this film are it's two unknown celebrities. First Daphne Zuniga in her first appearance in a film young and supple with looks that still encompass her body today steals the very beginning which is all she is in and that is that. She is obviously just starting out because her acting improved with her next projects. Second the score by then known composer Christopher(Chris) Young is what keeps this stinker from getting a one star...yeah I know one star more is not much but in this movie's case it is a lot. The rest is just stupid senseless horror of a couple a college students who try to clean out a dorm that is due for being torn down getting offed one by one by an unsuspecting killer blah blah blah...we all know where this is going. Watch the first eighteen minutes with Daphne Zuniga then turn it off. 
 I think everyone was quite disappointed with this sci-fi flick. For one thing it was directed by Tim Burton. Another thing it's a remake of what is supposed to be a classic. I found it boring gross and ridiculous. If you've seen it you know what I mean. Just about everyone at Imdb say it's crap and boy are they right! If you haven't avoid it. It's a snorer. 1 out of 10. 
 I've seen better teenage werewolf movies in my time this one however takes the cake. More comedy than horror Full Moon High puts the c in cheese-fest. The star quality in this movie is not bad. Just the way it was made just sends in rolling downhill. Adam Arkin plays Tony an all-American high school football player of the 50's who ends up not aging due to a werewolf bite in Transylvania. The most annoying part of the movie was the violin player. He drove everyone batty! Ed McMahon plays his ultra-conservative father who met his end of his own bullet. Adam's father Alan plays a shrink who seems to be not top of his game. After all these years Tony seems to be very out of place due to the attack and then he'll get the chance to catch in his state. More laugh than blood shed this movie is just a start in the 80's Teen Wolf was an improvement from this! 1 out of 5 stars. 
 This film deals with two ex-football players who are Fred Williamson (Mack Derringer) and Gary Busey (Lenny) who work as private eyes and meet all kinds of ladies and men with some bad backgrounds. Mack Derringer is approached by his ex-wife Vanity (Jennifer Derringer) who works at having sex talk over the telephone. Jennifer is being threatened by one caller who wants to do horrible things to her and she asks for his help along with several other ladies. Mack & Lenny have more time on their hands and often go to Miami Fl. golf courses or hang out in a Sports Bar where all kinds of city things go on. There is lots of punches killings and plenty of double meaning words that bring this film completely down to a big ZERO. Don't waste your time this film cost me only 50 cents and that was too much. 
 Where to begin? How best to describe just how awful this movie is??? Let's start with the campy hick humor. It isn't very funny. Add a bunch of musicians impersonating actors - Meat Loaf is horrible and Deborah Harry is even worse. Pity poor Art Carney who should have known better than to do this movie. And then there is the plot. A roadie whose life goal is to work an Alice Cooper show meets a girl whose life goal is to be a groupie for Alice Cooper. At least they get what they want... And then just when the movie should end they can't come up with a more plausible last scene than a - well I won't ruin it for you if you really want to see the movie. There are certain actors that let you know that this is going to be a B movie or perhaps worse. Gailard Sartain is one of them for me - and he has a more prominent role. That's a sure sign that the movie probably won't be very good. If nothing else the movie lives up to the low expectations - even exceeds them by being worse than poor. Let's just say this. This is the movie against which all bad movies are compared. And none are worse than Roadie. 
 Depending entirely on your own personal state of mind when watching this Christmas Evil can either turn out to become an ambitious and innovative psychological thriller OR one of the most pathetic and infuriatingly lame holiday-themed slashers ever made. Me personally I'm tempted to opt for the latter because I didn't bother to do any research at all and simply anticipated a cheesy and undemanding early 80's slasher with a nutcase in a Santa Clause costume butchering people. Wrong! The movie actually handles about a bloke named Harry Stadling; who's obsessed with Christmas works in a rubbish toy factory and considers it to be his responsibility to determine on Christmas Eve who deserves presents and who deserves punishment. Harry's issues all started when he witnessed Santa ? his daddy in a costume obviously ? caress his mommy's naked legs at a tenderly young age. After that he just developed into a social outcast much to the irritation of his younger brother who's bound to snap one (holi)day. I fully understand why certain fans appreciate this slightly eccentric horror movie but did it really have to be so boring? There are several overlong and seemingly endless parts of the film in which absolutely nothing happens. I can forgive the shortness of gore and outrageous bloodshed but this movie doesn't even benefice from an unsettling atmosphere or unexpectedly demented plot twists (with the notable exception of the finale I must admit). Also I would have taken the concept more seriously if the crazed protagonist would focus himself on lethally punishing the naughty children! He doesn't and exclusively kills misbehaving adults. How are you supposed to take wannabe controversial and original Christmas thriller serious when Santa doesn't even commit one miserable child murder? THAT would have made Christmas Evil a classic whereas now it's just a forgettable and pitiable piece of junk. 
 The acting other reviews notwithstanding was remarkably well-done. Brad Pitt handles the role of an annoying obnoxious Austrian climber quite well. Other acting is fine. The story could have been riveting but somehow it misses - one never really understands or cares for the characters shown and so the story which could have been quite dramatic fails to draw in this audience. Beautiful scenery and cinematography a remarkably dramatic true story important events that shaped the world that we live in - but I could not try as I might involve myself in this story. As an unabashed Brad Pitt fan (I consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation) I expected to *love* this flick - and yet it left me cold. It could be a failing within myself but I tend to point toward the creative end of this movie - direction scriptwriting production editing - somehow they lost me. It's a shame because it could have been wonderful. Good acting dramatic story beautifully shot - it should have been magnificent. It wasn't. Probably worth watching just to make your own mind up on it - but don't expect too much and perhaps you won't be as disappointed as I was. Mostly it bored me. 
 Times are tough for Angel Town gangs rule with an iron fist and for reasons mostly unknown (Mainly due to embarrassing writing) the gangs want a street kid Martine to join the gangs so they beat him up everyday. However due to the presence of an Olympic kick-boxer (Olivier World's lamest actor Gruner) named Jacques hope is on the way. Angel Town is seriously one of the most inept message movies ever made (And I've seen my share) it seems to consist of the idea that all gang infested neighborhoods need are French kick-boxers who can't act. Worst of all there are so many awkward moments it's just truly hilarious. Best of all comes from the exchange between Gruner and Aragon which basically sums up how ridiculous this thing is. To Wit: You like the fighting? (Olivier grabs his Asian best friend in a headlock) I could kill him right? When I want him dead he dies! The reason why I don't want him dead is because i'm afraid of him and I know that if I kill him his son and wife will kill me that's why he doesn't die! Of course the fact that it's wrong to kill someone let alone your best friend is of course left out of the equation. Odd. However don't let me make this sound that I hated this movie far from it it's so terrible it's priceless. The biggest laughs come at the end in the disastrous finale which sees Grunner going one on one with gang-members who (the film's biggest logic gap)decline the use of pistols. Also a handicapped Vietnam vet helps out by shooting his machine gun at the gangs while Gruner kick-boxes the rest. All of this set to the sound of horrible Mexican accents and surreal energy that make this one memorable for fans of cinematic trash such as this. The other treat about this movie is that for some reason Olivier Gruner never attends college despite that's the main reason he's here in the states and not in France getting it on with his girlfriend (In a graveyard in the film's awkward beginning) Angel Town is without a doubt a failure on all conceivable levels but if you laugh at moronic martial arts movies with insane levels of action that make no sense on any level this is the perfect movie for you. On the other hand make sure to down tequila like the laughable opening song details Ain't no mercy in Angel Town * out of 4-(Bad) 
 I just watched The Incredible Melting Man for the second time and it was even more boring than when I first watched it. I don't understand why it has become such a 'cult classic' when it is so tediously dull. The opening scene looks promising when the fat nurse drops the canister of blood and runs for her dear life. After this all that really happens is the melting man stalks around some woods and houses whilst having flashbacks of his life as an astronaut. The makeup is quite good and his melting gooey face looks fairly realistic. There is a cool scene where he throws a mans head in a river and it floats until it reaches a waterfall where it falls on rocks and bursts open. There's not much to wet yourself over though most scenes are shot in darkness and you can't really see what is happening. There isn't much gore at least in the Vipco DVD I watched. No The Incredible Melting Man is not that great at all. I'll give it marks for its cheese factor but that's about it. If you want a TRUE sci-fi/horror cult classic watch The Deadly Spawn instead! 
 The cult of personality has elevated the status of Roger Corman Sam Arkoff Lloyd Kaufman etc. as kings of the B's. Because the folks at Crown International were so key they haven't been elevated to the status they richly deserve. A film like THE VAN may now seem like a disposable piece of Drive-in esoteria but it was a sizable hit when it was released (not to mention subsequent re-releases as a double feature with other Crown hits). THE VAN was a perfect example of Crown's hit strategy of seizing upon the mood of movie-goers at the time of a film's release. Here it was sex drugs rock 'n roll and the brief Custom Van fad. As others have noted it is ironic that the hit song in the film refers to a Chevy when the title vehicle is a Dodge in the film itself. I had a town Selectman where I was at the time even declare these vans to be dens of sin on wheels! A perfect ad line for the film! There are the usual assortment of good and bad girls muscle-heads and low-brow hijinks (including a supporting bit by Danny DeVito). In many ways this isn't much different from the old Beach Party movies of the 60's but now spiced up with Nudity and Drug use. Obviously done on a limited budget and a limited schedule the film coasts along pleasantly enough with a breezy charm that compensates for some by today's standards certainly un-PC views of women. The classic touch is a Toaster for Bobby's den of sin on wheels. Yes a Toaster! Hey you gotta have something hot for those munchies! Grindhouse Fest. 
 Let me start by stating that I usually do like Renny Harlin's directing style for the most part and that the cinematographer should be commended for some the shots. Unlike Harlin's Elm Street 4 and Die Hard 2 which I really liked there is something that is missing from this movie. That my friends is a script. The dialogue in movies like this is always pretty awful but this one takes the gold medal for stupidity. There are so many awful lines in this movie I don't even want to have to remember any of them. Not just that but the execution of the lines is pathetic and seems more suited toward a bad porn movie than an action adventure. It's almost like Harlin thought that if they slowed down the words being said they could improve the script. Wrong again. The sad part is that there is some talented actors thrown into bad roles with worse dialogue. Stallone has never been a favorite of mine but when he is acting circles around Lithgow Turner and the worst of the bunch Rooker there is something wrong with this picture. Lithgow played one of the best villains in Ricochet yet comes across as someone who can't act to save his life here. How is that possible? I've always been a huge fan of his and he gets schooled in acting by Stallone who himself still phoned-in his performance. Turner's part is so small and pointless but she still manages to appear lost on screen. Michael Rooker CAN act. I know this because I have witnessed it in Days of Thunder but he seems like he is READING his lines from cue cards. Has it come to this? When Rooker and Lithgow have scenes together where they are speaking I just wanted the movie to end right there or have them both amazingly find their acting ability. Unfortunately neither of those things occurred. Which brings me back to Harlin who can be the only one to really blame for this mess other than the screenwriters. It's his fault that I was never drawn into this movie at all because he should have made the people actually act. The script is not very good but still the actors' performances are what destroys this movie and that has to lie with the director. I don't care how much was paid for the special effects which for the most part are good you still can't just sacrifice the movie with terrible acting. Plus the pacing of this movie seems to be off. The opening sequence was good and the plane scene was very well done but how are you supposed to care about the outcome of the heist at all. I mean I understand that they were trying to create tension with all of the bells and whistles of the plane scene but I really didn't care if they got the money or not in that scene. If the bad guy's would have won early maybe I wouldn't have had to witness one of the worst movies ever! 
 Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal are already preparing a sequel about a young US corporal in Afghanistan. He also happens to be a highly-qualified surgeon and is roaming freely around Kabul operating on wounded NATO soldiers. On a particularly difficult mission he casually picks up a sniper rifle and shoots Osama Bin Laden from a distance of about 3000 yards. He is then finally promoted to sergeant but is unable to decide between a sniper and surgeon career so he quits from the Army altogether. One year later frustrated with civilian life he joins the Navy and the last scene shows him proudly wearing a white uniform. 
 I watched this movie with some friends a couple months ago I still laugh today thinking about some of the utter stupidity. The first few scenes alone were hilarious. I won't spoil anything for those who wish to see it I wouldn't want to ruin the laughs. Needless to say the entire time I watched this movie I was trying to figure out exactly what the point of anything the characters in this movie were doing. Towards the end we all got bored however as the initial hilarity and shock of a movie being this random wore off. There is no plot and not a trace of decent acting. The characters are about as well developed as those in a kindergarten Learn to Read book. They even managed to make a lesbian sex scene uninteresting. 
 I noticed that this film has taken the brunt of a lot of insults. It probably earned some of them but it wasn't that bad. Well I'll be honest: I never want to see this film again. It was a bad film. But I don't hate this film it tried to tell a story. As a drama this film could work very well actually. I just think the filmmakers misgauged which road to take when they made this (they should have added more funny bits if they wanted it to be a comedy). With a rewrite it could have been a great film. But as a satire it didn't work in its current form -- many scenes did not fit within the context of the plot: for example the robbery scene makes little sense in the story. Still it wasn't the worst independent film ever made -- is it in the Top 10 Worst? That's debatable. 
 Only reason I have seen 101 Dalmatians was its nominations for original song and costume design for the Oscars. I must admit that I was less than impressed with this film. In this sequel Cruella DeVil(by the way Glen Close pulls off this role very well) is released from the hospital due to her good behaviour. She likes all sort of animals and locks all her furs away. From that point we only wait until she starts having crises. Soon enough she does and tries to make the best coat of fashion world of course for herself and from fine Dalmatian fur. Apart from Glen Close I found all cast quite silly but from a child's eye funny. That is fair enough as its target market is I assume children under 12. Quite a good entertainment for children and families but didn't do much for me. * out of ***** 
 Ascension is actually a step up in terms of what the original movie was in story and in special effects. Jason Scott Lee Is good as a vampire hunter looking for the count himself (if you remember him he was from the movie Dragon The Bruce Lee Story.') Jason London is funny as Luke the kid who helps the woman he loves from a far steal Dracula's body from the slab. Diane Neal Is good as the woman who steals Dracula's body in order to finds a cure for her dying boyfriend And Stephen Billington is great as Dracula himself. Giving a better performance than Gerard Butler did the count in the original film. Roy Scheider rounds out the rest of the cast in this movie and he does a decent job as the mentor of Jason Scott Lee's character. This is the second sequel in the trilogy and they are off to a good start. It's up in the air whether the last film will close the series out on a good note. 
 The motion picture was in all likelihood made in the year 1930 and released in 1931. I would surmise that talking motion pictures had great difficulty in making the transition from the silent era. Nevertheless this particular Zane Grey plot appears to be very weak. Also Gary Cooper was probably just learning to act. The result is something that would not be acceptable by today's standards. For 1931 maybe. For 2004 not acceptable. Some of the actors performed well. Sadly the Indians always get the short end in these early westerns. They were living on the land long before the white man came but according to twisted history they had no right to defend themselves. 
 OK i own this DVD i got it new at amazon... i mean i think its badass and a pretty cool flick and melissa bale the slutty/bitchy girl they pick up is hot as hell ... the acting sucks and the whole polt just sucks the clown is some huge guy wearing a mask and its disgusting but its OK i wouldn't recommend it if like u wanted to rent a good entertaining flick after a hard days work but if u have nothing else to do and ur obbsessed with this stupid movies like i am watch it sometime and i do not know how artisan DVD has S.I.C.K. in its DVD collection s.i.c.k. is not good enough to be owned by a half way decent movie company OK well thats all 
 Another double noir on one disc from Warner Home Video and by far the better of the two movies is RKO's marvellous 1950 thriller Where Danger Loves . This is a memorable classic with a great cast in Robert Mitchum Faith Domergue and Claude Rains. Crisply photographed in Black & White by Nicholas Musuraca it was tightly directed by John Farrow. Where Danger Lives is a prime example of the noir style of picture making and will always be remembered for its stylish craftsmanship that was Hollywood's past - (See my full review). Unfortunately none of the above praise can be applied to the second movie on the disc the abysmal MGM 1949 stinker TENSION! Poorly written (Allen Rivkin) and directed by John Berry this movie is full of ludicrous characterisations and unlikely situations. The inconceivable relationship between a mild mannered and wimpish pharmacist - blandly played by Richard Baseheart - and his overtly floozy wife (a risible Audrey Totter) is totally implausible and unconvincing (how on earth they ever got together in the first place is anybody's guess). Then when she unsurprisingly ditches him for one of her playmates (Lloyd Gough) our timid pharmacist instead of being euphoric and over the moon with his new found good fortune plots revenge and attempts to kill Gough but at the last minute chickens out. The guy gets murdered anyway and our pharmacist is immediately suspected by Homicide detective Barry Sullivan (another bland performance). So who did kill him? Well at this stage of the movie you really couldn't care less since it is all so badly executed and rendered ridiculous by director Berry. Mr. Berry has no idea of pacing and is unable to inject even a smidgen of style into the thing. There is nothing he can put in front of the camera that will prevent you from nodding off! The only TENSION contained in this movie is in the rubber band that is stretched to its limit and snaps in the fingers of Barry Sullivan as he gives the intro at the film's opening. So much for that! A most unfortunate effort! C'est La Vie! Best things about this turkey is the smooth Monochrome Cinematography by the great Harry Stradling an effective score by a young Andre Previn and an early dramatic appearance by the lovely Cyd Charisse before she found her dancing shoes. Hey! - maybe she could have saved the picture had she given us a few steps and a couple of pirouettes! HUH? In its favour however are the heaps of extras that are included which boasts trailers commentaries and featurettes for both films. But the disc is worth it alone for the RKO Mitchum classic! 
 ... You can't exactly shove her out of the way because she's old; and if you were being charitable you might say that the ponderous gait she ambles along with isn't really her fault. Nevertheless in these circumstances it's often difficult not to become irritated when you find yourself dragging your heels in her wake. So it is with The Pallbearer an attempt to do something 'different' with a romantic comedy that in this way is chiefly hamstrung because the venue is all wrong; sort of like showing off your 'breakdancing' skills at a grandparent's funeral. To further extend the metaphor (perhaps unwisely!); like the old lady one starts to feel with the set-up of the film that its demise cannot be far away. Sure enough this particular 'death' is agonizingly protracted slowly chipping away at our reserves of empathy in tiny little increments as depressingly we come to the realisation that the proceedings are only headed in one direction: Downhill. Its laboured attempts at 'humour' can be seen coming a mile off - again not unlike the grim inevitability of death! Returning once again to the image of 'dragging heels' the main character Tom is shown to ceaselessly repeat this action throughout his life. If there are indeed degrees of 'pathetic' then this sap is possibly a good few notches ahead of Schwimmer's other - more famous - role. To find oneself in the awkward position of having to align audience sympathies with a character even MORE 'clueless' than Ross is certainly a tough ask even for as 'able' a comic performer as Schwimmer but I guess he can find fault with himself for signing on to some seriously 'echoing' situations in the first place. How will he ever escape his most famous portrayal if he's picking scripts where the characters could almost be 'interchangeable' even if the situations aren't? A man with a longstanding high-school crush on someone he hasn't seen for years. Sound familiar... ? Paltrow is nothing else if not bland in her 'Rachel' role but all of this going over old ground would perhaps be forgivable if the noticeable DIFFERENCES present weren't so incongruous as well. Unfortunately the romantic element is so well-worn it's threadbare and the 'backdrop' is so inappropriate that it seems the best way to describe the resultant film is as something of a 'stiff'... ! 2/10. 
 Nu Image UFO and others produce films for the SCI FI channel that come in with budgets of roughly $2 million. Some feature extensive effects work others feature recognizable casts and still others feature both -- for $2 million. Mr. Hines initially claimed that this film was budgeted at $20 million dollars but it's painfully obvious that this was probably produced for $750 000 if not considerably less than that. Few sets are utilized a number of scenes are shot against green screen and most effects seem incomplete and amateurish. It's painful to watch. Not so much because it is poorly directed poorly executed and misguided but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for quite some time and had high hopes for this film despite its relatively modest budget. Those of us who believed in this movie when it was originally announced have joined the legions of those spoken of by P.T. Barnum. 
 (this may be a bit on the spoilerish side) I would like to start by saying I did not watch the entire movie nor could I because it was evident from the first hour that I was going to be incredibly disappointed. That of course is the problem with taking what many believe to be an amazing book and turning it into a Disney Made-for-TV movie. A Wrinkle in Time should have been made into an amazing movie a long time ago. It's got a great storyline that could hook children and adults. Plus it's got built in quality sequels. But Disney-fying was not the way to go. The problem with the movie is that all the things they changed to turn it into a visual story dumbed down what was so great about the book. It is a complicated and emotional story for kids. There was no reason to make Charles Wallace purely psychic because that was the easiest way of explaining it. There was no reason to write a fight between the three Mrs. W's as added tension there is enough tension in the story without that. There was no reason to remove Meg's glasses... that deprived us of what could've been a very sweet scene between Calvin and Meg that happens in the book. I could nitpick for days about little things but I also think larger things like the art direction was a off. Take for instance the way they made Camazotz look with its strangely darkened skies. The creepiness that comes across in the book is that Camazotz could be Earth. It looks like earth. It has people on it that look like humans. The skies are blue the grass is green and there are children playing. But something is a little bit off. The directors chose to make Camazotz a complete other instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the movie. The lesson of course is that Camazotz could very well be Earth that is if we forget how to love. It would've been much creepier to have a beautiful afternoon as they're walking down the street with the kids bouncing the balls in the same rhythm. I unfortunately did not watch the end. Maybe someone can tell me how Disney messed up the end as well. Overall an artistic disappointment. 
 Cash (Now played by Khrystyne Haje in for Angelina Jolie) has wandered to a post apocalypse wasteland (after her protector has died from old age said protector was played by Elias Koteas an actual decent actor) and now she finds that people wander through the rubble looking for cyborgs to trade for scrap metal and cash. She leads a group of burned out cyborgs (That includes William Katt Evan Lurie and a human scientist played by Zach Galligan) against bounty hunter Richard Lynch. Malcolm McDowell has two minutes of screen time as Lynch's employer. Cyborg 3 does manage to be better than the other two entries but it still is a largely dull feature. The problem this time is that the ideas with potential are never used well the action sequences are routine and the name cast such as McDowell Katt and Galligan are given little to do. Haje is indeed a whiny heroine and Lynch is too over the top(as usual) and the film lacks the inspiration or ambition to be as fun-bad as it's hilarious predecessor. (The one with Van Damme the second one is just dull.) Also disappointing is the science fiction angle which almost aggressively resists any good idea it has. As an action flick this is routine and by the numbers B-movie stuff and it is competently made that's the only thing positive I can say about it. *1/2 out of 4-(Poor) 
 Tarzan the Ape Man is a remake of the 1932 film of the same time and like that earlier film it has little resemblance to Burroughs' literary character. But while the 1932 Tarzan was reduced to Tarzan - Jane speech this Tarzan played by Miles O'Keeffe doesn't speak or even grunt. He does do the the Tarzan yell a couple of times which sounds like it was sampled from the earlier film. No Tarzan plays second banana to Bo Derek as Jane. Or rather as third banana to Bo Derek's left breast and her right breast. This movie has no point but to show Derek naked. The two action scenes in the film are presented in slow motion and are really bad. More evidence that no one cared. Bizarrely enough Tarzan has an orangutan side kick in this film. Maybe he car pooled in from Sumatra with the Indian elephants that are also on display. 
 This crew-versus-monsta has been done a hundred times sometimes better. This one was pretty slow-moving ; only the monster's resurrection was really worthwhile. Attempts at character developments gets botched by routine. Yeah routine is the word. Went straight to video in France. No wonder

 And how it made it into production astounds me. The main character is an obnoxious show off who isn't the least bit funny. I can't stand the character at all. He's a dumb ass with nothing to offer the show. This is the worst cartoon to surface in the last 10 years no joke. The story lines are both poorly written and executed. The jokes are as bad as the ones on Disney's Sweet Life of Zack and Cody. I could not dislike this show more it's terrible and should be canceled. Even the theme song is bad. The title even worse. It's as though this show is written by a couple of 15 year olds that based the character on themselves and think they're hot stuff when they're really just arrogant and lack creativity as well as humor. Johnny Test go away far and fast! 
 Unbelievably bad acting a no good unclear story and flashy images and slow-motions where they are needed the least: Adrenaline is everything a movie should not be. Georgina Verbaan (a so-and-so dutch soap actress who hasn't attended her English classes) plays rich girl Freya who has the habit of 'thrill-seeking'. Which basicly is doing dangerous stunts break stuff and annoy people. And not in a fun Jackass way. Then there's Dracko (Rivas). He kinda leads the bunch but has other illegal activities on the side. Then there's Freya's dad (Lockyer) who plays a dubious role as well. And in the end we got Jason (debutant Fyall) the boyfriend of Freya. One day Freya gets disappeared and everybody seems involved but we the viewer really don't care as nobody of the cast is either likable or believable and the story doesn't make any sense. Why was this even made? 2/10. 
 Let me be really clear about this movie. I didn't watch this movie because of the plot I watch it for the saucy sex scenes. That being said this movie is so god damn awful I flip between pure joy of seeing a godly body of Traci (Mandy Schaffer) and cringing my eyeballs out for the disaster of a plot. Spoiler Alert The first scene of the movie already had me cringing.. you see a woman painting something by the lakeside in pure bliss and serene then a beautiful girl approach and ask if she could paint beside her. When they both finished they show each other what they had done... and the woman painted A VINEYARD WHEN SHE IS FACING INFRONT OF THE LAKE. What kind of screwball director would make this kind of mistake?? And in another scene Traci gets to kill her teacher's lover by smash him with the sail pole and then she swims away and none of the town's police suspected her once. I mean HELLOOOOO? MANDY DID NOT WEAR A GLOVE DID SHE? HER FINGER PRINTS ARE ALL OVER THE GOD DAMN BOAT!! After that it gets worst whenever Mandy is around there is the chilling sound effect played which sounds like a cat in hissy fit. It's also a real pity Rosanna Arquette's is in this movie. I feel real sorry for her to have to star in this super low budget soft-porn no brainer. Same goes for Jrgen Prochnow who also has the misfortune to star in this movie. All in all 2/10. 
 I saw this film when it first came out in 1978 when I was a sophomore in high school. I took a date to see it. I didn't get any needless to say because the film was so bad! Joan Rivers' career never tanked as badly as it deserved after making this awful unfunny crap. In fact unfunny isn't a severe enough term: this film is ANTI-FUNNY! You walk out feeling like any laughter that might have occurred was beaten out of you before it could happen. This isn't worth watching out of curiosity or out of any sense of it being so-bad-it's-good. Not even the gang at MST3K could've made this worth watching! The fact that Billy Crystal's career survived this early suicide attempt is a miracle. 
 Believe me I wanted to like Spirit . The idiotic comments people made at the time of its release about how quaint it was to see old-fashioned hand-drawn animation again as if the last pencil-animated cartoon had been released twenty years ago and the even more idiotic comments about how computers had now made the old techniques obsolete had got my blood up ... but then the insulting flavourless banality I had to endure in the first ten minutes of Spirit got my blood up even more. The character designs are generic the animation (partly as a result) merely competent the art direction as a whole so utterly boringly lacklustre that you wonder how it could have come about (we know from The Prince of Egypt and The Road to El-Dorado that there are talented artists at Dreamworks) and the sophisticated use of CGI is in every single instance ill-judged. (Why do they bother?) There's not a single thing worth LOOKING at. In an animated cartoon this is fatal. But it gets worse... The horses can't talk but they're far more anthropomorphised and unconvincing than the deer in Bambi which can. And it seems that in a way the horses CAN talk. Spirit himself delivers the prologue (sounding for all the world like a 21st-Century actor picked out of a shopping mall in California) and from then on his laid-back decidedly unhorselike narration is scarcely absent from the soundtrack although it never once tells us anything that we didn't already know or expresses a feeling which the artwork poor though it is wasn't capable of expressing twice as well. That prologue by the way: (a) contains information which Spirit we later discover had know way of knowing; (b) expresses ideas which Spirit would lack the power to express even if he COULD talk; (c) includes new age rubbish like This story may not be true but it's what I remember ; and (d) will give countless children (the production is pitched I presume at six-year-olds) the impression that horses are native to North America which is sort of true in that the common ancestor of domestic horses zebras etc. WAS native to North America - but all horse species on the continent had gone extinct long before the first humans arrived and the mustangs of Spirit's herd (which allegedly belong here like the buffalo grass ) were descended from horses introduced by Europeans. So the prologue rather annoyed me. As often as Spirit talks Bryan Adams sings sounding as usual as though he's got a bad throat infection - and it's not THAT he sings or even HOW he sings it's WHAT he sings: maudlin narrative ballads which contribute even less if possible than Spirit's spoken narrative and which sound as though they all have exactly the same tune (although I was paying close attention and was able to discern that they probably didn't). If only Bryan Adams and the guy-pretending-to-be-a-horse could have SHUT UP for a minute or two the movie might have been allowed to take its true form: mediocre and derivative rather than jaw-droppingly bad. 
 As it is often the case the impressive and explosive trailers of Asian films add up to nothing more than lackluster stories. Similar to Unleashed (which was great ) Dog Bite Dog tells a story where men are raised as ferocious savage dogs that carry out their master's bidding. The main characters an emotionally undeveloped amoral killer who is matched against an equally unstable police officer are far from the common heroes and villains we often see. In fact by the end you lose track of who you're supposed to empathize with failing to feel even the slightest emotion for either of the men ? whether that was the failure of the director or perhaps the underlining message he was trying to tell is up to you to decide. Although the beginning of the film was filled with intrigue and unpredictability by the half-way point it slopped down to a humdrum story of survival and revenge. The suspense which was evident at first soon disappeared because of a grossly mismatched music score which brought down the potentially effective story telling. And in the end you were left feeling that all that detailed background information and introspection of the main characters was somehow very unnecessary. On the plus side the transition in story from point a to point b was quite atypical compared to US movies ? so those who aren't familiar with Asian films and are tired of Hollywood's predictability should check it out. The white balance seemed off throughout most of the film. It was like looking into a picture shot on fluorescent when it was supposed to be set on tungsten. Maybe I'm the only one but it strained my eyes. The movie also enjoyed playing tricks on you ? an interesting build-up gave me hope for the slow moving story until it was diverted to a low budget low speed chase scene. And just when you think you were going to get an unanswered indie ending with a mix of Shakespearean tragedy you realize that it's not an ending at all but rather a transition into a wacky country-music montage about peace and serenity. Throw in some grisly from-behind choke scenes a moment of redemption unexpectedly brought back into savagery and back again the other way Asians' fascination with bodily fluids and a horrible music score that didn't match the film and you get the average bland Asian thriller. I just don't get why every fight scene was overlaid with clips of roaring lions ?I thought they were supposed to symbolize dogs? Ultimately in the end we are reminded about a true killer that still lurks amongst us ? tetanus. 4/10 
 This movie really i mean REALLY sucks. Its got plot holes so big and 30 foot dragon can fit through them. Not to mention the dragon itself which is inevitably the worst computer generated image ever to be put on the film real. I mean when you see something like this you gotta be thinking Wow someone actually made this movie. Then released it. That takes guts . Whoever they are i'm sure they don't work in the film business anymore. When i hired this movie it wasn't in on DVD so i (reluctantly) took it out on video. The first thing to appear was a Lord of the Rings trailer for the Two Towers. This was a very clever move putting this trailer on the video. It justifies me (reluctantly) giving the film 1 star otherwise i would have given it zero stars. Maybe the producers though the star attraction of Dean Cain (I think thats how you spell it) would draw in the crowds (uh to the video store that is). Next they employed split screen technique (like in Hulk) to (i assume) compensate for what an atrocity this piece of crap film is. On the box cover we see a picture of our hero and the dragon. Does the dragon look exactly like the one in Dragonheart or is it just me? Either way the dragon in the film looks like a reject from Gremlins 2 and has the CGI of a Nintendo video game villain from the early 90's (perhaps worse). Also not the Dragons movement as it pursues its victims- its the same F##cking monotonous movement- right leg left leg right leg left leg- dom dom dom dom DOM DOM F#$king DOOOOOM! This just pisses me off. Maybe the filmmakers thought this was thrilling and would have the same effect of Jaws. Why not then have a Dragon POV shot. Either way that was just funny much like watching a Weebl toon. Dean Cain gives many puzzled looks during the film (maybe his coming to terms with the fact that this film could end his career). Don't expect Superman here. The first time i saw the trailer for this film i thought it was an add for a PS2 game. As for the story its so so bad my 5 year old brother can come up with better ones when he's unconvincingly trying to lie about why he was messing around in my room while i wasn't there. Oh and did i mention that I F@#KING HATE THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS INCREDIBLY STUPID STUPID CRAP ATROCIOUS FILM?!!! 
 This film is one giant pant load. Paul Schrader is utterly lost in his own bad screenplay. And his directing is about as comatose as it can be without his actually having been sleepwalking during the process. The worst though is Woody Harrelson whom I ordinarily like when he's properly cast. He plays the walker a homosexual man in D.C. who plays social companion to the bored wives of the Washington elite. He couldn't have been more one dimensional if he had been cut out of a magazine and bounced around in front of the camera on a popsicle stick. His southern accent is that off the rack version that decrescendos from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers as though the heat and humidity of the South is still draining him of every ounce of energy he has. It is monotonous. But his is not the worst accent in the movie. His boyfriend played by Moritz Bleibtreau attempts to affect some kind of a Mid East accent that is so clumsy he can barely deliver the bad lines written for him. He is incapable of rolling his r's in spite of the fact that in real life he is German and speaks several languages - one of them being Italian! That's kind of a good reason to cast someone else don't ya think? From the story to the screenplay to the directing to the camera work to the performances by the leads this movie is bad from beginning to end. The only tolerable moments in this film came from three supporting actresses: Lily Tomlin Lauren Bacall and Kristin Scott Thomas. Only these three managed to make it through this movie with their dignity in tact. In fact all three are excellent in spite of being trapped in a really bad film. Ufortunately no one could ever be good enough to redeem this endless series of flaws. If you like these three actresses watch them in something else. This movie is not worth your time. 
 Even for the cocaine laced 1980's this is a pathetic. I don't understand why someone would want to waste celluloid time effort money and audience brain cells to make such drivel. If your going to make a comedy make it funny. If you want to film trash like this keep it to yourself. If you're going to release it as a joke like this: DON'T!!! I mean it was a joke right? Someone please tell me this was a joke. please. 
 We see a body of dead girl in a morgue with the coroner trying to close the eyes of the girl but whatever he tries they won't stay open. After this we move into the future and we follow a group of former school friends who hide a terrible secret but suddenly they start getting picked off one by one in many grisly ways. Through flashbacks we learn of this awful suicide of a shy girl who was trying to be one of the group but she was shut out by them because they dug up her past and found out some weird occurrences. So is she back from the grave seeking revenge? Oh what a great and always spooky story! Well that's what I hoping I could say. And 'hoping' was as good as it got. This is an forgettable so-so supernatural horror flick that I actually watched before but I went in thinking it was my first viewing. So to my surprise it hit me when I started picking up on certain things but like I said it's quite a forgettable mix that it felt like a first viewing again. Nightmare' is just another type of it's field that adds a 'few' changes to the gruel. Oh please give me something that's a bit more fresh. It doesn't have to be entirely original but this is one formulaic and at times quite tired J-horror flick. Even though it strings along the usual ghost story involving you guessed right? an evil looking vengeful chick spirit. But in spite of my negativity of it being the same old same old story and jolts. This one kind of entertains when its being grisly and popping in some creepy visuals. The deaths are vividly displayed with bite and some originality. While the gloomy atmosphere alienates the audience with it's murky lighting. The first scene involving the spirit terrorising one of the girls is one blood-curdling experience but really when it's not trying to shock you. I found it rather coma inducing and I thought about getting some shut-eye. That might be harsh but it just didn't go anywhere of any interest between those shock moments. You could say that because the supposed mystery is really not much of one the unsure story is just simply flat and the characters are a self-centred bunch that you don't really care what happens to them. The disjointed story should have focused more on the spirit than that of these bland characters who have one unconvincing group relationship. It just overplayed its cards by becoming overly muddled and taking too long to get going that when it comes to the climax it's just plain ludicrous. The film's haunting ending is a high point though. The film looks fine although it could have done without the snazzy quick fire editing and the music score was a bit overbearing in playing up the mood. The performances tread a fine line but Gyu-ri Kim is strong in the lead role. It's nothing new and it shamelessly steals ideas but if you can look past that it delivers some nasty thrills. Although I found the handling of it rather lethargic despite the odd effective chills. A standard effort all round I guess but still it's equally missable. 
 Another case of a decent DVD case betraying the shot-on-video quality of the film. It wasn't that bad. Rochon does a serviceable job and Damn! the cast is good looking. I've never seen that many musclebound guys hang out together on a regular basis. This movie really wanted to make you think Rochon was the killer but it was not to be. My biggest problem with the film was that by the end I didn't much care who was the killer and the real killer made little sense since it was out of the blue and the filmmakers were thinking 'ha betcha didn't see that one coming sucker!'. Yeah there were continuity errors about (mainly with ms. Rochon's ever-changing wardrobe) but for an indie slasher it's not that bad. I was pretty sure at the beginning it was just a thinly veiled excuse for girls to go topless but that was just a gimmick. The dialog was overly think and painful at times. Just don't have high expectations going into this and it won't be that bad. And Lloyd Kaufman's cameo is wonderfully understated. 
 I am amazed at the amount of praise that is heaped on this movie by other commentators. To me it was rather a disappointment especially the combination of historical facts fantasy and the main character's internal turmoil does not work at all (in Vonnegut's book Slaughterhouse Five and even in George Roy Hill's adaptation for the screen it does). Credibility is often overstretched. Too many questions are left open. Did I miss some central points? Or did I fail to spot the lines that supposedly connect the dots? A boy called Campbell Jr. grows up in upstate New York. At home his father has many technical trade papers and one book. It has photographs of heaps of dead bodies in it. The boy leafs through the book his dad doesn't like his doing that. What should this tell me? The family moves away from upstate New York to Berlin. BANG. It is 1938 the boy is a married man in Berlin and a theater playwright. What kind of plays does he write? In what language? Is he successful? His wife is an actress and looks glamorous. The parents move back to the USA and invite their son to do the same. He does not. Why? Because having grown up in Germany he feels more German than American? Because he is successful? Because his wife is? Because he likes his life there? Because he likes the Nazis? Because he is just plain lazy and doesn't like change? Don't ask me. Possibly the man just does not care is not interested in politics is a kind of an existentialist. He states that he is deeply in love with his wife. He speaks of his Republic of Two (meaning he and his wife). There is little to no evidence proving his love for his wife in the movie it much more seems a Republic of One. On the request of an American agent Campbell Jr. agrees to broadcast anti Semitic Nazi hate propaganda to American listeners as a device for transmitting encrypted messages to American authorities who read between the lines. The crucial meeting with the agent on a Berlin park bench is short unexciting and anti climactic the decision to play along comes pretty easily with no explanation the rise up to broadcaster seems to be uneventful and apparently fast. So now we have Campbell Jr. presenting himself over the air as the Last Free American. The scheme for transmitting secret messages is fairly realistic and exciting - although one wonders what happened when Campbell Jr. really and honestly had to cough hiccup etc. (must have scrambled the messages terribly). Anyway the Nazis lose the wife dies (touring in the Crimean for German troops - I never heard such tours really happened on German front lines in WW II) Campbell Jr. says he goes to the Russian front but does not go is captured by an American soldier who recognizes his mug (how come?) is dragged to a sight-seeing tour in Auschwitz is then released and resettled with the help of the Crucial Agent somewhere in the City of New York. AND THIS IS WHERE THE STORY REALLY STARTS BANG. From now on it is like a short story by Paul Auster. It is 1961 Campbell Jr. lives in New York tenement as a has-been and mourns the loss of his wife. Nobody really cares - or do they? Yes somehow they do and his neighbors offer some sort of distraction. Auschwitz survivors. A painter. Some American supremacists ?discover him and want him to be their figurehead. They even find his presumed dead wife for him or is she his wife? Anyway in the end Campbell Jr. calls in at the Israeli consulate and they obligingly give him the Big War Criminal treatment placing him in the cell adjacent to Adolf Eichmann's. He writes his life story and once this task finished hangs himself on the typewriter's ribbons without getting sooty the least bit. While I can see that there must be an issue of guilt and of loss I just had the impression that the main character is a person who at all times is pretty indifferent to everything and hardly capable of love for anyone. So I found it difficult to sympathize for this looser who mourns his loss. Amazingly many reviewers focus on his status as a potential war hero having put his reputation at stake for playing the Last Free American. I assume according to them this took a lot of courage. As a matter of fact however the movie suggests that by accepting the assignment Campbell created for himself a win-win situation as he would have been politically on the safe side no matter who had won the war. The danger of his being uncovered never comes up during the first part of the story. One might argue that the whole story is a dreamlike fantasy and that nobody should bother with historical accuracy or a logical development of the story which explains everything. But even then it fails to make a point primarily I suspect because the love affair in the Republic of Two falls completely flat. This is a pity especially if you consider that the wife was played by Sheryl Lee a talented versatile and sensuous actress. She has much too little screen time and is forced to use a ridiculous German accent. Another somehow neglected aspect are the different texts (confession broadcast and hidden messages) but I guess this is largely unfilmable. Maybe I should give the book a chance. 
 Did anyone read the script. This has to be some of the worst writing and directing of the entire year. Three great actors Paul Giamatti Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson couldn't pull this one out. About two-thirds it looked like Giamatti eyes were saying I can't believe I signed the contract. It's not the worst movie I ever saw but it's on the really really bad Christmas movie list. Not enough lines but what else can be said? Okay the movie just doesn't move with Vaughn's con-man dialogue his character is just a creepy guy that you just can't get past. It was just a lackluster walk through that no one seemed to be able to get into. 
 Kevin Spacey is very talented but unfortunately directing is not his forte. I had high expectations about the film before I rented it and maybe that is why I disliked it so much. I admire Spacey's attempt at making a film that takes place mostly in one small setting but it's not the attempt that counts. I found the film dull boring and stretched out. The acting was nothing spectacular. Gary Sinise has done much better especially since he is conscious in most of his other films. Skeet Ulrich was disappointing but this was one of his first films (I did get a kick out of how young and chubby this Scream star looked). The only thing that impressed me about this film was the one shot of the car wreck from above. The center line of the road was perfectly centered and the camera moved on along the line and past the wreck. However that shot was very Usual Suspects ish and my guess is Spacey got the idea from that earlier film of his (which is very good mind you). If you want to see a fabulous film that takes place in one small setting watch Hitchcock's Lifeboat. Maybe Spacey should have watched it before filming this. 
 How this film could miss so many of the fascinating complex and mysterious aspects of the original story or the original movie is truly remarkable. An unbelievably thin and unengaging plot ankle-deep characterisation/motivation and a really awful soundtrack (replacing tension with vast swathes of noise replacing the arcane musical references of the original for digitised crashes and roars. Then there are the specific references to the original which are merely plastered on over the cracks... Dreadful. In a world where gormless brain-dead Amerikan remakes of The Italian Job (a tear appears) Get Carter (sobs uncontrollably) and Alfie have desecrated our screens recently this one takes the proverbial biscuit. Execrable nonsense. How Ellen Burstyn ever got involved is a wonder... Rubbish. 
 I read a couple of good reviews on this board for Mr. Scarface but for anyone uninitiated in the genre of Italian gangster films like myself the picture will probably make very little sense. Indeed after the initial setup involving the ten million lira scam the picture devolved into a fairly routine revenge flick with a minor twist in the identity of Rick's (Al Cliver) character. The whole gang war plot got muddied up for me with the inclusion of Vinchenzo Napoli (Vittorio Caprioli) but as most other viewers commented he's about the only one who gave this picture any life with his often ineffective attempts at violence. I found it somewhat unbelievable that Manzari's goons who chased Tony through the streets didn't actually stroke out before Tony even laid a hand on them. For all of his buildup as the title character Jack Palance was wasted rather unceremoniously in an anticlimactic near finale making the U.S. working title Mr. Scarface rather moot. I've seen enough spaghetti Westerns to know that they don't all work; I guess in this case my first look at a spaghetti gangster flick didn't quite make it either. 
 The movie started off strong LL Cool J (Deed) as an undercover police officer with partner Sgt. Lazerov (Dylan McDermott from the Practice possibly miscast as a bad guy?) committing robbery and murder. Deed refuses to kill the drug dealer which sets up the conflict of a dirty cop with a conscience. The other big names (Freeman Spacey et al) are well cast and the movie shows promise. The movie begins to fall short as soon as Justin Timberlake (Pollack) is introduced. Given the opportunity to make a good movie that people will possibly see repeatedly or one that teenage girls will go and see the once because of Timberlake I would choose the former. Even talented actors have to work hard at their craft; Timberlake is NOT talented and no amount of hard work can save him. I would have thought he would put on a better show given the fact that he has been acting talented for years. Everything he did in this film was unconvincing. Just because a singer sells millions of records and sells out stadiums it does not automatically translate that they can act successfully in feature films. Even hardcore N'Sync fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of acting talent. That aside there are a few plot holes such as Pollack's sudden sniper ability and deadly operation of warehouse machinery. This movie had so much promise. Thoroughly disappointing. 
 La Furia del Hombre Lobo forms a completely stand-alone storyline which doesn't seem to fit in at all with the previous Waldemar Daninsky movies. Some have commented that this movie is supposed to take place before the events of Werewolf Shadow although it was released afterwards ... they may be right I'm not sure. Anyway in this movie Waldemar Daninsky is bitten by a yeti-like creature in Tibet (great dialogue here -- It was a yeti. But that's impossible. I'm a scientist and these things don't exist. It was a hallucination. That's all. ) and although marked with the sign of the pentagram he is able to prevent the change into a werewolf until he discovers that his wife has been cheating on him. Changing into the beast one night he kills both her and her lover before running out into a storm and being electrocuted. It's not long before he's resurrected by a dominatrix university professor who is conducting some kind of unfathomable experiments with mind control. He is taken to the underground cellar of a castle where the subjects of these experiments live like chained animals. First of all -- Jacinto Molina Paul Naschy whatever you want to call him he's a fine actor and cared passionately about his work. No matter how flawed these movies are you can always rely on him for a decent performance. The rest of the cast seem good enough but it's hard to tell when they have a half-assed voice-over dubbed over all their lines. And that was really the main problem for me ... many of the voice-over artists they used were just awful awful awful. Whenever I chuckled during the movie it was at the inept way that they delivered their lines (they seem to constantly refer to the hero as Waldeman ). But unfortunately it's almost impossible to find subtitled copies of Naschy movies although they're sometimes available in the original language without subtitles. The directing of Jose Maria Zabalza seems sort of hit-and-miss ... there are some great visual ideas in some scenes while others are badly constructed and poorly edited particularly in the final scenes when it really counts. The reason for this was that Zabalza was apparently drunk most of the time while on set. He allowed his fourteen year old nephew to rewrite Molina's dialogue used extras without his permission and spliced several shots from Molina's earlier movies. All of this pretty much ruined any chance this movie had of being one of Molina's best works and it's no surprise that the two of them never worked together again. But it's not all bad news as there are some good ideas here. Some aspects of the storyline make an interesting psychological drama with the werewolf as a metaphor for jealousy and rage. The 'werewolf as a yeti' idea is one that returned in Molina's later work. Some pretty horrific and surreal stuff goes on down in the cellar and there's also a very memorable sequence about half way through the film where Daninsky runs from house to house through a village slaughtering or molesting innocents as he goes -- one scene is particularly intense but it's actually lifted straight from Molina's first movie La Marca del Hombre-lobo along with a few other shots. I actually found the movie on the whole to be very entertaining although there are some problems with the Front Row Entertainment version such as pretty obvious cuts (although some of it may simply be due to the director's lack of continuity). Gods knows what omissions there are -- I'll probably try to get my hands on the uncut version at some stage in the future. This is a overall a decent piece of vintage Naschy which experienced fans might enjoy but it could have been much better and so probably wouldn't make a great introduction. 
 My interest in Dorothy Stratten caused me to purchase this video. Although it had great actors/actresses there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest. Plus it just wasn't that interesting. Dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable. I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here. 
 This film is not deserved of the next few minutes I will spend criticizing it but I know many people like myself rely on IMDb.com to assist in deciding on films. For that reason alone I am writing this. Live Feed is like an Asian version of 1976's The Incredible Torture Show (aka Blood Sucking Freaks ) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077247/. Torture dismemberment murder cannibalism... sure it's all here along with a third-grade script pathetic acting and a perverted failure of an attempt at black comedy. The film takes place in China yet everyone speaks English. There is an abundance of girls in the film who are horrified by the butchering of dogs in a marketplace yet are sexually excited about entering a porno parlor. One gal who is disgusted by the filth in a restroom stall moments later is still there having at it with her friends boyfriend (how he even got in there might be the only engaging thing about this whole film.) The film is absolutely awful even for a B-movie. Even if you were to download it for free it would be an insult to your hard drive. 
 usually I support independent art and i try to be very comprehensive and tolerant...i tend to support everybody because their efforts are worth... but this movie just moves away from all comprehension and tolerance limits! imagine the following situation: 1. think about the REALLY WORST horror movie you have ever seen in your life so far. 2. think about some great attractive ART for that movie's DVD box...and a promising plot... 3. voil! you got ZOMBIE NATION. see it only if you really don't have anything else better to do. ANYTHING is better. 
 I'm not a big fan of slasher flicks as a genre but even by the standards of low-low-budget exploitation this one is really lame. Even on a nudity-and-gore level it's incredibly boring (there is some of both but it's all sort of...meh). Before the home video revolution it might not even have been released theatrically (though it might have; after all *Plan 9 From Outer Space* played in theaters). There is precisely one good (and competently-delivered) line in the entire movie; I assume they stole it from somewhere. The acting is among the worst I have ever seen. I mean even Ed Wood had a couple of competent actors and the rest tended to be ludicrously hammy which can be fun to watch. Anyway most of his actors could pretty much pass as literate. Here those who don't read their lines like cigar-store Indians sound like they learned them phonetically. And this film does have one distinction: it manages to be badly underplotted for most of the movie then laughably overplotted for the ending. (Update: I should have singled out the actress playing the receptionist as an exception. She is by no means wooden. Not that she's good but she certainly isn't wooden.) Even the worst slasher flicks are generally good for a few Puritan meditations on their grotesque offensiveness but with this one there doesn't even seem to be anything there to work up a moral outrage about. And you know the funniest thing? They clearly expected to make a sequel! It's so bad and boring that it actually becomes fascinating in a weird way. I sat enrapt through much of the video wondering why anyone would go to the bother of making it. 
 2002's undeservedly popular I Love the 80's is an inane idiotic offensive and downright disgusting pop-culture mess of a show that was the first in a long-line of horrid television programming that ultimately spelled out the end of VH1 which was at one time the only real music-oriented channel left on TV! I used to practically live on VH1 up until the spring or winter I forget which one now of 2002 when garbage like this started to appear for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Out of sheer morbid curiosity (I'd guess that's what you'd call it) I had decided that I would go ahead and give it a look-see anyhow the first night it came on even though the advertisements looked like complete crap. At least I can honestly say that I wasn't a bit disappointed by it because my expectations were obviously bottom basement-level to begin with. The emphasis of this show I found out within the first 5 minutes was less on each year of the 1980's and what was and wasn't culturally significant or popular (which is what I was expecting to see) but instead more of an impromptu platform for a whole slew of really god-awful no-name comedians to display what they more than likely think is their comedic skills *rolls eyes*...more like lack-thereof if you ask me! It's pretty easy now to see why no one had ever heard of any of these idiots before they appeared on this show because they are all so terribly unfunny and pathetic in their attempts at so-called humor that I swear I could feel my intestines knot up with each and every rancid one-liner they shot off one after another! Altogether I have no problem in saying that I Love the 80's was/is trash of the lowest denominator and one of the main reasons why I almost never watch VH1 anymore. 
 Let me being by saying the I followed watching this video by watching Saw and after Bleed Saw looked like the all time greatest horror flick ever even though I thought it was only fairly good. Bleed is pretty bad. The best part is seeing the female cast nude. The gore is very fake looking and over-done. It has its funny parts but its extremely predictable and I didn't want to stay to see the horrible ending. If I could I would ban these actors and actresses the only reason being is that Debbie Rochon (Maddy) has been in over a hundred other videos and I've also seen two other members of the cast in equally or worse motion pictures. They should not allowed to continue this madness. 
 There are a couple of prior comments here which opine about this flick's abundance of clichs throughout -- and I agree completely both with regard to the characters AND the dialog. I'd read about Elizabeth Berkly's awful performance in the equally-awful Showgirls which I've never seen - and her performance here while not awful is barely up to the standards of Lifetime's worse fare. There was not a hint of depth to her character but then there probably shouldn't have been. If so it would have placed the film completely out-of-balance since there wasn't a hint of depth or charisma - not a trace - in any one character performer or portrayal. The principal's handling of Liz's initial complaint after her tutee had kissed her in the hall was laughable. Her husband's initial reaction and advice were likewise (Forrest Gump attacking Jenny's boyfriend in his car provided a more realistic intelligent action and hell he was mentally-challenged). The smarmy unctuous lawyer (excuse the redundancy) father of the lying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in his performance: he was both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time no mean feat. Her attorney was more of an insensitive nerd also not unknown in the profession. Finally (and frankly I rather enjoyed this part) the police were such a collection of insensitive oafs that you'd rather depend upon Barney Fife without Andy to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community. I know that most real-like cops fall a bit short of the sharpness intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by most characters on the Law and Order series' and the like -- but dolts of this level seem to be a staple on Lifetime. Finally I found a kind of story within a story fascination with Josh's concoction of his being the victim of his teacher. This scripted performance within the story was even worse than his overall performance in the main story. This was something of an achievement like going from F to F-minus. This whole lame situation should have been resolved - in real life - in about 15 minutes following a realistic meeting between teacher and school authorities with husband involved. But then that would have precluded the contrived drama following and left an hour's blank film in the camera. But the writer(s) here proved with their ending they could do even worse. When the situation was finally resolved and righted this was accomplished in all of about 45 seconds with no indication of what measures might have been forthcoming in any real world context for the perpetrator and his parents or whether they might have been able to find some sort of path toward redemption. This one's a 2* presentation; the second * because it does have some mild fascination.  
 I can't believe that this movie even made it to video and that video rental stores are willing to put it on their shelves. I literary asked for a refund. Take away the fact that the movie has no historical truth it and it is still the worse movie ever found in a video store. It is not even good enough to be called a B rated movie. Do not waste your money or your time on this movie. Just listing to the voice over and the horrible music made me sick. Anyone involved with this movie should be pulled from the union gives the industry a black mark but after watching most of this movie I really don't think anyone involved is a union member. 
 Dreadful acting. A thinly veiled attempt to slam those on the left side of the aisle. Women are subjugated and revolve around men. Tom Selleck shows his acting range from A to B. 
 The only good thing about this unfunny dreck is that I didn't have to pay for it. I saw it for free at college. And if a college student can't find humor in something that was free it's hopeless. Stale acting and poor jokes cannot be masked by an excellent yet bewildering set design (that goes out of its way to market Volkswagon Beetles). I don't know what Michaels Myers was doing in this movie but I have never seen anything more depressing. This was nothing more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the previous success of the Grinch (which has its opponents but I enjoyed it very much). It's difficult not to sit through this failure and wonder what better projects were passed over to fund it. You want a funny Seuss adaptation? Go with the Grinch. 
 It seems like this is the only film that John Saxon ever directed and that he had the good sense to stop after that and stay in front of the camera. This movie is a dog from start to finish and it's dull and wooden with nothing much going for it. A Viet Nam war hero takes a job working for a mob boss gets a bit too friendly with the wife and then the wife is killed by the mob boss himself & the war hero framed and sent to prison death row specifically. Now this particular prison has been experimenting on inmates and is testing some formula that will turn men into the ultimate killing machine (a zombie). Of course everything goes wrong and then there's all these infected people trapped in the prison some of whom are turning into zombies and the rest who suddenly just don't want to be there anymore. This just goes on and on and on with nothing particularly much to show or say for itself and I stopped it before the end which seemed like it was coming a few times but no it was apparently only getting set to take off on a different and equally dull path. If one watched to the end they may well become a zombie themselves so don't risk it. 2 out of 10. 
 Not one of the better pokemon movies. Two legendary pokemon come into the story. You do get to see how strong Celebi can be though he turns evil first. Suicune also makes an appearance he didn't seem that powerful. The Marauder didn't have many strong pokemon at all except for that taranitar? Some fight scenes with his pokemon may have made it better. Ash and Pikachu meet the much younger Professor Oak though they don't realise it. Misty I was thinking had it at the end but she didn't get close. I saw this in the credits. Don't expect much here the worst of the series so far. 
 This film is so much of a rip-off of the masterpeice demons and thats the only thing that makes the movie worth watching. The acting is terrible the action scenes are speeded up the script is almost painful and budget non existent. If you think this film is good then you havn't seen a real horror film skip this and get a copy of the movie demons. 
 as an inspiring director myself this movie was exciting to watch with criticism in mind. Shot with low end digital camera probably with 35mm adapter for DOF. The editing is good acting decent sound effects aren't too over the top. I would have give it a 7 for an indie film but the story aren't that interesting. It's more on the drama side character developments than a horror flick. It's not for those who wants to get spooked startled frightened grossed out or sit down with popcorn to just enjoy. honestly this movie would be good if we were still in the 50's This movie is about a family who has a dry field and that is just that. 
 One of my sisters friends lent me this game and it is too damn hard! It carries the appearance of a kids game but you have to learn how to do tons of intricate moves that require you to twist and turn your hands into all sorts of awkward positions and you have to search seemingly endless levels for 100 notes to improve your 'score'! You also have to find these impossibly hidden jigsaw puzzle pieces that require you to do almost impossible tasks to get them! AND I AM ONLY UP TO STAGE THREE!!!!! Maybe if you have no life nad can stay home all the time you might get some enjoyment out of this but otherwise keep away! AND IT IS DEFINATELY NOT RECOMMENDED FOR KIDS - THEY WILL PULL THEIR HAIR OUT WITHIN THE HOUR! 
 David Arquette is a young and naive home security alarm salesman taken under the wing of Stanley Tucci. Arquette is a golden boy scoring a big sale on his first call- to widow Kate Capshaw and her dopey son Ryan Reynolds. Things are going well for Arquette he is appearing in commercials for the security firm and he is falling in love with Capshaw. Then Tucci and his right hand woman Mary McCormack let him in on a little secret- they sometimes break into the houses of their clients in order to scare them and to get their neighbors to buy security systems from the firm. Arquette decides not to get involved taking Capshaw to meet his family and going through life with a goofy smile on his face. Then someone breaks into Capshaw's home and murders her and her son. Arquette suspects Tucci and sets a series of traps resulting in a gun to his boss' head as Tucci pleads his innocence. Based on a stage play The Alarmist is not opened up well. The scenes where Arquette takes the Capshaw to meet his parents are badly played and completely unfunny. They are also out of line with the character Capshaw is playing as she gets drunk and tells sexually explicit stories to Arquette's mom Michael Learned. Other than these scenes Capshaw is not given much to do but she does a lot with the little she is given. Stanley Tucci looking just like Terry O'Quinn is a riot as the security firm owner. He is a creep who really does not understand Arquette's moral revulsion. However when he turns into a sniveling whiner after Arquette kidnaps him he is hilarious. Mary McCormack seems to have been groomed for a bigger role but she mostly stands around and agrees with Tucci. Ryan Reynolds is too old to play a dumb teenager but he is funny especially telling his own explicit sexual story to Arquette. The screenplay lurches from romantic comedy to dark comedy too soon. Capshaw meeting the parents is completely unmotivated except to give her a reason to get out of town so someone can break into her house. Capshaw and Reynolds are in the film just to give Arquette a reason to take revenge on Tucci. Arquette who has proven he is a good actor is awful here. He relies on the constipated mugging that got him through those AT&T ads and he is not a strong enough presence to build this weak film around. Actually Reynolds might have been a better choice in the role. Dunsky's direction is good nothing that will win an Oscar soon. Christophe Beck's light jazzy score recalls the type of film noir this film tries to be and it is really catchy on top of that. Despite the pluses Arquette's failure as a lead and the script's schizophrenic quality sinks the film. I do not recommend it. This is rated (R) for physical violence gun violence some gore strong profanity brief female nudity sexual content strong sexual references and adult situations. 
 This is a truly awful film. What they have done is taken a TV show which was never aimed at young children & given it the George Lucas treatment (i.e. ruined it by kiddifying it to appeal to the younger audience). OK so the Thunderbirds TV show wasn't exactly the most cerebral of shows in fact it was pretty formulaic but it was always enjoyable to watch (especially when the models got blown up) and the voice cast wasn't too bad. This suffers from bad casting & bad acting (with the notable exceptions of Sophia Myles as Lady Penelope & Ron Cook as Parker who seem to be the only cast members to have a clue about how their characters should be played) & after this travesty I wouldn't let Frakes direct traffic. The whole point of Thunderbirds was that it was about the whole Tracy family & how they worked as a team preventing disasters or coming to the rescue of those involved in disasters. Avoid this rubbish like the plague. I only give it 1 out of 10 because a zero rating is not supported. 
 There's a major difference between releasing an original intense edge-of-your-seat scary gore-fest and doing like filmmaker Eli Roth and his team have done with Cabin Fever and simply acted like it. The film follows five college graduates into a cabin in the woods that begins to prove fatal as one after the other succumbs to this mysterious fast-acting flesh-eating disease. It's not long before the friends turn on one another and can barely stand the sight of one another much less want to be in the same vicinity as them. As gross as it all sounds there's a certain spark behind the basic premise of this film that could have worked in the hands of a less cocky filmmaker. Unfortunately what we end up with is poorly drawn characters whose sole purpose seems to be to look beautiful at the beginning to make the inevitable decomposition more contrasting a hackneyed script so profanity-laden as to leave the viewer tuning out the dialogue and several incomprehensible subplots that motivate little more than (in one instance) an on-screen appearance by director Roth. This is sloppy film-making in several ways! Avoid this time devourer. 
 I still don't know why I forced myself to sit through the whole thing. This film wasn't worth the Memorex DVD-R it was burned on; I thought I was watching the end result of a group of middle schoolers stealing their parents' camcorder. This is by far the worst movie ever made. I truly from the bottom of my heart want to sue Aaron Yamasato for the two hours he stole from my life. So apparently it's supposed to be bad on purpose; However if you should end up in Hell and are forced to watch this 90-minute coil of doo-doo you'll see that Yamasato is really trying hard to make an awesome flick. The actors attempt dramatic kick-ass performances comparable to Crimson Tide but come closer to The Marine. The crap acting is just the tip of the iceberg. The camera angles are awful. The story is C-movie at best-- the plot isn't even good enough to be considered B-movie caliber. The dialogue attempts to be dynamic and witty but is crap like everything else. Rumor has it that a hard copy of the screenplay actually attracts flies. Plus the techno score is annoying... not because it's techno but because it's NON-STOP. That's right the music plays in the background THE WHOLE TIME acting as a subliminal reminder of how bad this thing is. I don't care what the disclaimer claims I don't buy it. BOTS was not made this bad on purpose because it takes itself WAY too serious for what it was: a joke. This film was very low-budget. But that is no excuse for its record-setting suck factor. Great films are born of substance not budget. BOTS had neither. Allow me to further articulate the overwhelming power of this 90-minute waste of time: if I were having a three-way with Jessica Alba and Jessica Biel in front of a TV and Blood of the Samurai came on I'd be out of there quicker than Steven Seagal in Executive Decision. Undoubtedly some people will try to defend the movie. Two maybe three. They'll say it's grindhouse chop-socky! or cheesy in a good way! or it's so bad it's good! Those people are idiots. A movie is either good or it's bad. There's no such thing as a good bad movie. But there ARE such things as idiots that like crappy movies. Don't get me wrong; there are lots of cornball not-to-be-taken-seriously movies out there that are enjoyable and entertaining. Slither is one. BOTS is not. This suckfest runs about an hour and a half and in my humble opinion it's 90 minutes too long. The best thing about this film is the DVD cover so next time you're near the Wal-Mart DVD bargain bin take a look at it-- DON'T TOUCH IT just look-- and quietly walk away. 
 I will start this off by saying I couldn't get all the way through it. I picked it up on a rainy day from WalMart like the rest of the reviewers on this site. I figured there wasn't any way I would regret my purchase. Was I wrong or what? Seriously now who approved this project? They need to be forced to watch this movie over and over until the end of eternity. That's the only fitting punishment I can think of for releasing something this bad. The shooting reminds me of the movies I used to make for class projects on a big old VHS cam. The acting isnt much better. I think the only difference is that there are a few cool cameos. Yay who cares... Shecky Moskowitz is unfunny and the ships comedian is an even bigger loser. That's about as much of the plot as I understood. Overall it's the worst movie I've ever seen. I own it on DVD and have given it to many co-workers to watch. Each comes back and laughs and says Wow I didnt think I'd ever say I shut off an Adam Sandler movie 15 minutes in.... My response is always Well now you can  
 Thanks to this film I now can answer the question What is the worst movie you have ever seen? I can't even think of a close second and I've seen some really bad movies. Absolutely nothing works in this film. Name a single element of any horror film and this movie fails. Honestly I've seen better on YouTube. Here's some typical dialogue: Steve? Steve? Steve is that you? Steve I'm not kidding Steve this isn't funny! Steve are you there? Steve? Steve? Steve? ARggh!!!! Ahhhhhh!!!! Nooooooo!  
 Yet another venture into the realm of the teen-gross-out-comedy set on a college campus featuring a nerd's quest to coolness and how he decides to blackmail a trio of popular jocks into making him get the girl. It's all been done before and it's all been done in a far more satisfying manner. The gross-out humor that has made teen flicks like American Pie and Dude! Where's my Car so popular is taken completely out of context in this installment appearing so completely at random that the viewer can only frown and disapprove. The film is badly written and the actors never succeed in making any of it even slightly bearable. I won't even dignify this terrible picture by divulging as it's a waste of my time and yours. At best Slackers never manages to entertain or induce laughter and at worst it is excruciatingly bad and at times completely unwatchable. Jason Schwarzman who impressed in his debut Rushmore humiliates himself by appearing in this picture and one wonders how a career can end up in the toilet so fast. Please avoid please avoid. Save your money. 
 I have to confess that I am severely disappointed. This version can in no way compete with the version of 1995. The reason why I watched it was that I wasn't entirely happy with Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth and thought that Rupert Penry-Jones looked much more like the Captain I had imagined when I read the book. And he was too. Unfortunately that is the only redeeming quality of the film. The rest is as un-Austen-like as possible. Miss Elliot would NEVER have run through the streets of Bath like this. It wasn't in her character and it just wasn't done by a lady of the those times. The Anne Elliot of the book was a lady and she had dignity. There are other painful anachronisms but this was the worst. Although there are 3 important quotes from the book they are at entirely inappropriate moments warning those who know the book that yet another important part of the book will either be missing or completely changed. And although this version is not much shorter than the other one it feels like everything is rushed. Very little care was taken to introduce the characters show their dispositions and motives. Important scenes were omitted. How could they possibly have butchered the final scenes in this way ? A disaster ! And it was by far not as beautifully photographed as the other one. No no no. If you love Austen then don't waste your time with this. 
 Notorious for more than a quarter century (and often banned) it's obscurity was its greatest asset it seems. Hey it's often better to be talked about rather than actually seen when you can't back the legend up with substance. The film has played in Los Angeles a couple of times recently and is available on home video so that veil is slowly being lifted. While there is still plenty to offend the masses it is more likely to bore them than arouse much real passion. Except for a gratuitous and protracted XXX sex scene between a pair of horses ( Nature Documentary anyone?) there follows nearly an hour of a dull arranged marriage melodrama. Once the sex and nudity begins it is a nonstop sequence involving masturbation a looooooooong flashback to an alleged 'beauty and the beast' encounter and a naked woman running around the mansion (nobody even her supposedly protective Aunt seems to even think of putting some clothes on her!). On video I guess you can fast-forward thru the banality but it's not really worth the effort. The nudity doesn't go beyond what is seen in something much more substantive such as Bertolucci's THE DREAMERS. Try as one might to find some 'moral' or 'symbolism' in the carnality I doubt it's worthy of anyone's effort. Unfortunately for LA BETE now that you can more easily see the film the notoriety of something once 'forbidden' has been lifted. And this beast has been tamed. 
 I saw this movie the first time at about twelve o'clock on a Saturday evening. It really is the perfect time for this one. I have never EVER seen a movie that was actually more predictable and drenched with stereotypes. If you want to see a thrilling action movie don't watch it because you might lose the will to live halfway through. However if you want a good laugh please watch it! I even bought the Chuck Norris 3DVD collection thanks to my enjoyable Saturday night. What especially struck me is that very scene that would be expensive to make was copy-pasted from a Discovery documentary or an old TV-special on the US Army. Furthermore I was amazed by the fact that they didn't put the slightest effort in making the production look real. Afghanistan is as far as I can remember nowhere near any sea and yet with a single click Deke escapes from the terrorists sand-castle with his jet-pack and is taken away by a submarine (probably Discovery). Later on in the movie Deke throws an Islam terrorist against the wall. In the slow motion scene you can beautifully see the long hairs of the Korean stuntman flap in the air when smashed against the wall. Gotta love it. I recommend you watch it with some friends and a good amount of beer though only then you'll understand why I've been mad enough to spend 6 99 euro's on the box. 
 I totally hated the movie. It was so retarded. They need to get some acting lessons....no wait that won't help because the Naked Brothers Band people a retards. You know why I am here even though I am a Naked Brothers Band hater? To warn people before they watch the dumb movie so that the NBB doesn't get any money from it so then they can't make any more amateur stupid songs that are so retarded that any old guy could go and write it in 10 seconds. Not only are the song lyrics retarded they sing badly. Okay I'm kinda getting off the movie here.....anyways it was boring and they acted horribly. It was NOT funny at all even though they tried really hard for it to be. I guess they deserve some credit for that...well the movie isn't worth your time. Just look at its rating. The movie (and the series) is very painful to watch for anyone who has even half a brain. Seriously if you liked it you need to go watch movies where the actors actually act not babbling their lines in a monotone. I am on the drama club at my school and some people there are actually BETTER than those Nat and Alex guys. Hurry before it's too late! I seriously thought that Herbie Fully Loaded was better than this piece of poopie. I don't even know why I went through even HALF of that film. I don't think it even deserves to be called a film... 
 This is awesomely bad and awesomely embarassing for a Canadian. We grow good wine. Our writers and poets are among the world's best. The National Ballet is rated among the top five companies in the world. BUT WE MAKE BLOODY AWFUL MOVIES! This one isn't especially bad. It's especially typical and typically bad shot in two bit hotels and public parks with thin direction high school level acting and gee whiz...lets see what this button on the camera does?? photography. If Michael Moriarity was so intent on doing a Jack Nicholson impersonation couldn't he at least have done a GOOD Jack Nicholson impersonation? And if the movie was shot in Vancouver truly one of the loveliest cities on earth and also a centre of yacht building (part of the plot ) why in God's name do we let that endemic Canadian inferiority complex dictate that it be disguised as Seattle??? Not only am I mad about this film I'm embarassed and more than a little ashamed. The Australians turn out some splendid stuff. We produce pretentious second rate piffle. Gawd!!!!! 
 I fell asleep on my couch at 7:35pm last night watching Larry Sanders (I usually DirecTivo it but not last night). Woke up at 3am (invesment banker on the west coast) and was fascinated to see this on HBO2. I was shocked on how poor this 'movie' was. Seriously. shocked. So shocked that I had to write a commentary on iMDB. This is really really bad. the writing is boring but the directing and editing are simply below those of a freshman at a film school. Yes it is shot video. Mind you that is shot on VIDEO not DIGITAL VIDEO. It does look like a soap opera. The clips from skateboard videos have a more 'film' feel to them then this horror. I wanted to describe the poor directing but i honestly cant remember anything. The shots and blocking are stupid. yes i chose the word 'stupid'. not unconventional not daring not bold not boring just stupid. I know people reviewing this review will say well give me an example . I cant. It was 3am. but trust me I know you will watch it anyway you will be drawn by the horrible reviews. 
 The reason this is such a bad movie is because it is so very badly written and this is entirely the fault of the hack novelist Robert James Waller also author of Bridges of Madison County. The writing is bad because the plot is perfectly trite and the dialogue is wooden and implausible. A failing couple?a blocked American writer and a pretty Mexican woman with a history of which she is ashamed?are swept up by a strong self-directed criminal and after a few adventures (mostly terrifically violent) alternating with scenes that show the warmer side of the assassin she leaves the impotent partner for the killer who bad as he is sees her more clearly than anyone has before. Nothing can help this movie succeed not even the seamed face of Scott Glenn as the killer not the appealing latinity of Giovanna Zacaras as Luz and not even the stalwart performance of Harvey Keitel as the CIA specialist assigned to track the killer down. A serious waste of time. 
 The Howling II starts as it means to go on with a bizarre and surreal opening narration by Christopher Lee whose image is imposed over a moving star field oh and a skeleton appears as well for some reason. He says for it's written the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with her blood. And I saw her sip upon a hairy beast and she held forth a golden challis full of the filthiest fornication's and upon her forehead was written behold I am the great Mother of #an inaudible word I couldn't make out no matter how many times I rewound the tape and tried to sorry# and all abominations of the Earth . This opening narration means nothing at all and is just downright bizarre. After the opening credits which are set over shots of Transylvanian architecture we get an on screen caption that informs us we're in 'Los Angeles California U.S.A. City of the Angels'. I knew I was in for a long 86 minutes. It's probably not too long after the events of the original Howling (1981) and it's Karen White's funeral. After the ceremony Karen's brother Ben (Reb Brown) is spoken to by an 'occult investigator' called Stefan Crosscoe (Christopher Lee) who says that Karen is a Werewolf and that she will come back to life. Ben dismisses such nonsense. But together with one of Karen's friends and colleagues Jenny (Annie McEnroe) he visits Stefan at his home. There Stefan tells them about Werewolves and how they can be killed he mentions Stirba (Sybil Danning) who is the queen of Werewolves. Stefan also shows them a photograph taken at Karen's funeral of a woman named Mariana (Marsha A. Hunt) and that she is an extremely vicious and dangerous Werewolf who wants Karen. Stefan says he will stake any Werewoves through the heart with titanium. Ben figures out that Stefan means he will stake Karen as well so together with Jenny he travels to the graveyard where his sister's crypt is to stop Stefan. However lots of Werewolves turn up and attack Stefan Ben and Jenny. They survive the attack and manage to find out that Stirba is to be found in Transylvania. They all decide to travel to Transylvania and stop Stirba and her Werewolves from taking over the Earth by fulfilling a centuries old curse. Once there they travel to a small town called Vlkava which means 'where wolves live' and meet up with the local priest Father Florin (Ladislav Krecmer) and his small but loyal group of Werewolf hunters hey what else can I call them? Oh and a dwarf named Florica (Ludmila Safarova) helps too. They follow Mariana who they hope will lead them to Stirba. But Stirba knows of Stefan's arrival and has plans for him Ben and Jenny. Will Stefan be able to put an end to Stirba's plans for world domination? Will this film get any more bizarre or surreal? Watch it and find out. Directed by Philippe Mora this is one strange mess of a film. It's poorly edited as certain sequences just jump around incoherently. The single biggest problem is the script by Robert Sano and Gary Brandner based on his novel which is all over the place and doesn't make any sort of sense or introduces us to any proper characters that we like. Luckily it moves along like a rocket and is never dull or boring unlike the original. Something strange or bizarre is always happening to keep the viewer entertained. Most people will probably hate it but for those of us who enjoy 'bad' films this is right up there with the best of them. There are Werewolf orgies which are just freaky to watch. We get some cool Werewolf killing weaponry. The sets and locations just seem so out of place and I don't know if this was actually shot in Transylvania but it doesn't look like what I thought mid 80's Transylvania would. Stirba's castle is part dungeon part Gothic castle and part modern luxury house. Stirba and her servant's costumes are very over-the-top Stirba wears an outfit that looks like it belongs in a S/M video and to be fair to her she looks pretty sexy and her minions wear skimpy leather clothing too. The special make-up effects range from good to poor a dwarf's eyes explode someone has their hand ripped off and a priest has some creature emerge from his mouth but this isn't a film loaded with gore although there are plenty of effect sequences with Werewolf transformations and attacks. There is plenty of nudity as well as Stirba and her minions are a real randy bunch of Werewolves! I should also mention the music the soundtrack is dominated by awful rock music that I hated and I ended up turning the volume down. Acting is weak all round and what on Earth was Christopher Lee thinking about when he accepted this film?! I wonder what he thinks of it. Basically the whole thing is a real mess but I found it a fairly entertaining mess all the same. Impossible to recommend but it kept me watching through to the end. Speaking of which the end credits run over what appears to be deleted scenes and cut footage it also features the same shot of Sybil Danning taking her dress off and exposing her breasts probably in excess of 20 times! If that's your thing. 
 The first Cube movie was an art movie. It set up a world in which all the major archetypes of mankind were represented and showed how they struggled to make sense of a hostile world that they couldn't understand. It was on the non-literal level a man vs. cruel nature plot where the individual who represented innocence and goodness came through in the end triumphing to face a new indefinable world beyond man's petty squabbles; a world where there were no more struggle but peace. I rated Cube a 10 out of 10 and it's a movie that was never meant to have any sequels. The second movie Hypercube was a massive disappointment. Some of the ideas were kind of cool but in the context of the original movie both the story and the setting made no sense and had no meaning. Still for being fairly entertaining I rated it a 5 out of 10. The third movie Cube Zero while ignoring the second plays like a vastly inferior commercial B-movie rehash of the first sans the symbolism. There is no homage or tribute here; there is only ripping off. The same kind of plot with some elements idiotically altered (like having letters instead of prime numbers between the cubes - an idea which shows more clearly than anything else that this is a rip-off with absolutely no originality and nothing to say). That we see something from behind the scenes means nothing because the watchers are just part of the Big Bad Experiment the architects of which we hear nothing of. And in this movie those who get through to the exit (like Kazan did at the end of the first movie) are just killed - where the *bleep* is the sense in that?! That's just flippin' stupid. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this. The production values and acting in Cube Zero are not too bad but the story and the ideas are so utterly devoid of any inspiration that this movie can only get from me a rating of 3 out of 10. 
 I really really wanted to like Julian Po. I think that Slater is underrated as an actor and that many of the supporting players here are better than they are given a chance to demonstrate in this film. I realize this is based on a short story which I have not read. So I do not know if what I see as the film's faults originated with the story or were imposed on it by the director/screenwriter. The premise is wonderful and I loved the voiceover confessional tone the opening narration strikes. But then...? Nothing! Several of the cliched local characters ask Julian pointblank to explain his intention to commit suicide. One could argue that he doesn't answer because it's none of their business. But Julian is the one who under only token pressure blurted out his intentions in public. Then neither Julian nor the director/writer despite the fact that the Julian character is keeping a tape recorded journal for God's sake seem inclined to provide anything beyond the scant initial information on Julian's life. He says he was a bookkeeper. He says his family moved around when he was a child due to his father's job. So what? There are several interactions with the locals which seem designed to illuminate Julian's purpose. But none of them go anywhere because Julian seems to regard all these dopey locals as if they were aliens from another planet as if he were the ultimate (and only) sane one among them. This might work as an allegory if Julian Po had any defining characteristics or anything approaching wisdom to impart. The closest he comes to revealing anything about himself is in the scene in which he purposely humiliates the naive religious wife of the mechanic. And what this scene reveals is not anything that would inspire empathy for Julian. I can only see the Julian character --as rendered--as selfish petty and totally condescending. Sort of matches the attitude of the director of this half-baked contrived film. And poor Michael Parks an actor who once had so much promise is given nothing to work with here. 
 A different look at horror. The styling differences between American and Russian films is interesting. However from my American perspective this movie just wasn't that good. The protagonist Marie played by Anastasia Hille wasn't a pleasant character and I had a hard time identifying with her. She was disagreeable most of the time and confused for much of what little time was left. Also too much time was spent in bringing her to the main location of the film. Then a long time passed before any real suspense built up. Once that happened it seemed volume was used as the main effect which was more annoying than anything else. The concept was more original than most Direct-to-video movies and they didn't use sex to make up for a thin plot. All in all I'd recommend it for renting but not for theater goers. 
 This short spoof can be found on Elite's Millennium Edition DVD of Night of the Living Dead . Good thing to as I would have never went even a tad out of my way to see it.Replacing zombies with bread sounds just like silly harmless fun on paper. In execution it's a different matter. This short didn't even elicit a chuckle from me. I really never thought I'd say this but Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil Mutant Alien Flesh Eating Hellbound Zombified Living Dead Part 2: In Shocking 2-D was a VERY better parody and not nearly as lame or boring. My Grade: F 
 A mercilessly corny and painfully unfunny attempt to transplant the character of Sheriff Bart from Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles into his own weekly sitcom this is really as bad as some people say it is! The laugh-track only serves to remind the unamused viewer what all in this supposed comedy is intended to be a joke and just how desperate for laughs it really is! However it is somewhat interesting to see Louis Gossett Jr. trying his best to impersonate Cleavon Little. His embarrassment shows through in every scene. He was much funnier in the HBO movie El Diablo than he was here in this slab of cheese! Truly the best and funniest thing about Black Bart is the name of his horse! 
 Adapting plays into cinema is often a bad idea because they're two different mediums . Do you think it's a great idea to make ZULU into a stage play ? Imagine it where two valiant redcoats sit in a tent gasping Blimey there's thousands of them out there Great movie and a bad stage play In order for a stage play to make great cinema there's two essentials needed 1) A fine cast that creates on screen chemistry 2 ) Great dialogue On paper Cher and Chazz Palminterri would be a good casting choice but not in these roles . The story revolves around a hit-man played by Palminterri breaking into a house to kill a wife played by Cher with most of the action taking place inside the house . I was unable to take these two characters seriously though perhaps it was the fault of the script which can't decide whether it was trying to be serious or funny . Since the story is very static it's of the utmost importance that the dialogue shines and once again because of the bizarre tone of the screenplay it embarrasses more than anything else with much of the conversation revolving around sex acts . if you want to see a great translation of a stage play transferred to the silver screen give FAITHFUL a miss and watch 12 ANGRY MEN instead 
 Well I'd be lying if I said that this could easily rival Spiderman or the Batman movies. Still it was more appealing to me for it's moral value. I first bought the VHS when my son was about 2 years old and it immediately became his favorite. My wife and I are avid supporters of Robert Townsend and have been since he used credit cards to finance his first movie Hollywood Shuffle . True he needs to take advantage of the talents and knowledge of technical advisors to make the films more believable but his movies are still fun. Meteor Man provides a hero with an Urban Contemporary feel. I always felt that if there were superheroes they wouldn't provide the same scenarios as depicted in the comics. Meteor Man is realistic hero with real problems: Car broken into bad neighborhood local drug-dealing gangs using children for distribution etc. The scope of his mission stayed pretty much within the community. What I found to be truly entertaining outside of James Earl Jones' young forever performance was how the neighborhood responded to his newly discovered powers. It wasn't long before they had a full agenda lined up for him without his input of course. It was hilarious to hear them offer to lend him out to other communities where their extended families lived. Yes the plot was weak the movie was predictable there was bad acting and continuity was rotten but it ranks #1 with my kids. Robert Townsend works to bring movies home so to speak. I doubt he'll ever truly be recognized as the talented actor/producer/director he truly is but there are and will always be those that love him for his efforts. One point to ponder about the film which I find amusing: Throughout the entire battle with Simon no one bothered to call the police???? Also what mother and father do you know that will watch their son fight from a window? My mother would have been right there scrapping by my side toe-to-toe. Dad would be loading his pistol. lol Rent it and check it out. It's worth seeing at least once and good for those of you that are fans of Sinbad Luther Vandross Bill Cosby Big Daddy Kane etc. Great job with the cameos Robert! 
 Vincente Minelli movies are usually worth your time; Meet Me in St Louis The Bad and the Beautiful. I awaited this movie with great interest. But what a disappointment. Some Came Running is scene after scene of go-nowhere fatalism. Sinatra is a sad sack returned from the war to find disappointing family relationships a disappointing floozy hanging on him living in disappointing digs as a gal persuades him to finish his disappointing writing project. The movie has a big dramatic finish in which a disappointing villain catches up with Sinatra and MacClane and something disappointing happens. The sequence is intended to be tension-filled but Minelli is no Hitchcock; he gets so distracted by pretty colors he doesn't notice the scene is a wheezing clich and the characters are so thinly-drawn and poorly developed we don't particularly care that they get shot. (especially MacClane) But that's the only real cinematography in the project. Otherwise we look at constipated characters standing around bars & living rooms getting on each others nerves for two hours. Hell IS other people apparently. There is nothing going on in this movie. The dilemma of soldiers returning to displacement and indifference after WW2 is handled more deftly in 'The Best Years of Our Lives.' And either of two Inge products 'Splendor in the Grass' and 'Picnic' covers the desperation of being trapped in a dead-end town with much more poignance. 
 I thought it would at least be aesthetically beautiful. It was slow pretentious and boring. I almost fell asleep. There are some decent songs but there is this one song at the end which is just some guy yelling out Yaowwww! while someone taps randomly on a wooden object. That being said there are some pretty songs but it's not worth seeing hte movie over. Go on itunes (they have the album) preview it and choose the good ones. Half the movie is some guy making tea. Well that's a slight exaggeration. But you'll see what I mean if you see it. That being said: DON'T SEE IT! 
 I had hoped this movie was going to be mildly entertaining like other sorts of its genre. However it was lame and I didn't find myself laughing very much. Watch it on HBO maybe or if you've got a free rental to waste and you need a movie to pass the time. But I don't recommend paying to see it. The plot is simple and straightforward and it could have been funny maybe if the script was better. Jason Lee can be hilarious and he gets a few laughs here and there but the movie falls flat. Just don't go see this one. The directing is lackluster but for what it is directing isn't that important. I guess its main drawback is that it is just not very funny. See something else don't waste your time here. 
 9 the film I've been looking forward to for months.... was little more then a disappointment. I was deeply surprised by 9's lack of story and strange character development. All the awesome action sequences in the world don't make up for a single unsympathetic character. The strange almost thrown in occult sequences were not only out of place they were infuriating. The story is about robots and scientists... why does it suddenly turn into a necronomicon horror wannabe with mystical symbols and green magic ghost lines instead of giving answers to what could have been excellently scary story devices?? How what when why.... questions that bode asking only if you care and it becomes less and less likely that you will as you get away from the theater. A film like this is frustrating because of its lack of depth.... I would watch this film drawn in crayon if the story was good. But the filmmakers have relied on CGI wizardry and Tim Burtons name to draw in the crowd. Which... is what drew me in but failed to gain my respect. 9 could have been awesome... with a few more rewrites and a little more respect from its own creators. 
 Ah the infamous Guinea Pig series...I honestly have to say that I've been disappointed as a whole by this entire series ( He Never Dies Mermaid in a Manhole and Flower of Flesh and Blood being the exceptions...and even those aren't great by any means...) but Devil's Experiment just plain blows. There is nothing realistic-looking going on here other than the climactic (or perhaps anti-climactic depending on how you view it) eyeball piercing scene. The victim appears to not really care what is going on and barely whines or whimpers while being subjected to hideous (more often sometimes hilarious ) tortures. Flower of Flesh and Blood is a more violent and gory depiction of fake snuff material but that film also falls flat on the realism level. I applaud the Japanese for pushing the boundaries and they've really come a long way over the past 2 decades to wear the crown in extreme film-making but Devil's Experiment just doesn't hold up. Worth a look if you are a die-hard if for no other reason than to see what the fuss is about but I can only give this film an extremely generous 3/10 and that's only for the needle-through-the-eye scene... 
 This film was slated to be a blockbuster film and it really is. This is the type of movie that is made to eat popcorn to and watch the flashy graphics. With that in mind the movie delivers perhaps not as well as the ultra flashy Iron Man but well enough. Outside of the popcorn munching action and special effects the film drops off of the cliff faster than Wile E. Coyote. Many viewers myself included will complain about how most of the characters were severely altered but that only makes the film a poor adaptation not a poor film. This film is unsatisfactory for other reasons. The makers focused more on making it appealing to the eye than they did to the mind. The characters that have been long awaited and promoted are reduced to 4-scene cameos. The main characters of Wolverine Victor Creed (never called Sabertooth in the film) and Colonel Stryker are well developed. I was pleasantly surprised by Liev Schriber's performance. The rest of the characters are tossed to the wayside to make way for the all important eye-candy. Wolverine's character is fully developed after 30-minutes as is Sabertooth though Victor does pull off some surprises late in the film. The final boss of the film is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the original character and barely gets any development to show just why he is the way he is. The filmmakers obviously felt that all they really needed to do was create a bad ass character who could do anything they wanted and slapped on the name of a popular character. Very disappointing... 
 I saw this movie way back when it premiered. It was based on the notion that autistic children could communicate with typed-out messages with someone else merely aiding them and guiding their hands. Then suddenly these children many of whom weren't even observing the keyboard or the screen when the messages were being typed out (they could be looking up at the ceiling in some instances) but their moderators were eyes glued on the keyboard began typing messages of abuse from their parents and other persons sending parents and child welfare agencies in a proberbial tizzy left and right. This whole thing was proved a fallacy when a third person presented a folder opened it to the child and said 'type the picture you see' then as the presenter turned the folder to the moderator a fold would fall down revealing another different picture. So while the child may have seen a dog the moderator saw something like a boat. Every time every bloomin' time the name of the picture typed was what the moderator had observed never what the child was shown. So who was doing the typing? Never the child. This movie further took a disastrous turn with as the Australia poster stated the person who molested the child in the movie was IN the situation trying to help the child. Had Melissa Gilbert never put her son IN that place he wouldn't have been molested is what the movie says. He was better off under her supervision. If I turn my kid over to your organization for aid and he gets molested instead do you think I'm going to be keen to listen to anything you have to say after that? Not likely! I think it is a safe bet that all of these accusatory messages that these kids were typing out that this movie was based on they never accused someone within their operation as took place here. Unfortunately I do recall that the movie gave a very good performance from Gilbert as the mother of an autistic but other than that the movie really didn't do much. The worst by far was the child typing at the end to Patty Duke and we hear the mechanical voice read back what he typed . . . . . we won! This child was molested. If you cut my leg off and I take you to court and you are found guilty of damaging me assault whatever then that is legal justice but it doesn't bring my leg back. At best in my condition I will view it as a hollow victory. Whatever chance this child had at what is perceived as normalcy with the autism alone is further damaged by the molestation. A 'normal' child has enough to contend with from such an experience. It's utterly superficial to think that you must look upon any situation and go 'we won' if that person is found guilty in court. Just a bad handling of a situation and circumstances all the way around here. 
 I'd never seen a Tarzan movie before so when I saw it on the tele I thought I'd give it a shot. Unfortunately I have to say I was disappointed. Tarzan was over 40 years old and somewhat overweight. Not how I'd imagined Tarzan would look. And unless I missed it while making myself a cup of tea Tarzan never gave his traditional warbling yell. Also missing was Tarzan swinging through the trees - leaping from vine to vine. Oh well so much for expectations. Anyway Jane was there - The monkey Cheeta was there. There was some guy with a guitar there. There were villains and good guys and a romance... all very harmless and predictable. Nothing bad you understand but equally nothing good. Probably not the best movie to introduce Tarzan: 4/10 
 I love Henry James books and Washington Square was no exception. I was very excited to see a new movie coming out based on the book of that title. Jennifer Jason Lee is an exceptional actress and Ben Chaplin good enough to play the lead roles. Albert Finney is miscast and doesn't carry the role well. I wanted to shoot Maggie Smith....or rather her silly insipid role. The real problem and what's lacking in this latest version is a good script music and direction. I fell asleep in the theater watching this long drawn out and exceptionally boring movie. There are more pauses in the dialog than a Pinter Play. In the book I felt a deep caring for Catherine Sloper and her life. The movie had just the opposite effect. I also disliked the twist where her aunt has a sexual attraction to Morris. Eeeeeeeek. YUK. Watch it if you can't sleep it's a definite snoozer. Don't watch it if you're depressed. You'll need Zoloft after this. Sure The Heiress was exceptional with Olivia Haviland and Montgomery Clift in the title roles. The actor who played her father was on the mark as the uncaring cold father....still grieving for his dead wife and hating Catherine for it. The movie was not faithful to the book but neither is this one. This movie was a box office flop. I have no doubts as to why. 
 I watched this movie last night and hoped for the best after watching all the cool trailers.Even the cover of the DVD looked good.As soon as I started watching it I was thinking like others oh my God whats this .There were some moments that were a bit creepy but then the mood was ruined by stupid music.There was rock and opera during what is supposed to be suspenseful scenes.That right there ruined it for me and i was shaking my head thinking damn I wasted money again on a rental and was deceived by the cover art.Nothing against the music itself it was just in the wrong parts of the movie.Whoever edited the film has no clue what they are doing.The cover showed lightning implying they were caught in a storm at sea.That would have been more interesting but it didn't happen. The acting wasn't the worst i've ever seen considering they are all unknown and this is obvious their first film.Another reason I was disappointed was the plot made no sense.In the beginning 2 men saw all of the teens get on a boat then at the end supposedly only 1 girl existed and the others were either her imaginary friends or were ghosts i'm not sure because it was very badly portrayed. WhyteFox who wrote a comment on here claims this is a true story.He or she believes in ghosts and spirits and says there is a haunted boat in the area this movie was filmed.There was no mention in this movie about it being a true story.I have never experienced something like that personally but am not saying it's impossible.I guess if anyone is interested in renting this movie do it at your own risk.If you like amateur student horror films you may like this. 
 Turkish Cinema has a big problem. Directors aren't interested in global cinema. They are local and folkloric but want to be international. This brings kitsch results such this movie. Film has jokes translated to Spanish from Turkish and they don't have any meaning for non-Turkish audiences. Even for Turkish audiences after 10 years. Players even Ferhan SENSOY have a worse acting than average. They act like puppets. Movie was shot in Cuba but nothing includes about Cuba. So Cuba is thought like a banana republic. Waste of money waste of time. 
 This series just gets worse and worse. Poorly written and just plain not funny! The premise is excellent but the writer's inexperience shines through. By trying so hard to offend no one they end up insulting everyone. Now into the second season the desperate cast have stopped waving their arms about and resorted to that patronizing smug Oh silly you style acting that comes with a no laugh script. They roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say aren't we zany? Isn't this funny? Well no it's not actually. Gum disease is less painful. No wonder with the exception of Corner Gas Canadians generally avoid Canadian TV. Come on CBC you're suppose to be our leading station showcasing the best of Canadian talent. Pull the plug on this amateurish mess. 
 Former brat pack actor and all round pretty boy Rob Lowe stars in a film set in a high security American prison . I had a gut feeling his character was going to be popular for all the wrong reasons like Tobias in the first series of OZ but PROXIMITY isn`t that kind of film it`s more like a Man on the run film like THE FUGITIVE . It also makes a nod to the themes of punishment and justice with James Coburn putting in a cameo as the spokesman for a justice for victims pressure group but any intelligent discussion on how society should treat criminals is completely ignored as the film degenerates into tired old cliches of shoot outs and car chases 
 The Van is a feelgood movie about a guy who tries to lure girls into his new van in order to seduce them. The only thing this movie doesn't fail at is precisely depicting the van fad in the US in the late 70s. It looks like it was totally made by amateurs. It's trash but I loved it! I have to admit I am a fan of 70s trash! Hope this one makes it to the IMDB bottom 100! 2 
 My first clue about how bad this was going to be was when the video case said it was from the people who brought us Blair Witch Project which was a masterpiece in comparison to this piece of garbage. The acting was on the caliber of a 6th grade production of Oklahoma and the plot such as there was is predictable boring and inane. 85% of the script is four letter words and innumerable variations on them. Mother F seems to be the writer's favorite because it is used constantly. It must have taken all of 10 minutes to write this script in some dive at last call. Thank God I rented it and could jump through most of it on fast forward. Don't waste your time or money with this. 
 this by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. I gave up to watch it after an hour and regretted that hour a lot. the acting is horrible and there is almost no plot. my guess is that someone came up with a strange shape of an animal and started to make a story around of it. borrowing some ideas from movies like Resident Evil and Aliens doesn't result in a movie like them. if this going to be a top Korean movie I'd rather won't bother to see even a Korean movie trailer... By the way this movies is a good reason to believe that not necessarily a high rating means the movie is promising. I think every Korean who has internet for online gaming rated this movie over the 8 even though has no clue what it is about. 
 This is far worse than those awful Laurel and Hardy cartoons of the 60s. They were terrible but at least they were simple ripoffs of a then Stan and Ollie resurgence. New audiences had rediscovered the pair's comedic genius and the cartoons were mind-numbing garbage geared to cash in on children's interest. It was to be expected. But how does one even attempt to rationalize this work of... I can't even think of a word. I'm sure the makers hoped it would somehow inspire another Laurel and Hardy revival but you can't inspire interest in the past with a shallow and unfunny caricature of what made the original so appealing. The impressionists (I hesitate to call them actors) do a Vegas act and that's where it belongs. The plot is even flimsier than those used in the old days trying to stretch out two-reel ideas for a feature. If this film was someone's first exposure to the REAL Laurel and Hardy I'm sure that viewer would dismiss the original duo's reputation as senility gone amok. The only movie I hate worse than this is I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE. And you know these filmmmakers basically did the same thing to Stan and Ollie. 
 I am not an artistically inclined individual. I am a science minded woman and I felt that this movie was maybe one of those campy artsy type films on a budget. I watched part of it with my fianc and my future step daughter. We tried very hard to find something in this film to keep our interest. My fianc and his daughter voted it off and we moved on to Ocean's 13 but that is another story. Not to be deterred I awoke the next morning and gave the movie another shot. I began again watching this movie in earnest. I just don't get it I thought I would get it.I thought the funniest part was the flushing of the ashes and the urn finding a spot by the fireplace being used as a vase for what appeared to be dead flowers. Interesting and still it had dead stuff inside. It was an odd and bizarre movie. Maybe this is what they were after however I won't be tricked a second time! 
 This is a movie about how men think women think about love. No woman describes a one-night sexual encounter and declares it a love story. Of the ten monologues I felt only three really had any kind of truth ring through them. I kept waiting for the film to get better and it did a bit but never better enough. This is an interesting concept and I kept wanting it to be good but it never succeeded. Maybe if they actually WERE love stories it would have worked. 
 It's terrible how some people can get away with such things... This is one of those overrated things again... And I hate things that are overrated that are no good... Why can't we have more TV Shows and Movies that actually have a story and excellent music and that are well written and are actually about something?? It takes many people to make this movie the series and the band all possible and those people are all wasting their time... It seems that the bands are getting younger and younger... I looked at how small that they were and I thought that they were 5 or 6. It's sad that kids are performing that young... They are still too young... Performing takes a lot of work and they have many other things that they need to do with their lives... The idea about having a very young band is horrible... They need to stop having bands like this... And I don't like the idea at all nor the kids themselves... They are very annoying very young and their name is The Naked Brothers Band The people that are involved in this and the people that are supporting this have all lost their minds... Whenever this band is shown on TV change the channel and petition to get it banned... And I know that this is a very boring comment thing but you get the point... This Band Sucks... Get Rid Of It... 
 Well it looked good on paper Nick Cage and Jerry Buckheimer collaborate again this time on a mix of heist movie Da Vinci Code American History 101 and Indiana Jones. But oh dear this is to Indiana Jones what Speed 2 is to Speed. A reasonable cast(including John Voight and Harvey Keitel) battles against a puerile script and loses badly. The film is little more than an extended advert for the Freemasons.However these Freemasons are not your usual shopkeepers who use funny handshakes and play golf these Freemasons are the natural descendants of the Knights Templar (and nobody mention 'From Hell' or Jack the Ripper.)I don't think I've revealed any plot spoilers because there are none. There is virtually no suspense no surprises and no climax- it just stops. National Treasure aims for Dan Brown but hits the same intellectual level as an episode of Scooby Doo sans the humour. 
 A terrible amateur movie director (no not Todd Sheets) his new friend and sister explore a cave. The friend and sister fall in and get rescued. Meanwhile a gang of horribly acted girls are defending their 'turf'. Whatever the heck that means. This film and I use the term VERY loosely is so bad that it's.. well bad. The humor is painfully unfunny the action merely sad. Now I've seen some atrociously awful 'horror' films in my time & failed to grow jaded in my approach to watching low-budget films yet I still weep openly for anyone who choose to sit through this. ONLY for the most hardened maschocists amongst you. but the rest run away FAST!! My Grade: F 
 Quentin Crisp once stated that when things are shown too beautifully one is a romantic. When things are show unbearably grim they are realistic. And when something gets the ironic treatment they're spot on. Unfortunately for Leon de Aranoa he falls into the second catagory. This director has obviously tried too hard to make a Spanish Ken Loach type movie without being able to capture the comedy and warmth between the characters that elevate Loach movies from merely being 'depressing'. Los Lunes al Sol is just that only depressing. Things are unrealistically grim. The characters ultimate moments of misery all reach a climax at the same point and if the glum story isn't enough Aranoa washes the tale over with a visually grey and grimy colour palette. The films was ridiculously over-rated at the Goyas. A movie that shows empathy for the weaker citizens in society in this case unemployed harbour workers does not automatically make for a good movie even though I would be the first to sympathize with the fates of these people. This movie only manages to make me grow disinterested in their fate. In 21st century Spain unemployed people do not live like beggars and the public transport ferries have decent restrooms and it's hard to come across a bar with so few punters and such little happiness to be encountered in it. Leon de Aranoa obviously doesn't have a clue about working class Spain and does it no favours. Pretentious is the only conclusion I can draw. The scene where the men watch a football match for free has been directly copied from a film which deals much more 'realistically' with the subject of the 'poverty' trap namely Purely Belter which is afar more engaging humorous and yet sad. 
 How Disney can you get? Preppy rich girls act like idiots buy a bunch of stuff and get taught a lesson. Is Disney trying to send a lesson to itself? That maybe while buying everything it should maybe still be human? Whatever the psycho-analysis this movie sucked. The girls want a rich party for their rich lives. But then money disappears and they have to use their riches to get the milk plant (yes milk) going to employ the workers. They keep it afloat until daddy comes home. And the man at the beginning who appears to be the one that takes the money is the one. But the ending is dumb. Webcam in the Cayman Islands? Huh? Not worth my time ever again. But it is better than Howl's Moving Castle. D-  
 I rented this movie because it falls under the genres of romance and western with some Grand Canyon scenery thrown in. But if you're expecting a typical wholesome romantic western forget it. This movie is pure trash! The romance is between a YOUNG GIRL who has not even gone through puberty and a MIDDLE-AGED MAN! The child is also lusted after by other leering men. It's sickening. Peter Fonda is portrayed as being virtuous by trying to resist his attraction to Brooke Shields and her character is mostly the one that pursues the relationship. He tries to shoo her off at first but eventually he gives in and they drive off as a happy loving couple. It's revolting. I don't see how this movie could appeal to anyone except pedophiles. 
 I purchased the BLOOD CASTLE DVD on eBay for a few bucks not knowing what it was and all I can say is that I wasn't disappointed with this purchase. BLOOD CASTLE is one of those trashy European horror films that has almost no redeeming quality except for being thoroughly entertaining for all the bad reasons. The opening alone was worth the price of the DVD: our heroine Dr. Ivanna arrives at the castle where she's supposed to help a scientist Baron Dalmar who does experiments on dead tissue. On her way to the castle 1) a man tries to rape Ivanna. 2) the castle's housekeeper fights with her. 3) the maid wants her dead. 4) and finally Baron Dalmar nearly spits on her and wants her out the next day. Hmm...something tells me she's not welcome. With such a miserable arrival you'd think Ivanna would leave the place in a NY minute but no like so many great trashy films our headstrong heroine decides to stay put and even enjoys a candlelight dinner with the grumpy Baron on that same eventful day. The intro is so over-the-top trashy (it's even greater than the memorable first few minutes of that Canadian film JUNIOR) that I knew I was going to enjoy this. But the fun doesn't end there. Ivanna is repeatedly drugged whenever she goes to bed at night only to wake up from unconsciousness naked bound and tortured in mild sessions of S&M by an unseen man. Even after experiencing these nightly S&M sessions Ivanna stays at the castle dully convinced by the angry Baron that what she's experiencing are nothing more than dreams. To be expected even after being treated so badly from the get-go Ivanna falls in love with the Baron. Ivanna completely disregards anything negative about him including the obvious fact that the dour Baron is popular with the young ladies. Every women at the castle (it seems only women work there) is in love with the miserable chump who doesn't mind taking advantage of the pretty young things. Things get even sillier as someone lurks around the estate and kills (and has been killing) women. Basically the Baron's physically disfigured brother Igor is responsible for everything. In a very long winded scene the brother warns the Baron he should not get too involved with Ivanna or he'll suffer the consequences. So what do the Baron and Ivanna do about this? Well they get married of course! During the very brief marriage ceremony the Baron is shot by one of the angry locals (father of one of the dead girls). But all of this doesn't deter Ivanna who amidst all the dead young ladies and torture surrounding them cheerfully comforts the hurt Baron that it's just a flesh wound and the two can go on and enjoy their honeymoon at the castle where the killer/rapist/torturer brother is. The whole thing quickly devolves into a nightmarish love triangle of sorts between Ivana the Baron and Igor. Blame it all on love! Anyway you get the idea: subtle it's not. Almost everything is over-the-top ridiculous in this film and when it's not OTT such as the predictable climax things get a tad boring. But for most of the film the director or writer revel in one illogically trashy moment after another. I really love these kind of films everything as subtle as being hit over the head with a sledgehammer and populated by characters behaving illogically. Even those who made the Retromedia DVD realize this and when you go to the scene selection section we hear one of the funniest bits of dialogue from the dubbed movie looped endlessly. The production values are beautifully risible. The opening and closing credits with those candles and red curtains...ah a soup?on of class. The music sounds sometimes like something from a Tim Burton film which only adds to the oddness of it all. And customary to these kind of films when the young ladies take off their clothes they just beg to be killed. As a standard film I rate this a 2 but as a it's so bad it's good film I rate it a solid 8 stars. If you enjoy trashy films please watch this one. It's a must see. The only thing left for me to ponder about it: what would it have taken for that woman to get out of that freaking castle? 
 Boy this movie had me fooled. I honestly thought it would be a campy horror film with absolutely no humor in it whatsoever boy I got the cold shoulder that time. This movie was and I'm truthful pretty damn good. It was not scary at all but the campiness and the sly humor really mad this movie interesting. Some to the horrible acting and clich killings were so painful to watch I almost laughed at how bad it was but to some extent I enjoyed it. The killings all vaguely relate to snow sports and Christmas which made things more intriguing. The POV camera angles were awesome. The movie is about a viscous killer who dies in a car accident collision with a chemical truck while being transported to prison. He is later resurrected in that very same chemical with snow spliced into the mixture. These were the ingredients chosen to make the perfect killer snowman. He than takes his revenge as the snowman on the police officer who convicted him. This movie had such bad acting with the exception of Christopher Allport that is was funny. I will say that I am also pretty disappointed that this movie was not a horror but in fact a dark sitcom. They had a great story with a good plot but it wasn't executed right. All in all I like the movie at first but now it is really annoying. But this movie is way better and darker than the sequel. 
 Is this film a joke? Is it a comedy? Surely it isn't a serious thriller? There is no suggestion that there is any intended humor but on quite a few occasions the poor acting poor directing and appalling script had the audience laughing out loud in the cinema. The plot is acceptable - a promising young artist just reaching his peak shot dead by an assassin he walks in on by mistake. The killer sees the young artists work portfolio he is carrying and decides to attend an exhibition of his work. At the exhibition the assassin meets the dead artists sister and they end up falling in love. It is all very predictable stuff and the end will not have anyone guessing as it is so poorly scripted. The film takes place mainly in and around Vienna Austria and shows what a beautiful city it is. Do not waste your time on this film though unless you are studying how NOT to act direct or script a film! 
 I am an avid fan of horrendous movies anything cheesy and down right ridiculous is my game. So imagine my spirit I went to the local Rent Shop and found Vampires vs. Zombies. The name is just too entertaining you know that no one in the world could pull off something like it it just has to be bad. And boy is it BAD. After viewing this horror-ific movie I was speechless literally. Me and my pal sat outside without saying a word to each other for several minutes both of us contemplating the future of our lives after watching this movie. I broke the depressing silence with the words ...dude....What? Yes i am an enthralling individual. Heres a quick 'street review' The Plot; There is none at all ever constantly in WTF mode. The Characters; No development forgettable. The Music; Worse than porn. The Vampires; Theirs vampires? The Zombies; Theirs Zombies? In the end; Everyone should see this movie honestly its so bad I yearn to see it again. So do yourself a favor watch it and get Depressed. 
 This is the kind of movie which shows the paucity of French cinema when it comes to making thrillers.The director's desire to sound American is so glaring that you will not be fooled a minute unless you have not seen a serial killer movie since Peeping Tom . Two male cops (or one and a half more like as you will see) horrible murders a plot more complicated than complex.Charles Berling is not lucky with the genre(see the astoundlingly dumb l'inconnu de Strasbourg a couple of years ago).The scenes with his pregnant wife -which are supposed to be a counterpart for the otherwise noir atmosphere of the rest of the plot-are among the worst ever filmed.Add a steamy love scene between them and a gory autopsy to get a PG 12 and thus to attract the huge adolescent audience.A violent and absurd conclusion followed by a silent epilogue who could make a nice commercial for the c?te d'azur it's really the silence of the lame. 
 Peter Fonda is so intentionally enervated as an actor that his lachrymose line-readings cancel out any irony or humor in the dialogue. He trades sassy barbs and non-witty repartee with Brooke Shields as if he were a wooden block with receding hair; even his smaller touches (like fingering a non-existent mustache on his grizzled face) don't reveal a character so much as an unsure actor being directed by himself an unsure filmmaker. In the Southwest circa 1950 a poor gambler (not above a little cheating) wins an orphaned would-be teen Lolita in a botched poker game; after getting hold of a treasure map promising gold in the Grand Canyon the bickering twosome become prospectors. Some lovely vistas and an odd but interesting cameo by Henry Fonda as a grizzled canyon man are the sole compensations in fatigued comedy-drama with the two leads being trailed by cartoonish killers who will stop at nothing until they get their hands on that map. Shields is very pretty but--although the camera loves her pouty glossy beauty--she has no screen presence (and her tinny voice has no range whatsoever); every time she opens her mouth one is inclined to either cringe or duck. *1/2 from **** 
 Like Freddy's Revenge this sequel takes a pretty weird idea and doesn't go to great lengths to squeeze a story out of it. Basically Alice from number 4 is pregnant and her baby is haunted by Freddy which gives him an outlet to haunt her friends. This has the least deaths out of the whole series and the wise-cracks are quite poor so neither the horror fans or comedy fans are happy. I've not alot to say about this. It's moderately interesting to see the characters of Alice and Dan returning from four but not worth watching a movie over. Uninspriring and unenjoyable possibly only the competant direction saves it from being the worst in the series. 
 Too bad neither the animals or Eddie Murphy had anything to say worth saying. this movie is just bland. Children's movie? Well if you're trying to get them to take a nap then maybe. It's just 90 minutes of some eye-wrenchingly poor animal lip animation to quips that aren't funny. And the lip-sync'ing makes the old Godzilla films look brilliantly done by comparison. Meanwhile Eddie Pluto Nash Murphy drones on with a suppressed understated delivery that is painful to experience. Apparently he's trying to modify his old manic persona but to what? In short all the magic and wonder of the 1967 original version is lost in this re-imagining or whatever it is. A town wants to bully some forest creatures and blame them for doing bad stuff. No really. And Pluto Nash can psycho-babble with them. Things chain along with some stale jokes to a dull uninspired conclusion with no surprises. Rent the '67 movie. Or some old Yogi Bear cartoons. 
 I have never seen a movie as bad as this. It is meant to be a fun movie but the only joke is at the start and it is NOT funny. If you like this sort of movie then you may just be able to give it a vote of 2. If it had the necessary votes it would truly belong on the bottom 100. 
 This is a kind of genre thing meaning you either like the 1950s musicals or you don't. If you do you'll love this. Personally I prefer the 1930s and most of the '40s musicals with the dancing talents of Astaire and Rogers and Eleanor Powell Bill Robinson Ruby Keeler James Cagney Shirley Temple and so forth but the songs of the '50s the slower dance numbers and the soapy melodramas of the decade all turn me off. This film is a case-in-point. The first song was okay but the next three did nothing for me. By then the story didn't have much appeal either. The presence of Deborah Kerr is another minus. I don't think I've seen a movie she starred in that I liked including this one where the goody two-shoes English teacher she portrays spends half the movie threatening to leave Siam. (I which she had!). However divorcing myself from likes-and-dislikes there is no denying this Rogers and Hammerstein production has a lot of appeal to many folks particularly those who liked The Sound Of Music a decade later. There are similarities in the R&H musicals. Thus if you liked the Julie Andrews flick you should like this too. This is a Lavish production with yes a capital L. This is the kind of big-production musicals you rarely saw after that generation. You also get the dubbed singers unlike today where the actress isn't able to really sing so Marnie Nixon comes to rescue of Kerr as she did with Natalie Wood in West Side Story and Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady. Yul Brynner is King Mongkut and is the stereotypical traditionalist the kind filmmakers always portray in a negative way. He isn't progressive as the left wingers like the say but the education teacher (Kerr as Anna Leonowens ) will set him straight. Secular-progressives of today always place teachers higher than people trying to cure cancer! However Yul is good in this role and even employs some comedy along with his more-bark-than-bite character. Justifiably he is the big star of this film. Brynner had magnetism. Even in The Magnificent Seven Yul was the one cowboy who mesmerized the audience. In summary it's a fine movie for its day and millions of people enjoyed it. I'll leave it at that. 
 This could have been a rather entertaining film but instead it ranks with other duds like Leeches and Rest In Pieces at the bottom of the cinematic food chain. Had they played this flick tongue-in-cheek it could have been a very entertaining film like Re-Animator or Dead ALive but Juan Piquor Simon plays it tongue-in-cheek in spots but straight more often. The premise of this film is a small community that is besieged by mutated slugs. There is an abandoned toxic waste dump near a sewer line that mutates the slugs into aggressive meat-eating monsters - albeit monsters that move slowly and can be squished under your boot. Health Inspector Michael Garfiled and two accomplices are the only people that seem willing to fight the slugs while the sheriff and mayor think they are crazy. The climax is a laugh riot - unintentional at that - which makes you scratch your head as to how stupid (actors and screenwriter) the scenario of destroying the slugs is. STORY: $$ (No new ground charted here. Simon seems to play the gore elements tongue-in-cheek but the dialogue is straight. Had Simon worked with a clever script - one with plenty of one-liners and eccentric characters this could have been a cult film). VIOLENCE: $$$ (You won't be letdown here. We get plenty of exploding chest cavity scenes as well as a grand head explosion in the middle of a fine Italian restaurant. The blood and guts that many horror film watchers enjoy is in full swing here. You also get corpses of people who have been picked clean by the slugs and plenty of slug smashing scenes). ACTING: $ (Wow! Michael Garfield seems to know that this script is a stinker and he delivers his lines with a facial expression that suggests he knows how preposterous this film-making endeavor is. Kim Terry as his wife does an adequate job even though she does little beyond the hold-your-face-while-you-scream bit. The teenagers were all horrible actors - no exceptions. Man this film could have used Bruce Dern or Jeffrey Combs!) NUDITY: $$ (Two teens get naughty in bed before they get dispatched - in a poorly done scene - by a horde of slugs that crawled into the girl's bedroom. Both male and female nudity here). 
 Must every good story be improved with added corny Broadway music? Apparently those who can't come up with their own plots think that classic literature is just there for the plundering. I confess that Oliver Twist and similar stories are not my favorites as it is certainly true that Dickens often wrote things that leave you considerably bummed out and this was a great example of just that... So of course take this serious tale and add nauseating music and camp it up with every character from prancing orphan boys to mincing bobbies and suddenly it's uplifting? Argh. Fetch me a basin. The four stars in my rating come from casting which I could liken to that of My Fair Lady. Each of these films had a cast that a play version could be proud of but then they must go and have them sing (see complaint above). Unlike My Fair Lady those singing here could actually do so and they mercifully spared us the singing voice of Oliver Reed (pardon if I'm mistaken it's been a while). My biggest complaint I've stated. Why embarrass everyone except the truly shameless by putting silly songs into a perfectly good story? Seldom has this been done to good effect. Generally it ruins the story. It did with this one. Jury's still out on whether this story is worth saving but with all that gadding about it's impossible to tell. 
 A woman's nightmares fuel her fear of being buried alive.The cheating husband wants her dead and decides to make good use of her phobia by sticking her in a coffin and leaving her in the basement.Of course B-horror movie queen Brinke Stevens transforms into hideous ghostly creature.The only reason to see this amateurish junk flick is Michael Berryman in a really small cameo and two sex scenes with Delia Sheppard.And the last twenty minutes of Brinke's bloody rampage are quite fun to watch.The special effects for example laughable decapitated head are truly awful.Better watch Scalps or Alien Dead again.Of course I ain't expecting classy entertainment from Fred Olen Ray but Haunting Fear is too dull to be enjoyable. 
 I am a relative latecomer to the transcendent work of film auteur Yasujiro Ozu whose masterfully understated views of Japanese life especially in the post-WWII era illuminate universal truths. Having now seen several of his landmark films such as 1949's Late Spring and 1953's Tokyo Story I am convinced that Ozu had a particularly idiosyncratic gift of conveying the range of feelings arising from intergenerational conflict through elliptical narratives and subtle imagery. It is Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien's keen aspiration to pay homage to Ozu on his centenary with this generally enervating 2003 film. Among with co-screenwriter T'ien-wen Chu Hsiao-hsien appears to get the visuals right but does not capture the requisite emotional weight that would have made the glacial pacing tolerable. The story concerns Y?ko a young Japanese writer researching the life of mid-20th century Taiwanese composer Jiang Wen-Ye in Tokyo after coming back from Taiwan where she taught Japanese. After 25 drawn-out minutes of character set-up she reveals to her father and stepmother that she is pregnant by one of her students in Taiwan. At the same time Y?ko's coffeehouse friend Hajime who runs a used bookstore has an obsession for trains and seems likely to be in love with her. Hsiao-hsien connects this slim plot line with a series of shots held for inordinately lengthy takes as the frame composition changes. There are also long stretches of silence as well as an abundance of scenes featuring trains. While these techniques are consistent with Ozu's style Hsiao-hsien cannot seem to dive into the characters' psyches the way Ozu did with maximal fluidity and minimal theatrics in particular Y?ko's plight seems rather non-committal in the scheme of the drama presented and her parents' reaction overly passive to hold much interest. In fact the whole film has an atmosphere of exhaustion about it which makes the film feel interminable. The performances are unobtrusive though hardly memorable. J-pop music star Yo Hitoto brings a natural ease to Y?ko while Tadanobu Asano is something of a cipher as Hajime. The rest of the characters barely register even Nenji Kobayashi and Kimiko Yo as Y?ko's parents. Cinematographer Lee Ping-Bing provides expert work though he violates a cardinal rule of Ozu films by not keeping the camera stable during shots. Hitoto speak-sings the fetching pop song used over he ending credits Hito-Shian . The DVD includes an hour long French-made documentary Mtro Lumire which actually does help provide some of the context for Hsiao-hsien's approach to the film. It includes excerpts from Ozu's films in particular Equinox Flower to show the parallels with this film though surprisingly no mention of either Tokyo Story or Early Summer the obvious basis for some of the scenes and situation set-ups. There are also edited interview clips of Hitoto Asano and Hsiao-hsien as well as the film's trailer. 
 so... it's really sexist and classist and i thought that it might not be in the beginning stages of the movie like when stella tells steven that she would really like to change herself and begin speaking in the right way and he tells her not to change. well he certainly changed his tune and it seems that the other reviewers followed suit. what at the beginning appears to be a love story is really about social placement and women as sacrificial mothers. the end of the movie does not make her a hero it makes the whole thing sad. and its sad that people think it makes her a hero. perhaps that is the comment of the movie that people should take away. positive reception reflects continual patriarchal currents in the social conscience. yuck. 
 Confounding melodrama taken from a William Gibson story produced by John Houseman and directed by Vincente Minnelli! Richard Widmark heads up posh upscale rural nervous asylum where his loose wife battles with self-appointed queen bee Lillian Gish and Widmark himself gets the straying eye for staff-newcomer Lauren Bacall who is putting her life back together after the death of her husband and child. Facetious and muddled set in an indiscriminate time and place and with a David and Lisa love story hidden in the plush morass. Widmark and Bacall do have some good chemistry together but this script gives them nothing to build on. For precisely an hour most of the dialogue concerns what to do about the drapes hanging in the library (this thread isn't used as symbolism rather it's a red herring in a non-mystery!). The picture hopes to show the loggerheads that disparate people come to when they're working in the same profession and everyone thinks their opinion is right but unfortunately the roundabout way Minnelli unravels this stew is neither informative enlightening nor entertaining. ** from **** 
 To heighten the drama of this sudsy maternity ward story it's set in a special ward for difficult cases. The main story is Loretta Young's; she's on leave from a long prison stretch for murder. Will the doctors save her baby at the cost of her life or heed her husband's plea for the opposite? Melodrama and sentiment are dominant and they're not the honest sort to say the least. For example just to keep things moving this hospital has a psycho ward next door to the maternity ward and lets a woman with a hysterical pregnancy wander about stealing babies. There are just enough laughs and sarcasm for this to be recognizable as a Warners film mostly from Glenda Farrell who swigs gin from her hot-water bottle while she waits to have twins that to her chagrin she finds there's now a law against selling. An example of her repartee: Be careful. Farrell: It's too late to be careful. Aline MacMahon is of course wonderfully authoritative as the chief nurse but don't expect her to be given a dramatic moment. The main theme of the film is that the sight of a baby turns anyone to mush. Even given the obvious limitations this film should have been better than it is. 
 Feeding the Masses is just one of many recent mediocre zombie movies to be after your hard-earned dollars. Suggestion? Keep your hard-earned dollars and let's just say that good old TheatreX took one for the team on this one. Guess what the plots about? Zombies taking over. This time though for the sake of originality (?) this film takes place in Rhode Island and to be honest I'm not sure I've ever seen a zombie flick based in Rhode Island. A TV station controlled by the government is supposedly keeping up normal broadcasts so that any remaining citizens won't think that there's any problem in the world that is those that never look or go outside anyway. I will say though that a few of the commercials broadcast by this station were probably the most amusing part of this film. There is actually somewhat of a story to this but I'm not bothering with that because after a while you'll either not care or have fallen asleep. At any rate this has plenty of terrible acting to throw on top off all the seen it all before stuff that gets trotted out before the camera. Trust me you can find plenty of other things to do with your time than watch this. 3 out of 10. 
 in this movie joe pesci slams dunks a basketball. joe pesci... and being consistent the rest of the script is equally not believable. pesci is a funny guy which saves this film from sinking int the absolute back of the cellar but the other roles were pretty bad. the father was a greedy businessman who valued money more than people which wasn't even well-played. instead of the man being an archetypal villain he seemed more like an amoral android programmed to make money at all costs. then there's the token piece that is assigned to pesci as a girlfriend or something...i don't even remember...she was that forgettable. anyone who rates this movie above a 5 or 6 is a paid member of some sort of film studio trying to up the reputation of this sunken film or at least one of those millions of media minions who can't critique efficiently (you know the people who feel bad if they give anything a mark below 6). stay away...far away. and shame on comedy central where i saw this film. they usually pick better. 
 I rented this movie because it sounded pretty interesting but to my Horror this movie was the worst movie I had ever seen! I read the comment from Gumby-8 and he has to be a part of the cast or the crew. Unless Gumby-8 is a 4 year old child or some demented cult member no one in their right mind would think that this movie had any potential at all. I couldn't believe Gumby-8's comments. Quoting: From the Dune inspired opening animation to the quick pace...this film keeps the eye moving and works so well that repeat viewing is not unexpected. The Animation is the only aspect of the movie that was interesting and the fact of that the film keeps the eye moving well that's because you keep looking for any type of suspense. I mean give me a break Halloween was shot with a budget of $100 000.00 and a painted mask and also by the way became a cult classic. As far as repeat viewing is not unexpected I think he made a typo. Another quote from Gumby-8 the only Fan: The acting is also a strong aspect of the film. With all due respect for the actors their performance is nothing more than the respective talent of Robert Napton. The catchy Tagline: Beware the hour between dusk and darkness That's because there is no dusk or darkness in this movie. MPAA rating Rated R for some violence/gore The only gore you see is some red paint on a sheet over a dead body you never see. As far as I know it might be a clump of grass. In summation I have seen horror flicks from the 50's 60's and 70's. I have seen what I thought to be the absolutely worst and some that were very good. The director of this film either did not make any attempt was asleep or took a hit of acid. Whatever the case I think the actors deserve applause for trying to salvage a very poor job of direction. I would give this film a rating of .5 for a 'B' movie. 
 Me and my friend rented this movie for $2.50. And we both agree on one thing: THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE! Also me and my friend counted 475 face shots. (Which makes up 95% of the movie). So in other words: DO SEE THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU LIKE WASTING MONEY! And I do! 
 I hated this movie so much I remember it vividly. It is not even funny. Any movie that relies on unfunny sex jokes and racism humor does not deserve the money it costs to make it. In the first half hour Rob Schneider drinks a carton of rancid milk. All I could think was he deserves it for making such a bad movie . Don't waste your time or money on this one. 
 This is not a horror film but a boring sex movie. A very bad movie to be avoided by any serious horror fan. No plot awful acting and annoying music. If you only watch the trailer you will know enough... It's a shame that such thing is available on VHS or video while there are so many good movies unavailable. If you like vampires try the Hammer Productions or the Italian Gothic from Mario Bava and Antonio Margheriti instead. Those are masterpieces if you compare this with this trash. Rating = even 1 is too much! And believe me I am not the only one with this opinion. 
 Considering the limits of this film (The entire movie in one setting - a music studio - only about 5 or 6 actors total) it should have been much better made. IF you have these limits in making a film how could the lighting be so bad? And the actors were terrible were talking a hair below the acting in Clerks except that was an enjoyable movie this had no substance. Well it tried to but really fails. It makes attempt to be self-referencing in a couple parts but the lines were delivered so poorly by the actors it was just bad. And the main character Neal guy what a pathetic looser. Clearly like 10 people total made this 'film' and they all knew each other and it probably was a real rock band that they had but unfortuntly these people really have no idea how terrible they are all around. This was made in 2005 but they all look so naieve it smacks of just pre-grunge era. Thankfully I didn't pay to see this (Starz on Demand delivers again!) but it was under the title The Possessed not Studio 666 it doesn't matter what you do to the title it can't help this. This could have been a much better made movie - there is no excuse for this bad film-making when you have the obvious limited parameters the filmmakers had when they made this working within those limits you should make the stuff you can control and the stuff you can work with the best you can. Instead they figured mediocrity would be good enough. And that music video wow that was bad I fast fowarded through that. So 2/10 is fair if you are into the whole b-movie crap I suppose you'll go and see this. 
 I cannot believe that they managed to spend US$17million on this film. Spectacularly bad acting egregious scripting and effects that you could do on your average PC unbelievable plot contrivances...a reporter who can get an inexperienced stewardess a major job at the UN? What? Not only that but the message of this film is so unsubtle that you come out feeling as if they've tried to batter you over the head with a full size crucifix. All this movie will do will preach to the choir and make everyone else laugh at such a ridiculous waste of money. If the makers of this film really wanted to sway people to christianity and show what it means to truly believe they would have used the money to help people truly in need. Now /that/ might have swayed some people into actually listening to them. 
 This was a disappointing movie. Considering the material---army life is always good for a laugh---and the stars this movie should have been a fall down laughfest. It was worth a couple of chuckles at best. Steve Martin has been much funnier than this and it appears that Dan Ackroyd should stick to dramatic roles where he might follow Robin Williams' lead and someday win an Oscar. 
 In my opinion this movie's title should be changed from Only the Brave to All About Lane . I went to a screening of this film a few months ago and was quite disappointed with the outcome. Although I appreciate that the director made a movie about the men of 442nd - a subject matter that long deserved addressing in the film industry - the acting in some parts of film was quite stale. The performances of Marc Dacascos Tamlyn Tomita and Jason Scott Lee were all great. However the director should have NEVER put himself as the main character in the movie. Sorry Lane you are just not a film actor. Stick to what you're good at - theater acting. Gina Hiraizumi's performance in this film was also horrible. She should never have been given a speaking role and her looks were unfit to play the part of a Miss Nisei queen. There were other young actresses in the film who were naturally beautiful and whose performances were wonderful... Why weren't they cast for that role? Another major problem with this film were its action sequences. The Japanese-American soldiers don't look like they were fighting German soldiers... let alone anyone. Granted this was a low budget feature but since this was a war-based film isn't it important to show some actually fighting? This film was a worthy attempt but definitely not worth a major distribution. 
 I wish Spike Lee had chosen a different title for his film. Summer Of Sam conveys the impression that the film is about the infamous serial killer David Berkowitz. It's not. It's a gritty earthy portrait of NYC street life during the hot summer of '77 when Berkowitz terrorized that city. The film follows several young fictional characters in an Italian-American neighborhood and their reactions to the Son of Sam threat. There's Vinny and his wife Dionna; there's Richie and Ruby and several other characters. The problem is that these characters are not likable. They are routinely annoying and at times unbearable. Lee then belabors their high energy chaotic lives which are filled with anger lust and general turmoil. There are at least two protracted fight scenes between Vinny and his wife redundant disco dance scenes countless gabfests ... Over and over I kept wondering: where's the film editor? Meanwhile with all that bulk the film passes up the chance to convey any real sense of fear or dread arising from the Son of Sam menace which is too much in the background. Lee is more successful at showing a different kind of menace that arising from neighborhood vigilante groups. The acting is uniformly good. That combined with 70's disco music and lavish attention to costumes and production design make you really feel like you are in an Italian-American neighborhood in NYC in 1977. The film's atmospheric authenticity however is not nearly enough to offset a rambling overblown script about the lives of grossly irritating people. 
 This movie was messed up. A sequel to John Carpenter's Vampires this didn't add up right. I'm not sure that I enjoyed this much. It was a little strange. Stick to the first Vampires it's a good movie. Vampires: Los Muetos wasn't a good attempt of a sequel. 4/10 
 This budget-starved Italian action/sci-fi hybrid features David Warbeck as a Miami reporter who is chosen by the ghosts of the people of Atlantis (!) to stop an evil businessman (Academy Award nominee John Ireland) from using a telepathic fetus grown using spores from an asteroid to rule the world. You got all that? Despite such a loopy plot this is actually quite a bore and the RAIDERS OF ATLANTIS sneers at it with contempt. Honestly the most (intentionally) creative thing about this flick is the slight reworking of Herbie Hancock's BEVERLY HILLS COP theme for the opening titles. The most unintentionally creative bit involves a scene in a lab that is inexplicably shown twice back-to-back. Perhaps director Alberto De Martino wanted to get all avant garde on us in the twilight of his career? I was going to declare this Ireland's worst film on his resume but then I saw SATAN'S CHEERLEADERS was listed on there. I would also like to safely declare that I am probably the only person in the history of the world to do a double feature of this and Hitchcock's VERTIGO. 
 Maybe I'm really getting old but this one just missed me and the old Funny Bone completely. Surely there must be something powerful wrong with this Irishman (that's me Schultz!). Lordy lordy what I would give to see the light! Firstly that Phil Silvers manic energy wit and drive was very much a part of the comedic upbringing and overall education in life if you will. Although it is possible that the series first titled: YOU'LL NEVER GET RICH (1955-59*) could have gotten on the CBS TV Network with someone else in the title role of Sgt. Bilko it is very hard to picture any other Actor/Comedian in the business wearing those Master Sergeant's stripes. Such a strong identification is inescapable though not the same sort of career-wrecking typecasting of a nightmare that it proved to be to some other guys like Clayton More( THE LONE RANGER ) George Reeves ( THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN ) and Charles Nelson Riley ( UNCLE CROC'S BLOCK ). One major stumbling block to successfully adapting and updating such a work from the 1950's TV Screen to the 1990's Movie-going public is our collective memory. Without being sure about what percentage of the crowd remembered the Bilko character from seeing the original run and early syndication revivals and their numbers were surely considerable; even a large segment of the young had seen Bilko reruns in recent times. It was obvious that the new film and the source were miles; or even light years apart. So as not to be thought of as a totally square old grouch please let's consider some other points. Right here today the 14th Day of November In The Year of Our Lord 2007 let me swear and affirm under Oath that I have been a Steve Martin fan for nearly 30 years Furthermore I've enjoyed the wit and talents of Bilko '96 Co-Stars Dan Akroyd and the Late Phil Hartman. After all it was the talents of guys like this and so many others Alumni of NBC;s Saturday NIGHT and SECOND CITY TV that kept the last quarter of the 20th Century laughing. But a BILKO re-make; it just didn't click. Perhaps if the film had been made as a Service Comedy (always liked 'em!) but without the Bilko Show names and gave it some identity of it self it would be more highly regarded by crabby old guys like me. So we've already had so many sitcom and cartoon series turned into movies lately what's next? Howse about somebody doing Hal Roach's World War II Army Comedy Series of Sergeants DOUBLEDAY & AMES and TV's 1st Cartoon Series CRUSADER RABBIT ? Remember where you heard it first! POODLE SCHNITZ! 
 Adrianne should really get a life-without Mr. Brady . She nauseates me and has been one of the main reasons why I know longer tune in to the show. It's pretty brainless show and every little argument or disagreement seems to be put under the scope and analyzed to death. This makes them look/sound they are anything but ready for marriage and yet I know these disagreements are all part of life. I guess to some people this is entertainment. If this happens to fall into next season I will feel sorry for anyone who has nothing better to do with their life but watch this trash. Though I would not be terribly surprised. can't even stand the commercials for this show anymore! I hope they're getting enough money to constantly embarrass themselves in front of a camera week after week. However the A girl has one heck of great butt! 
 What we have here is a film about how the pursuit of money & revenge can corrupt your soul... or something like that. Guy Ritchie a director known for his reworking of the gangster genre bites off more than he can chew with this one. His use of modern film noir to tackle the theme of a man setting himself free by swallowing his pride being nice to his enemy & giving away all his money falls flat on it's face. When Jason Statham's character no longer fears Ray Liotta it apparently drives Liotta crazy enough to blow his head off in the final scene. Why? Basically you cannot set up a mafiosi like the Liotta character who has presumably got to his station in life by displaying the kind of ruthless behaviour evident throughout the film only then to have him driven to suicide by nothing more than a pitying smile on the face of Statham's character. Before anyone starts to say I'm missing the point... I'm not. I get it OK? Opt out of the quest for riches & you'll find true happiness and inner peace. Be nice to your enemy and this will confuse him into self-destruction. This seems to be the gist of the movie and in itself this is not a bad premise for a story although hardly original. The problem is that Ritchie simply doesn't have the skill as a movie maker to carry it off. At the moment when even Guy Ritchie realises this he appears to get bored with the story and begins to insert red-herrings: The scene when Statham gets knocked over by a car - Why? The shooting of some scenes as Marvel comic animations... again why? There are so many loose threads & unanswered questions left at the end of the movie you could get all 2001-ish about it and try figuring them out or simply accept that there are no answers & each viewer will interpret things in their own way. Myself? I was so bored with the pompous tone of the film that I simply didn't care. Frankly the ending couldn't come too soon so that I didn't have to sit through any more of this pretentious psychobabble. A waste of two hours of my life. 
 What an unusual movie. Absolutely no concessions are made to Hollywood special effects or entertainment. There is no background music not special effects or enhanced sound. Facial expressions are usually covered by thick beards and the Spanish language is a strange monotonic lilt that sounds the same whether in the midst of a battle or talking around a campfire. I sort of viewed these movies (parts 1 and 2) as an educational experience not really something to go and get entertained by. Its quite long and in places dull. But I suspect that given the lack of any plot development I don't think its very educational either. Its also difficult to perceive any story from the movie dialogue - it would be a good idea to read up a little on the history so that you can understand the context of what is happening since for some reason the director didn't see fit to inform the audience why Che's band was moving around the way they did - as a result there seem to be groups skulking around the woodland for no particular reason and getting shot at. I would have loved to give this movie more stars for somehow generating more empathy with me and developing depth of character but somehow all of the characters were still strangers to me at the end. The stars it gets are for realism and showing the hardships of guerrilla warfare. 
 Who actually created this piece of crap this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life it is such a waste of time and money. I hate it how they create low budget sequels featuring D-Lister actors and a storyline so similar to the 1st one. I found this movie in the bargain bin sitting right next to Wild Things 2 and Death To The Supermodels for $2.99 what a fool i was to actually think that this could be good instead i watched in disgust as poor acting stereotypes ripped of the storyline and script from the 1st one. Whoever thought that this straight-to-video production was actually even a half decent film you must be on crackd or something because I think what pretty much most of the people who've seen this film thinks WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP!!!! 
 The comparison is perhaps unfair but inevitable. Those attracted to the intimacy and depth of Umbrellas will be slightly horrified to discover a cut-and-paste musical in the American style - awkward stilted dialogue with inexplicable song-and-dance numbers. Gene Kelly's French accent was apparently so poor that a dreadful job of dubbing was substituted (as you'll remember the dubbing was almost perfectly pulled off in Umbrellas). The translation of the French (for subtitled versions) as well leaves something to be desired although this can't be attributed to Demy. The film also has several self-aware moments that come off a wee disconcerting such as references in songs to LeGrand himself. And the costumes - well the tight pants/white boots combination and the freakishly unnatural colors reminds one of an Austin Powers film . . . But Demy does reward the viewer with allusions to Umbrellas; note for instance the suitcase carried by Maxence in his departure from Rochefort - this is the same suitcase carried by Guy in his departure from Cherbourg. Also note the Convenient Brunette of Resolution - Madeleine in Umbrellas and Josette in Young Girls. Generally speaking those expecting the natural feel of Umbrellas (save the floating bicycle scene) or looking for similar deeper questions and ambiguous endings as in Umbrella's script should probably pass this one b y. Those looking for a French version of a thin '60s American musical will be quite happy. 
 Wow I knew this film was going to be bad but not this bad. Spoilerific comments ensue. Roddy Roddy Piper is sickly sweet retired cop (cliche!) helping out everyone - smiling like a post-op lobotomy patient through-out and lamenting over his dead son. His adopted son returns from Armed Forces Special Ops and because he's seen things - portrayed by clenching his teeth if anyone mentions anything about the past. Time to clean up the streets from another guy who once knew Piper and his dead son (who the bad lad killed) and his adopted son. Oh the love interest is a pretty young lady who decides for no reason that she wants to jump the bones of the ex-Army bloke. This happens in about 2 minutes of 1 scene. The action could have saved this film but it's even worse than the storyline and acting. It's all been done before it's all been done much much better (Ong-Bak is a prime example). This is the worst film I've ever seen - and I've seen Waterworld twice. Erm the film is called HONOR (Spelt Wrong for the Americans) and the tag line has from the makers of Bloodsport and Kickboxer - check out Director David Worths other films and you'll soon realise why they put these 2 films on there even though they are over 10 years old. Such classics as Shark Attack 3: Megalodon - says it all really. I'll give you 10 if you don't go to see this film. PS - Apologise for not know character names tells you something though. 
 This film looked interesting; I'd read the book a number of years ago and it informed me that the feature followed the plot outline pretty tightly. Started watching it and almost from the outset it failed to live up to expectations. In fact I didn't bother watching the whole thing... utter drivel - bad performances bad acting and instantly dislikeable characters - that was the point of the film I guess. Watching this film left a bad taste in the mouth and put me on a downer for the remainder of my weekend. Do not bother with this feature. 
 I saw the original Chorus Line on Broadway God knows how many times and felt the passion despair and joy come from this live experience in the theater. Michael Bennett knew he would have to re-imagine Chorus for the screen but could never figure out how to do it. If the man who came up with the show is stumped - that should answer your question. There are some shows that are simply made to be seen live - with an audience. However Richard Attenborough fresh of the musical work of Ghandi and dancing with animals in Doctor Doolittle ended up directing this film which bore little to no resemblance to the stage show. Horrible songs were added (Surprise! Surprise!) great songs were dropped or given to other characters (which didn't make sense). Michael Douglas was mis-cast. People that couldn't dance tried to act and there was the sexy Landers woman who couldn't sing act or dance - I guess she had just finished being Ghandi's wife. The dances by Jeffrey Hornaday look like nothing more than schlock from Flashdance rejects and nothing works. I sat there stunned at how something so riveting and emotional could be drained to nothing. If you truly love this show and it is coming back to Broadway in 2006 - see it but don't think that the long running musical event that was A Chorus Line has any thing at all to do with this film. 
 Yet another insult and slap in the face to gay men everywhere. This lame attempt at a comedy has nothing to recommend it. Once again we have an attractive 'straight' hero who supposedly can't get any woman to be interested in him. Yeah right! And we're also presented with the 'sympathetic attractive' gay friend who is actually a fat balding ugly old man whom the lead is supposed to find attractive. Even I didn't find him appealing and I'm a fat ugly old gay man (but thankfully not balding)! Whatever acting talent there may be here has been thrown away on a bad script and truly awful direction. Mr. Sneedeker should be banned from filmdom but then he's no different than the countless other hacks working in Hollyweed. 
 Nothing like a movie about a group of friends who not only all dislike each other to the point of loathing but they have little to no redeeming qualities to make an *audience* like or empathize with any of the characters either. There are movies so bad they are good (a la Ed Wood or Tod Slaughter films) and there's just plain bad (like 99% of Uwe Boll's work ). This film is barely tolerable even if you are a brilliantly talented MSTie riffer (e.g. Mystery Science Theatre 3000). Thankfully while I am rather talented in that regard (it's how my mind works All The Time) for those who are not so naturally talented in MSTie riffing eventually into *this* film you'll just want to pull your own head off painfully aware the movie Taboo robs you of about an hour and twenty minutes you'll never get back. Even my MSTie talents were barely a match for this slow paced boring waste of time. The most puzzling aspect of this film is that *someone* green-lit and/or funded it... I rented Taboo solely for the normally talented Amber Benson who clearly must have been blackmailed into doing this film. I've another lesser known film of hers in my rental queue the reviews to which I'd better read first. Ironically the best aspect of the film was its impressive labyrinthine mansion for its interior location. 
 This is a truly terrible film. I'm only writing this so that some people somewhere are put off watching it. If I have stopped one person from wasting some of their precious life watching this film I shall die happy. Unutterably dull although since it stars Al Pacino I was fooled into thinking that at any moment something interesting was going to happen. Then the credits rolled and I realised I had been completely fooled into watching this unbelievable drivel. I cannot believe that this film has achieved as high a score as it has at IMDb (over 5 stars when I last saw the voting). Are you people voting ironically? Please please please do not watch this film! 
 This had a great cast with big-name stars like Tyrone Power Henry Fonda Randolph Scott Nancy Kelly Henry Hull and Brian Donlevey and a bunch more lesser-but-known names with shorter roles. It also had Technicolor one of the few movies made with it in 1939. Now the bad news.......regrettably I can't say much positive for the story. It portrayed the James boys in a totally positive light....and Hollywood has done that ever since. Why these criminals are always shown to be the good guys is beyond me. This film glamorizes them and made their enemies - the railroad people - into vicious human beings. The latter was exaggerated so much it was preposterous. Well that's the film world for you: evil is good; good is bad. Hey Hollywood: here's a news flash - The James boys were criminals! Really - look it up! 
 i usually don't write reviews but i can't understand why this is rated so high and wanted to give a warning to horror lovers since i can only assume that all those high ratings were given by average TV watchers. i have only watched the first two episodes but those two were so clich it wasn't even funny any more. the same old stories you've probably seen/read a couple of times already - living toys evil things from other dimensions... and it's not just that these stories aren't innovative they are also pretty bad versions of those clichs. i'd prefer e.g. chucky and silent hill over those two episodes anytime. and don't even ask about the visual effects... the ones in the first episode are alright but the ones in the second... awful. looks like some film student's project gone wrong. blood... or gore... erm... nothing worth mentioning. it might be interesting for some ten year old kid who probably hasn't seen/read that many scary stories yet (although i'd rather recommend beyond belief - now that's what i call a decent mystery TV show). but for an adult horror fan this is worthless. i only gave the 3 points because there is in fact some beautiful cinematography (especially in the second episode) and some nice acting. 
 I think scarecrows are creepy so it's a pity this movie doesn't make more of them. A bunch of robbers do an emergency parachute from a plane into a enormous field with scarecrows. One of them goes missing with the loot and so the rest chase him down while being set upon by inexplicably evil scarecrows. The acting is hammy and the scarecrows unimpressive (when they move). On the positive side the director does get some suspense out of the static scarecrows. It is as Alfred Hitchcock says A bomb under a table goes off and that's surprise. We know the bomb is under the table but not when it will go off and that's suspense.  
 step aside for hollywood veterans? (the wayan brothers were 'asked') thats what hollyweird demanded and thats what it got. However like so many of its recent decisions this one was a stupendous mistake. The director is SO out of touch with todays audience attempting to bring back physical pratfalls and gags in place of funny dialogue is just a DISASTER. I knew it the audience knew it and the CAST knew it. What a shame why did they EVER consider changing directors? Not only that but the two Wayan brothers played as two of four primary characters without them its just a farce and a sad one. SP 
 It's 1982 Two years after the Iranian Embassy Siege which involved the dramatic SAS Rescue from the Balconys and with a War with Argentina over the Falkland Islands currently taking place what better film to make than a Gung-Ho SAS Film that re-creates the Iranian Hostage siege whilst using Britains Number one action hero of the day Lewis Collins. throw in Edward Woodward and a few other Well known actors and you've got a winner on your hands?...Well maybe not! The film itself doesn't make the situation serious enough whilst the acting is quite second rate. it's like a Movie long episode of The Professionals but without the formula. This film goes nowhere fast and is quite predictable. Maybe Cubby Brocoli watched this film and decided to ditch Lewis Collins as a Touted James Bond Replacement for Roger Moore. Watch it if your a fan of Lewis Collins or SAS stuff in General if not save your time. 
 There's enough star power in THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS to create another galaxy yet the final product is pretty debatable. The film and its messages are very noble and I think perhaps most would agree with them. (Liberal Democracy good violent fascist regime bad; open-mindedness good racism bad etc). Unfortunately we're battered from head to toe with these and as much subtlety is used as I've described them. Ultimately we are left watching very noble people without any flaws squaring off with nasty cretins who have no redeeming qualities. It radiates with all the suspense of a badly orchestrated pro wrestling match. Jeremy Irons plays the patron a man of many contradictions. Meryl Streep as his gifted bride and Glenn Close as her sister in law. When the camera stays with these folks the movie tends to move and is quite enjoyable. Unfortunately THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS engages with simply way too many subplots and characters pop up and out of the picture like shooting gallery targets. We don't get to know them hence we don't get to care for them. The result is boredom. If Bille August the director and screenwriter (from Isabel Allende's book) had either lengthened the film or snipped a few characters this film might have worked completely. As it stands it was a nice try with nice messages and a bonecrushing yawnfest. Not recommended. 
 I have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago and one thing surprised me so negatively that I could not see any redeeming virtues in the movies: Dennis Quaid was cast as a policeman that never smiles or grin while his smile and grin are two of his trademarks. Danny Glover was cast as the bad guy but - again - most viewers' imagination could not go far enough as to believe him in that role. Also Jared Leto was not believable as the former medicine student. The tension was just not there since the killer was known very early. The finale was again neither dramatic nor tense: nobody around me cared about what was going to happen next. All we could wait for was the end of the movie. All in all a disappointing evening spent at the cinema. 
 Leslie Sands' stilted play Deadlock becomes a poor-choice vehicle for Bette Davis and Gary Merrill just after their joint-success in All About Eve . After killing her spouse a scheming woman is visited by her husband's best friend who passes himself off as her husband once others begin stopping by the house. Irving Rapper one of Bette's best directors from her peak years is sadly unable to elevate this ridiculous material in which Davis is curiously aloof and restrained until the outrageous finale (where she thankfully pulls out all the stops). Production and supporting cast strictly second-rate; only for Bette Davis completists. *1/2 from **** 
 This movie is a perfect adaptation of the English Flick Unfaithful. Ashmit plays the role of Richard Gere Emran that of Olivier and Malikka the perfect cheating wife role of Lane.They have changed the second half of the film to adapt for the Indian masses. Even then the movie has got the full traces of Unfaithful though it couldn't catch up with the original. It was a cheap soft porn of the Bollywood lovers where Mallika showed a lot more skin than anyone dared to show. Emran did more roles like this and was even nicknamed the serial killer. In the future if the Indian Directors plan to remake a English movie then they have to look into the feasibility of the plot with the Indian Censors. Though the film bombed at the box office the actors got the undue recognition. In future the directors should be a little more careful in remaking a Oscar nominated film. All said this is not a family film so take the extra caution while watching it at home with family. 
 When an attempt is made to assassinate the Emir of Ohtar an Arab potentate visiting Washington D.C. his life is saved by a cocktail waitress named Sunny Davis. Sunny becomes a national heroine and media celebrity and as a reward is offered a job working for the Protocol Section of the United States Department of State. Unknown to her however the State Department officials who offer her the job have a hidden agenda. A map we see shows Ohtar lying on the borders of Saudi Arabia and South Yemen in an area of barren desert known as the Rub al-Khali or Empty Quarter. In real life a state in this location would have a population of virtually zero and virtually zero strategic value but for the purposes of the film we have to accept that Ohtar is of immense strategic importance in the Cold War and that the American government who are keen to build a military base there need to do all that they can in order to keep on the good side of its ruler. It transpires that the Emir has taken a fancy to the attractive young woman who saved him and he has reached a deal with the State Department; they can have their base provided that he can have Sunny as the latest addition to his harem. Sunny's new job is just a ruse to ensure that the Emir has further opportunities to meet her. A plot like this could have been the occasion for some hilarious satire but in fact the film's satirical content is rather toned down. Possibly in 1984 the American public were not in the mood for trenchant satire on their country's foreign policy; this was after all the year in which Ronald Reagan carried forty-nine out of fifty states in the Presidential election and his hard line with the Soviet Union was clearly going down well with the voters. (If the film had been made a couple of years later in the wake of the Iran/Contra affair its tone might have been different). The film is not so much a satire as a vehicle for Goldie Hawn to show off her brand of cuteness and charm. Sunny is a typical Goldie character- pretty sweet-natured naive and not too bright. There is however a limit to how far you can go with cuteness and charm alone and you cannot automatically make a bad film a good one just by making the leading character a dumb blonde. (Actually that sounds more like a recipe for making a good film a bad one). Goldie tries her best to save this one but never succeeds. Part of the reason is the inconsistent way in which her character is portrayed. On the one hand Sunny is a sweet innocent country girl from Oregon. On the other hand she is a 35-year-old woman who works in a sleazy bar and wears a revealing costume. The effect is rather like imagining Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm grown up and working as a Bunny Girl. The more important reason why Goldie is unable to rescue this film is even the best comedian or comedienne is no better than his/her material and Protocol is simply unfunny. Whatever humour exists is tired and strained relying on offensive stereotypes about Arab men who apparently all lust after Western women particularly if they are blonde and blue-eyed. There was a lot of this sort of thing about in the mid-eighties as this was the period which also saw the awful Ben Kingsley/ Nastassia Kinski film Harem about a lascivious Middle Eastern ruler who kidnaps a young American woman and the mini-series of the same name which told a virtually identical story with a period setting. The film-makers seem to have realised that their film would not work as a pure comedy because towards the end it turns into a sort of latter-day Mr Smith Goes to Washington . Sunny turns from a blonde bimbo into a fount of political wisdom and starts uttering all sorts of platitudes about Democracy and the Constitution and the Citizen's Duty to Vote and We The People and how the Price of Liberty is Eternal Vigilance blah blah blah?? but in truth the film is no more successful as a political parable than it is as a comedy. Goldie Hawn has made a number of good comedies such as Cactus Flower Overboard and Housesitter but Protocol is not one of them. I have not seen all of her films but of those I have seen this dire comedy is by far the worst. 3/10 
 Magnolia presents itself as a wall to wall canvas of screaming shrieking overwrought hysterical twits who are all bedeviled by regret guilt and pain. PT Anderson is certainly a gifted filmmaker but perhaps he should leave the writing to someone else or at least find someone with the balls to tell him he needed to edit this overlong mess. A look at the cast will tell you that the performances were excellent and they were. I just wish that every scene didn't involve an over the top shouting match or long digression into the sins that have been committed and the pain that they have caused. I also think that Anderson fails miserably to create a story that parallels the bizarre tableaus that open the film. The opening sequences are wonderful in showing how fate can bring together people and circumstances that even the most optimistic believer in a cosmic puppeteer pulling our strings would scoff at. But the story that then develops lacks any of the stuff that these opening fables display. I kept waiting for some form of cosmic convergence to display itself but instead all we get is waves of regret from morally challenged characters who see their past spread out before them and now seek absolution. Throw in an out of left field biblical plague near the end and all you end up with is a cadre of Anderson devotees who will marvel at his genius when all it really proves is that he has actually read the Old Testament. I will say that the music by Aimee Mann was great and I'll be looking for the Soundtrack CD. In short a good movie to look at and listen to (the music that is) if the actors would have shut up or toned it down it may have been 
 This is an extremely boring film. If you grew up during the Vietnam Was as I did then you've seen and heard all of the film footage and arguments here a hundred times by now. But what really makes this film boring is the narration by director Carlton Sherwood. The majority of the film is shot with Sherwood talking directly into the camera about his opinion of this conflicting time in the history of our nation. If you're old enough to remember Vietnam then you won't find anything new here. There is no new evidence to condemn John Kerry or new evidence worthy of another documentary on Vietnam. Younger viewers who are interested in the subject should see George Butler's excellent film Going Upriver! Stolen Honor was clearly meant to be a hatchet job on John Kerry but it fails miserably at accomplishing that goal. 
 I've seen the movie only recently although it appeared in 2001. I hoped to see an entertaining movie but let me tell you Princess Blade is nothing compared to Azumi. The princess is not very talkative as you may have noticed... She reminded me of Jean Claude Van Damme who only stared to make his point then beat the crap out of the opponents. During the entire movie I waited to hear at least a confession about what she liked why was she fighting who did she love and trust. I waited in vain. Crappy movie. Crappy dialog. Don't watch it unless you want to be bored out of your minds! It's so bad that in the end I was wondering how I managed not to scream in frustration 1 and a half hour. Approximately. I give a 4/10. 
 As an engineer I must say this show's first season started out very promising. Most of the applied mathematics were somewhat plausible and the relationships portrayed between the Eppes brothers and father gave the show an interesting edge. But after the first season the show started degrading heavily. Most of the mathematics and technology used in crime solving is now utter gibberish and very laughable to all people involved in science & technology for real. The involvement from the actors still feels okay and I can imagine a fair amount of money is still going into producing each episode but in the end this has degraded to a very unpleasantly tasting dish which is a mix of a grade C action thriller and CSI style cop show. If you are gonna watch it go for only the first season and possibly parts of the second. Thereafter I would not waste my time. Myself I gave the show up midway through season 3. Season 1 - 8 stars Season 2 - 5 stars Season 3 - 3 stars Let's sum that up to 4 stars. Since Charlie doesn't know his math anymore I won't bother with the correctness of mine either. 
 This is a wonderfully goofy example of a self produced written and directed vanity project ...while I was working as a crew member John Carradine commented to me (before the burning at the stake sequence): This is the worst piece of sh*t I've ever worked on ...and I've worked on a lot of pieces of sh*t. Also An interesting moment earlier when Jim Mitchum was having trouble with his lines and started cursing in the courtyard location of the Santuario (a religious shrine in Chimay) - at which point one of the local vato loco low-rider onlookers growled ...show some respect man which apparently caused Jim to remember where he was as he then made a very profound and heartfelt apology for his inappropriate behavior. In any case the crew did the job on deferment and were never fully paid - but came away with plenty of particularly bizarre stories - like the night we caught the producer/director's 10 year old son entertaining himself by constructing miniature Burmese tiger traps for us to break our legs in. Like they say: Ya gotta' love the Biz...  
 Sadly it's true. Legiunea str?in? exposes with absolute clarity the parameters of Daneliuc's irreversible failure. As it was already said the author lost the faculty to coalesce his content factors and artistic intentions in a coherent form. Maniacally concerned with the mechanic trick of picking at random news subjects and join them together without any legitimacy he only gathers a disordered pile of events unable to follow the least story-line. The script's level is similar to a Cantarea Romaniei amateur play about the glorious feats of socialist realism - only turned upside down: while the communist line dictated a narrow concern only with positivism and sugary festivism now Daneliuc is as perniciously obsessed only with negativism and disgusting scatology. The ideas content is zero and the message infantile and didactic at a kindergarten level. Unfortunately he also forgot the most elementary professional tenets. He isn't able anymore to organize a dramatic situation to order it in a correct movie scene to frame it right and to edit it following the simplest rules of cinematographic grammar. His level of story-telling in film-images is similar to phrasing something like: Holy sheet man it ain't nuthin right 'ere and all da people is asses! What a huge distance from the impressive artist of 1976-1984 who had created unique works as Cursa Proba de microfon Van?toarea de vulpi - and even Croaziera and Glissando ... Sic transit gloria mundi... 
 Most definitely the worst Columbo ever dreamt up. No murder and the abandonment of the tried and tested formula makes this a real drag. Falk looks bored throughout and so will you be if you waste anytime watching this. 
 Disney's done it again. The company that made Mr. Magoo and George of the Jungle has made another movie that barely resembles the cartoon on which it is based and keeps none of the spirit of the original. Inspector Gadget was one of my favorite cartoons when I was a young one and for a movie of it to exist may have been a dream come true back then. Now that that movie does exist I was severely disappointed even outraged. First we have the characters. Gadget himself has the gadgets that made him such a fun character in the original cartoon (with well-done special effects accompanying them) and he even has some of the naivete of the original Gadget but he is now more competent and is expected to solve the crime himself while Penny and Brain just watch. Penny has little to do; while she played a major role in the cartoon discovering the crime and halting it and occasionally getting captured by the MAD agents now she is simply introduced and then forgotten although she does at least sneak into Claw's base. Claw is the movie's version of Dr. Claw who was a rather sinister raspy-voiced man who wore metallic gloves and sat in his chair his face hidden from view as he stroked his cat and oversaw various crimes. Now he is simply a man with a claw for a hand with no mystery behind the character. Brain and Mad Cat exist in the movie but are rather insignificant to it. Even small parts of the cartoon aren't spared in this butchering. The famous expression Wowsers! was mysteriously changed to Wowser and Gadget's Gadgetmobile now looks different and talks. There is even product endorsements everywhere. Why is Yahoo! advertised on a sign? Why does the Gadgetmobile have buttons for M&M's or Skittles? Fans of the cartoon will hate it others might will likely find the movie below par and when all is said and done this movie is another attempt to make some quick bucks off another old show. 
 he was my hero for all time until he went along with {if you can call it a movie} I went to the show to watch it and come out and not just asking for me money back but asked for double the money thats how bad my hero's acting and the hole thing was.............I can't believe that Steven Segal's career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4th rate films with 5th rate secondary actors. I watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does. When he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong. The plot is unbelievable as a movie and even if you excuse the visuals and had read this story as a novel you'd be left wondering why you had even picked up the book. Steven Segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation. He shows no effort and no enthusiasm and in some scenes he doesn't show up at all. I hate to repeat other peoples comments but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic. The condition of those scenes chopped in is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time. The zappruder film showing President John F Kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner. My honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds. I read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget (Segal being paid 5 of that) and that the movie still came in under budget. I must concur. It is no wonder that this is a direct to DVD movie as no conscientious theater owner would play this movie . 
 The Deadly Wake is THE PERFECT MOVIE for film students... to learn how NOT to make a film! Let's see... what did the crew mess up in this flick? Worst music mix Worst editing Worst script WORST ALL-TIME DIRECTING Worst acting Worst choreography Worst cinematography Worst props Worst sets Worst lighting Etc. Let's face it if this film had been in ultra-high contrast black-and-white AND silent... it still would have been awful. All scenes are dark (lighting people call it black ) often the music score drowned out the meandering dialogs which was OK because nobody ever spoke two whole sentences without long pauses for effect. The evil robot was hilarious... what was that? Jazz dancing? Oh... I guess it was supposed to be walking tactically or something. I'm sure it struck fear into the hearts... of the poor editors. And how do you edit so much footage of garbage? Not possible. Garbage is garbage no matter how you splice it. How did anyone ever get this thru the dailys??? Bottom line is- I couldn't stand to watch more than 15-minute segments it was so bad... but I did see the whole thing (with lotsa breaks) just to see if it had ANY good parts in it at all. NOPE! NONE! A perfect example of how not to make a flick... a must see for EVERY serious film student!!! 
 I went to see this film based on the review by Siskel and Ebert; not only did I get duped but I took some friends along and had to spend the rest of the day profusely apologizing for making them sit through this pointless crap. After this I never went to see a movie based solely on Siskel & Ebert's advice. 
 Mario Lewis of the Competitive Enterprise Institute has written a definitive 120-page point-by-point line-by-line refutation of this mendacious film which should be titled A CONVENIENT LIE. The website address where his debunking report which is titled A SKEPTIC'S GUIDE TO AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH can be found at is :www.cei.org. A shorter 10-page version can be found at: www.cei.org/pdf/5539.pdf Once you read those demolitions you'll realize that alleged global warming is no more real or dangerous than the Y2K scare of 1999 which Gore also endorsed as he did the pseudo-scientific film THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW which was based on a book written by alleged UFO abductee Whitley Strieber. As James The Amazing Randi does to psychics and Philip Klass does to UFOs and Gerald Posner does to JFK conspir-idiocy theories so does Mario Lewis does to Al Gore's movie and the whole global warming scam. 
 Dr Tarr's Torture Dungeon is about a journalist who travels to an insane asylum to write about a new technique they use with their patients. However the journalist soon finds out that things are not what they seem to be and the asylum is being run by the patients and the doctors are in cages. First of all some parts of the film are just plain boring and just makes you want to fall asleep and the interesting parts are interesting for all the wrong reasons(A guy who thinks he's a chicken for instance). I have to admit that the story is actually pretty good but the film itself bombs. The music of the film is really odd and like something you would hear in some insane comedy and yes there is a scene involving dancing chicken men which pretty much made me want to shut off the screen. Watch this film at your own risk! Rated: R for Violence and Nudity. 
 Saw this 'film' recently and have to say it was the worst attempt at film making I have ever had the misfortune to see. What the Hell was going on with Coolio? Totally unprovoked shooting at people in distress. Totally uninvolving slow tedious and detached. Worse than Spawn. long live Evil dead II . 
 Well I don't know where to begin. Obviously this was a made for TV movie so my expectations were low. I was pleasantly surprised by the overall direction of the second hour but anything before or after that seemed to be a paint by the numbers sort of movie. And talk about bad chemistry between the tow lovebird detectives. .. I would go more in depth but this movie doesn't really deserve it. Grade: D+ (IMDB rating 3/10) 
 I had the greatest enthusiasm going in to the advance screening for this movie. After all this is one of the oldest and most complex tales known to mankind and it was one of the first epic tales I read as a kid (even before Tolkien). I must say that IT WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. They completely made the plot into a joke and turned the thing into one long soap opera. The elements that WERE faithful to the plot were sprinkled throughout in such a haphazard manner that the audience was laughing at many times at the silly script that just paid lip service to this battle of all battles. It was a huge disappointment to see a complex character like Achilles (who has a strange combination of nearly Matrix-like powers utter ruthlessness and male lovers in the original poem) turn to Fabio on the beach in the guise of Pitt (who with a good script and more effort could have turned this into the most complex and original warrior figure Hollywood has ever produced). The actors were actually decent trying to make the best of a ridiculous script. It was actually a waste of so much talent (Peter O'Toole stole the show and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic). Compare it to LOTR or Gladiator and it doesn't even hold a candle to them. Plenty of hunks for the ladies to goggle over but not enough battle scenes for a movie that is about one long battle and siege. I wouldn't recommend that anyone pay to see this story dragged through the dirt like one of the characters was (at least they got that part right). 
 Usually I love Lesbian movies even when they are not very good. I'm biased I guess! But this one is just the pits. Yes the scenery and the buildings are beautiful and there is a brief but beautiful erotic interlude but otherwise this movie is just a complete waste of time. Annamarie alternates between sulking and getting high/stoned/passing out on whatever drug or booze is handy and Ella inexplicably puts up with this abominable behavior through the entire movie. At no time are we given any insight into why this is so or even why Annamarie is so depressed and withdrawn. If there had at least been some kind of closure in the (potentially romantic? we don't even know!) relationship between the two there might have been some kind of satisfaction. But although Annamarie at one point asks Ella why do you love me? Ella doesn't even acknowledge this. It's never really clear whether this is anything more than an (ill-behaved) Lesbian on a boring road trip with a straight woman. Even the interactions between the two women and the local people they meet on the journey which could have been lively and informative are instead flat tedious and mostly incomprehensible. There is one good joke in the movie although I'm sure it was unintentional. The women travel in a two-seat Ford coupe with a middling sized trunk. Yet when they set up camp they have an enormous tent cots sleeping gear and even a table chair and typewriter! On top of that when they board a ferry we see piles of luggage presumably theirs presumably also carried in the little Ford's trunk! And through the entire film we never see one gas station or anywhere that looks like it would actually have any place to buy gasoline. Mostly they travel through endless miles of desolate desert. So where did they get fuel? There may not be too many Lesbian films out there good or bad but there are plenty that are better than this and very few that are worse. Leave this one in the rack. 
 The Good Earth follows the life a slave girl and a poor farmer in China. The movie is based on the novel by Pearl S. Buck. The story is great but I hated that they decided to cast Anglos in the lead roles. Walter Connolly is laughable as the farmer's father. He has such a heavy American accent as do most of the lead actors that I could not bear listening to him speak. It is a shame that Hollywood could not get past their racist beliefs to cast Asians in the lead roles. To take Anglos and make them look like Chinese is akin to Anglos putting shoe polish on their faces to play African-Americans. 
 Although Robert Knox Benfer has his fans I'm not one of them. His films are asinine and amateurish and and just not very funny unless you're a 14 year old with an underdeveloped sense of humor. He's certainly not famous as him immature fans would like you to believe by harassing people at Wikipedia or stuffing the ratings votes here at the IMDb. He's certainly not been profiled by any major media outlets which speaks volumes about his and his creation's fame . Benfer does have some slight skill at limited animation but he needs to get away from his young sycophants and learn to write some actual funny material before he'll be taken seriously as a real entertainer. As of this moment though he's just a kid with a camera and it shows. 
 For 50 years after world war 2 the United States was in a state where key segments of the economy were dominated by military interests. At the same time because of the draft and wars everyone in society had served or was connected to someone who had. This allowed for a minigenre based on the notion of American cleverness in the midst of an inflexible military machine. Sometimes that machine was non-US military for example in prisoner of war situations. Once removed are stories in other machines: science fiction and corporate but they always reference this military genre and indeed the testosterone shots of action even reference their comic sibling. You can trace it I think perhaps starting in the comic meaning Amrican sections of The Great Escape which immediately spawned TeeVee offspring in Gomer Pyle and Hogan's Heros. Then a second wave triggered by Catch 22 and MASH both of which had been real life then books then movies and in the MASH case then TeeVee. But before all that there was the Phil Silvers Show about a Sergeant Bilko and this followed from Mister Roberts. A happy con man who only committed harmless crimes and then only as response to an overly crude system which attempted to limit his life. This was in the day when TeeVee shows mattered. You absorbed them instead of merely carrying them to work to chatter about. It wasn't particularly clever in any way except in finding that crack between what we wanted in control and freedom. Its one large zone where Americans worked out how they think about forgivable even endearing lies in a military context a zone that has been appropriated by one of our political parties here. Because its big it sometimes pays off in laughs. Stripes was pretty darn funny I thought. It had the twist of the misfits actually defeating serious foes sort of folding in some Dirty Dozen. And sexual adventure. Now this well before the cultural wars escalated. It tries to touch that sweet spot like other remakes that manhandled Steve Martin. It is so unfunny you actually root for the Army to be the stronger player. Yet another way to track how societies work out the handles on military power. Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life. 
 This is one of the silliest movies I have ever had the misfortune to watch! I should have expected it after seeing the first two but I keep getting suckered into these types of movies with the idea of Maybe they did it right this time . Nope - not even close. Where do I begin? How about with the special effects... To give you an idea of what passes for SFX in this movie at one point a soldier is shooting at a Raptor as it runs down a hallway. Even with less than a second of screen time the viewer can easily see that it is just a man with a tail apparently taped to him running around. Bad bad bad bad. How about the acting? If that's what you can call it. There is one character who I suppose is supposed to be from the south. However after living in the south for six years now I have never heard this way of talking. Perhaps he has some sort of weird disability - the inability to talk normally. I find it fascinating that the character does nothing that requires him to have that accent - therefore there was no reason for the actor to try to do one. How about the plot? It's pretty basic - Raptors escape people with guns must hunt them down. I'm starting to wonder why the dinosaurs in these movies always seem to run into the nearest system of tunnels... wouldn't they stay outside to hunt prey? Oh well at least they have the good sense to appear very very little in the movie which supposedly revolves around them. Other things - Let's say you are in a building and you know that there are man eating raptors running around in it. Would you decide to take time out to have an argument about who is better - Army or Marine? And then decide to have an arm wrestling contest to settle it? How about the idiotic idea that they have to track down the raptors - Split up into groups of two. Didn't they ever watch any horror movies (Or at least an episode of Scooby Doo)? In short this is one of the dumber movies out there. Miss it unless you want to groan your way through a movie. 
 Man has been to the farthest reaches of the earth and now he is traveling to new worlds. But with new worlds come ancient evils... the vampires of space. And not just a handful but entire tribes. In this film (which I saw as Bloodsuckers but I guess also goes as Vampires Wars ) we see what happens when the imperialist earthlings meet the imperialist vampires. I will make this review very short because it's undeserving of a good review. The best I can say for this film is it has a good cast of b-list and upcoming stars. Natassia Malthe was Quintana and was far more attractive here than in Bloodrayne 2 . Michael Ironside is Muco and is always a fan favorite (as I say he's the poor man's Jack Nicholson). And we even get Carrie-Ann Fleming as Damian's wife who horror fans will now recognize as the eponymous Jenifer from Dario Argento's Jenifer . So this movie as bad as it is isn't without some names attached... but the same can be said of Uwe Boll's work. The concept of the military tracking and killing vampires in space isn't necessarily a bad idea but it easily falls into the realm of cheese and this film falls hard. The acting especially from the vampires is over the top and I just didn't find the explanations of their existence very convincing. Worst of all the vampire tribes have the names Voorhess and Leatherfaces . I understand this was supposed to be a clever reference for the horror fans but it wasn't clever at all. It just sounded dumb and out of place (unlike the much more subtle references in James Gunn's Slither such as naming stores after lesser-known horror directors). That's all I want to say. If you can stand lots of cheese (on this day I couldn't and I'm from Wisconsin) and want to see average actors with poor costumes fight vampires in space (although space looks a lot like any other forest on earth) check this one out if you can find it. I don't personally recommend this when you can watch other cheesy vampires films (Jon Carpenter's Vampires ) or other cheesy space movies. Or maybe even some good ones. But hey do your thing. 
 Oh well this movie starts off well. It's kinda funny and seems like it could be a fun movie. Then it becomes a bit serious and goes off the rails. It sort of wants to be 'Boogie Nights' but it can't achieve it. If only it stayed with the tone of the first quarter of the film... 
 i think that new york is a big fake i mean her whole guidelines of this show is stupid. i enjoyed flavor fl av more better she acts like a slut and a hoe put together. her mother is out of this world i think she is the devils daughter. i mean what does she think she is doing these men already have girls and i believe once you have been with her you will be to ashamed to go back to your girl. she is nasty spoiled and a big fat fake.the show is very interesting to watch how much money is she getting to do this awful show and whats up with her mother i thought her and new york did not get along but now it seems as though she is just as fake as her crazy daughter.and where is the so called husband he is no where to be found i would not to be with them either. 
 Let me begin by saying I am a big fantasy fan. However this film is not for me. Many far-fetched arguments are trying to support this film's claim that dragons possibly ever existed. The film mentions connections in different stories from different countries but fails to investigate them more thoroughly which could have given the film some credibility. The film uses (nice!) CGI to tell us a narrated fantasy story on a young dragon's life. This is combined with popular-TV-show-CSI-style flash-forwards to make it look like something scientific which it is definitely not. In many cases the arguments/clues are far-fetched. In some cases clues used to show dragons possibly existed or flew or spit fire are simply invalid. To see this just makes me get cramp in my toes. Even a fantasy film needs some degree of reality in it but this one just doesn't have it. Bottom line: it's a pretentious fantasy-CSI documentary not worth watching. 
 This is quite literally the worst movie I have ever watched in my life. It may be the worst movie possible. Some movies are so bad that they're good; this movie is so bad that it goes past enjoyable camp and simply becomes unwatchably awful. It is the anti-enantiodromia. We bought it with the intent to heckle and all of my family gathered around for a fun evening of clever remarks; instead we sat in stunned silence pitying poor Peter Sellers. This is worse than the animated Lord of the Rings. It is worse than the Matrix sequels. It is worse than Krull. It is worse than any Batman movie. Do not under any circumstances let this movie approach within ten feet of your television. 
 We have a lake. We have an animated meteor crashing. We have a killer stop-motion dinosaur with flippers. Okay so let's call this movie THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER. What else can we add? Hmm two idiots called Arnie & Mitch to define the ultimate definition of comic relief . We also got to have a sheriff who doesn't really do a damn thing in this film and whom nobody listens to. Aw crap we're over halfway through the movie and we forgot to insert a bad guy! No worries let's introduce some guy with a moustache have him rob a store to indicate he's a bad guy then have him pop up somewhere near the lake have him chased through the woods and all this for the sole purpose of him ending up as dinosaur snack food. That should work. A complete clumsy mess this film. Its logic will twist your mind to force laughter out of you. The first film to feature Dave Allen as a stop motion supervisor . After this one he joined forces with Charles Band for several years until the the mid-nineties when Band ran out of money to pay him I guess. The dinosaur effects are charming and the whole film is pretty damn unintentionally funny. Unfortunately that's about the only good thing that can be said for it. Good Badness? Yes. The mind-bending logic in the narrative should be enough reason to put it on the list. If not Arnie & Mitch will do the trick. 3/10 and 8/10 
 Let me first state that I enjoy watching bad movies. It's funny how some of these films leave more of a lasting impression than the truly superb ones. This film is bad in a disturbingly malicious way. This vehicle for Sam Mraovich's delusional ego doesn't just border on talentless ineptitude it has redefined the very meaning of the words. This should forever be the barometer for bad movies. Sort of the Mendoza line for film. Mr. Mraovich writes directs and stars as blunt object Arthur Sailes battling scorned wives and the Christian forces of evil as he and his partner Ben dead behind the eyes Sheets struggle for marital equality. As a libertarian I believe gays should have a right to get married. Ben & Arthur do more harm to that cause than an army of homophobes. The portrayal of all things Christian are so ugly and ham-fisted trademark Mraovich that you can't possibly take any of them seriously. Arthur's brother Victor the bible toting Jesus freak is so horribly over-the-top evil/effeminately gay that you have to wonder how he was cast in this role. That's because Sam multitasking Mraovich was also casting director. The worst of it all is Sam Mraovich himself. When you think leading man do the words pasty balding and chubby come to mind? Sam also delivers lines like domino's pizza cold and usually wrong. The final tally: you suck at writing directing acting and casting. That's the Ed Wood quadruple crown. Congratulations you horrible little man. 
 This movie made me really mad because the main characters or all the characters have a southern accent. I've lived in Iowa for 29 years and I know that people don't have a southern accent here. This movie is about a guy who does meth and I don't know the real plot or what the movie is suppose to be about. It has some pretty graphic drug use in it and it's really insulting so see these people use meth like it was sugar. I lost my brother to meth and this movie makes me sick to my stomach because it glamorizes the drug. The movie makes it look cool to use the drug but I was happy at the end when the guy almost made it across the state line. I also know that most women who experience a traumatic rape don't want to make love to their boyfriend or husband the next day. The movie is just wrong in all directions. I would suggest The Basketball Diaries if I was going to suggest a movie about drugs. 
 It's not the most well made slasher movies of all time but for what it is it's pretty amusing. The plot is lame but the kills are not too bad. I have to be honest if you don't follow the bands that are featured in this film you wont find this film as funny as those who do. I knew someone who saw this film and was really disappointed because of the poor quality of the film but you have to understand that it was made in the spare time of being on tour in between playing to moshing kids and drinkin' with friends backstage...it's not made to be taken seriously. It's ubber cheese at it's punk best and with over 100 kills most of which are ultra gory it's a fun movie to have friends over to watch drink and be merry! 
 ..Oh wait I can! This movie is not for the typical film snob unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions like continuity editing and geographic match . I couldn't tell where I was in this movie. One second they're in the present next minute their supposedly in the 70's driving a modern SUV and wearing what looked like to me as 80's style clothing. I think. I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3d which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff and by b-movie I mean BAD movie then this film is for you. It's home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni though just skip this one. 
 This movie was recently released on DVD in the US and I finally got the chance to see this hard-to-find gem. It even came with original theatrical previews of other Italian horror classics like SPASMO and BEYOND THE DARKNESS . Unfortunately the previews were the best thing about this movie. ZOMBI 3 in a bizarre way is actually linked to the infamous Lucio Fulci ZOMBIE franchise which began in 1979. Similarly compared to ZOMBIE ZOMBI 3 consists of a threadbare plot and a handful of extremely bad actors that keeps this 'horror' trash barely afloat. The gore is nearly non-existent (unless one is frightened of people running around with green moss on their faces) and the English dubbing is a notch below embarrassing. The plot this time around involves some sort of covert military operation with a bunch of inept scientists (ie. an idiotic male and his stupid female side-kick) who are developing some sort of chemical called Death One that is supposed to re-animate the dead. Unless my ears need to be checked I don't even recall a REASON for the research of Death One . It seems to EXIST only to wreak havoc upon the poor souls who made the mistake of choosing to 'star' in this cinematic laugh-fest. Anyway Death One is experimented on a corpse (whom I swear looked like Yul Brynner) and after it is injected into his system he sits upright and his head explodes! The sound effects are also quite hilarious - as the corpse's face bubbles with green slime the sound of 'paper crumpling' can be heard. The Death One toxin is transported outside and is 'hi-jacked' by a group of thieves where one makes off with it but infects himself after cutting himself on an exposed vial. Needless to say the guy turns into a zombie but not before he makes his timely escape to a cheap motel infects a lowly porter and murders a maid by pushing her face into a bathroom mirror(!). The military catch wind of this and immediately take action before 'eliminating' everyone who is unlucky enough to be within the 'contamination zone' and turn the motel upside down. They find the infected thief and burn his body only to have the smoke infect a flock of birds that are flying over the chimney stack(!). We cut to the introduction of a group of men who are on leave from the army listening to 'groovy music' that is coming out of a little dinky boom-box while trailing a trailer-load of slutty girls who are leaning out of the windows and showing off their chests. Can someone say zombie food ? We also have a sub-plot involving a girl and her boyfriend driving a car who stop to inspect a group of birds lying on the road... the same birds that were infected by the 'zombie' smoke! The birds attack the boyfriend and the girl drives off to a deserted gas station to seek water. This is one of the most incredibly hilarious moments of the movie. She walks around this old dirty rusty and obviously abandoned building where she continues to ask aloud HELLO? IS THERE ANYONE HERE? PLEASE I JUST NEED SOME WATER! She encounters a group of zombies one of which is chained to a wall (!) and the other is swinging a machete. After a bit of rumbling and tumbling around on the ground she escapes but not before blowing up the gas station with her lighter. Meanwhile the birds attack the trailer-load of whores and one girl gets pecked and infected. They all pull up to the same motel where the original infection took place and this is where the second most hilarious moment of the film takes place. After a matter of hours (a day at the most) the same motel is now caked in dust has vines growing throughout it and looks like it has been sitting derelict for years. Anyway what better place to take refuge than this particular building? Needless to say the group begins to break down as several people walk off together to get themselves stuck in an incredibly stupid situation involving a zombie attack. The third most hilarious moment concerns a man and a woman who explore a deserted village of which the woman comments THIS PLACE IS A DUMP! She then proceeds to get 'pushed' off a balcony by a zombie into pirahna(?) infested water where she has her legs bitten off and turns into a zombie within seconds! Meanwhile her friend back at the motel who got pecked and infected HOURS earlier is still TURNING into a zombie! Unfortunately there are just too many inconsistencies in this movie that makes this movie just too stupid for words. For example the time rate concerning infected people being 'zombified' differs greatly. Sometimes it takes seconds other times it takes hours. Some zombies run others drag their feet and walk really slow. Some even do kung-fu moves while others hide under stacks of hay to surprise people. Some of the zombies even talk! The funniest moment of course is the infamous 'zombie head in the fridge' gag which 'elevates' itself in mid-air and 'attacks' a stupid man who goes looking for food. Funnily enough his girlfriend gets her throat torn out by it's 'headless' counter-part (LMAO!). The biggest disappointment for me though was the lack of story-lines involving the people who are in fact killed by zombies. We never get to see them come back as zombies in fact the only ones we do see 'zombified' are the ones pecked by the birds and the one girl who gets her legs bitten off. Other than that I was at least expecting the couple who were killed in the kitchen and/or the guy who was killed on the bridge to come back as zombies. It is also amazing that these zombies only take a 'few bites' and then move on to their next victim. The most laughable moment was of course the zombie fetus. A pregnant woman who has been infected lies on a bed in a hospital. A woman who seems to have a lot of 'medical knowledge' tries to deliver the baby (!) and has her face pulled off by a zombie before having her head pushed into the woman's stomach where a hand bursts out and proceeds to rip the rest of her face off. Timeless! As usual all the characters are perfect stereotypes of this genre. The megalomaniacal military officer the pathetic useless squealing women who scream to get killed the obvious characters who are ABOUT to get killed (ie. watch for the man chasing a chicken!) I guess this movie really is a comedy. There were many laughable scenes such as the shed that gets blown up with a hand grenade (obviously the scene where the entire budget was spent) and a climatic scene where a man screams I'M THIRSTY.... THIRSTY FOR YOUR BLOOD! . The costumes are really bad - the same zombies reappear throughout the course of the film wearing the same 'Asian-like' clothing that may be found in a Bruce Lee film and watch out for the blue 60's skirt the girl at the motel is wearing when she and her boyfriend bump into the infected man. The end of the film leaves open the door as usual for the apocalyptic story-line. A radio DJ who narrates throughout the whole movie turns out to be a zombie himself and warns his listeners about the 'beginning of the end' while the two survivors take off in a helicopter. Hardly DAWN OF THE DEAD material if you ask me. Regardless this movie does deliver many laughs. The gore is minimal and what gore there is it is very unconvincing let alone unimaginative. The usual mix of black blood thick green goo oozing out of weeping sores and 'zombie make-up' consisting of green moss. ZOMBI 3 makes for a good rental for a sleep-over party or a night of beer and popcorn. Other than that horror fans should stay away. 3 out of 10 
 i have to say that this was the worst film of priyadarshan(releasing alongside much better kyonki which was also his directorial venture) it contains no specific storyline and just focuses on body showing by debuting actresses and some silly comedy sequences. I think priyadarshan is becoming too much repetitive in his comedy flicks just like govinda and David dhavan had done in the past after giving some good entertainers they also went on to loose their audiences.So it will be good for him to concentrate more on script and try some variations in his direction.Give us more of herapheri's and malamal weekly's rather than giving duds like garam masala! 
 Another American Pie movie has been shoved down our throats and this one is the worst one of them all. It doesn't deserve the name American Pie. They should have stopped at The Wedding . This movie feels like just a stupid porn movie which they slapped the title American Pie on. When i was watching this i felt like i was watching a different series. It doesn't fell like American Pie at all. It has different humor and it is much more rude and has many more sex scenes then the other American Pie movies. I don't recommend it ever. Actually i don't recommend any of the American Pie Presents movies. Just stick with the nice original trilogy. 2/10 
 If you make it through the opening credits this may be your type of movie. From the first screen image of a woman holding her hands up to her face with white sheets blowing in the background one recalls a pretentious perfume commercial. It's all downhill from there. The lead actress is basically a block of wood who uses her computer to reach into the past and reconstruct the memories of photographs to talk history's overlooked genius Ada who conceived the first computer language in the 1800s. The low budget graphics would be forgivable if they were interesting or even somewhat integral to the script. Poor Tilda Swinton is wasted. 
 I think this movie was supposed to be shocking. But the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly it's been made ...and simply is. It's one-and-a-half hour of torment. Even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie (the five girls). Sure the main characters get their bloody piece in a bad way which is basically fine since it's a horror-movie. And I (usually) like horror-movies. I've no problem with violence in these type of movies per se. However all the violence in this film serves no end whatsoever. It's no spectacle other than that it's simply grotesque. It's so lame it even gets boring and really quick too. The worst thing (if the above wasn't bad enough for ya) about this movie is that they've tried to copy the Blair Whitch Project by filming with cheap hand-held-cameras. But (again this too) serves no end whatsoever. In the Blair Which sure enough there's an explanation namely they are their with a camera looking for the blair witch. In this film there's no other explanation than: Hey ya'll we wanted this to LOOK LIKE the Blair Whitch!! The sound in the movie is also something to get depressed about. The girls are screaming so hysterically that many a time you can't make out what they're saying. Also no effort has been made to make anything any better sound-wise or other wise. Than finally there's the soundtrack which is just as bad as the rest and varies from cheap euro-house to the worst grungy hard-rock... My advise: Don't watch this under ANY circumstances. 
 It's a waist to indulge such great actors in such a weak and boring movie. Besides all the unanswered questions posted in the other comments what's so difficult about capturing the robbers? Just eliminate the bank workers see who was at the bank-from all the cameras' footage angles-prior to the robbers entry and you have those extra 4 remaining robbers among the hostages. Where is the suspense every body is talking about? It was so obvious the moment the hostages were asked to change into this identical uniform that they were all going to walk out the front door... seen it many times. At least Mr. Spike Lee could have seasoned the movie with some good music score and artistic shooting. The Movie is not worth it. Pronto! 
 I love Jane Austen's stories. I've only read two of them (P&P and S&S) but after having seen this adaption I'm reaching for Persuasion from my bookcase just to make sense out of the story and also because I refusing to believe Jane Austen could have written such nonsense. For me I thought that if you base a film on a Jane Austen novel you can't really go wrong. It will turn out great pretty much by default. I was wrong. First of all where are the characters that you sympathise with and like? You have to have at least one likable character to get the audience to invest their emotions in them and this did not deliver. Sure I wanted Anne and Wentworth to get together but only because that's what you know the purpose of the story is them getting together. Instead I had to resist urges to throw my teacup at the TV and to continue watching it to the end. Anne was utterly annoying throughout and in the end I really have no idea why Wentworth was so smitten by her as there seemed to be nothing there for him to be attracted to. She was meek bland dull socially inadequate and came across like a sheep following everyone else's instructions rather than having a mind of her own. This can still work for a lead character if you do it well. This wasn't done well. The other characters were just displaying various degrees of narcissism of which Mary was the worst with a full-blown narcissistic personality disorder. Where Mrs. Bennet in P&P had similar flaws she was still endearing whereas Mary was more of a freak-show. More loathsome than funny. Wentworth was very handsome and seemed like a decent kind of guy. For the most part of the story I was just wondering what kind of person he was and why he's in love with Anne as surely he's the kind of guy who would want a person who is a little bit more... alive? Acting-wise not too much to say as I reacted more to the characters being portrayed rather than how good/bad the people acting were. Anthony Head was excellent but as soon as I saw he was in it I expected no less. Also found the story very confusing. It wasn't until the end of the movie where it seemed as if Elizabeth was not Anne's stepmother but in fact a sister (I'm still not 100% on that). The whole Anne/Wentworth back story was also a bit fuzzy. They had been together but then broke up and they're both bitter about it? How come? I was wondering this for quite some time and the explanation seemed to be she dumped him because she was persuaded to do so by someone? But it was said in a kind of by the by way that it was almost missed as if it was somehow unimportant. How can it be unimportant when it's the very core of the story?? There was also a lot of name-dropping but no real feel for who the characters were. This Louisa person for instance who was she? A friend? Family? What? It wasn't made very clear who the different characters are and their relationship with one another. Lady Russell was there a lot but why? Mrs. Croft and Wentworth were brother and sister which felt very unrealistic as Mrs. Croft looked old enough to be his mother. The final kiss yes it was a bit strange them kissing in the street but I didn't really think about it because I was too busy yelling GET ON WITH IT ALREADY!! at the TV because Anne's lips trembled and trembled and trembled for what felt like ages before they actually met Wentworth's. Have SOME hesitation there but only for a couple of seconds or so not half a minute. Then there's the issue of camera work. As a regular movie watcher you don't pay attention to angles and such unless you decide to look out for it. I didn't decide to do so here but I still noticed them. To me that means the filmmakers are not doing a good job. A lot of conversations were with extreme facial closeups something that should only be used when there's a really important point to be made. In this adaption it was over-used and therefore lacked meaning. The hand-held feeling on occasion also didn't really work in a period drama. The camera work in the running scene in the end also felt too contemporary. (Not to mention the running itself.) This was the only Austen adaption I caught in ITV's Austen season. Makes me wonder if it's worth watching Northanger Abbey and Mansfield Park or if I should just read the books and leave it at that. I'm sad to say this is a Jane Austen adaption I did not enjoy. Maybe I'll watch the 1995 version instead. The BBC are renowned for having done beautiful Austen adaptations before after all. 
 Summer season is here when the choices in the cinemas are limited to what's the hottest movie of the week given 99.9% of the screens dedicated to screening it. OK so I may exaggerate on the percentage but you get my drift. Besides stuff from Hollywood Bollywood too have their own share of highly anticipated blockbusters and from some of the trailers shown I'm hyped to watch them too. Tashan was billed as one of THE most highly anticipated for 2008 but I was quite surprised at the lower than low turnout at the cinemas. When I watched Jodha Akbar it was a full house but it wasn't for Tashan. After watching it I knew why. It was entertaining but it was fundamentally weak. Just like it's literal English title which means Style Tashan is all style but little substance. Not that it doesn't have the usual star power but scenes felt forced and some bordered on a tad ridiculous even for Bollywood standards I must say. Which is quite surprising given that Tashan is directed and written by Vijay Krishna Acharya who wrote Dhoom and Dhoom 2 both of which I enjoyed tremendously. In his rookie directorial outing with Tashan while you can't fault his direction you'd probably scratch your head over the plot which was clunky at best. It tried to force too many things into the story though credit be given where it allowed you some avenue to question character motivation but that came a little too late and only toward the finale which left you guessing for just a moment before it latched into full blown action mimicking many a Thai action movie with Hong Kong's wirework and Hollywood's ludicrous firearms and gunplay with zero recoil. And in a bid to include everything including the kitchen sink you have an assortment of vehicles appearing and the one that took the cake in a Dhoom 2 homage was the jetski boat in the middle of nowhere. At best Tashan can be enjoyed as unintentional comedy and this is attributed to how the cast hammed up with their characters. Saif Ali Khan plays Jimmy Cliff a call center executive who gives English tuition only as a platform for fishing out new girlfriend material. His playboy ways gets junked aside when he meets with Pooja Singh (Kareena Kapoor) who's not exactly who she seems the meek and sweet natured hottie. She engages Jimmy's services for her boss mobster Bhaiyyaji (Anil Kapoor) who probably gets most of the laughs as he speaks broken English and phrases must like how an ah-beng does it. And to complete the quartet Akshay Kumar plays Bachchan Pandey an illiterate gangster for hire who got engaged by Bhaiyyaji to hunt down Jimmy and Pooja when they escape with money stolen from Bahiyyaji's business. So begins a road trip of sorts with friends who turned enemies and enemies whom you know will become friends as the road trip wears on. Jimmy Cliff is probably the most implausible of all because he goes from zero to hero executing moves that would shame Rambo in absolutely no time which is quite out of character. Kareena Kapoor amps up the sex factor as she uses her charms to guile both men and has plenty of opportunity to do so given the much touted bikini scenes and other costumes that boast of plunging necklines or hemlines way above the knee. Every character has a backstory created and I thought Akshay Kumar's Bachchan Pandey was probably the best the most touching and the most fun of the lot even though his character seemed a lot like a non-green Incredible Hulk with his gravity-defying leaps and power packing punches. His wounds also heal automatically which impressively puts Wolverine to shame. And the best part is his theme song which is damn alpha-male and played in ra-ra mode each time he takes on adversaries. But sad to say that's the only tune that is memorable something that cheers Bachchan- Pandey-Bachchan-Pandey . For most Bollywood movies I watch I will usually be able to despite the obvious language gaps emerge from screenings humming a tune or two. I wasn't able to do that after Tashan because the songs unfortunately just weren't catchy at all. Usually the song/dance routine works well into the storyline without any necessity to bring the characters out of the current scene or location. That I enjoy versus plucking them out and plonking them into extreme settings high atop a mountain or atop jagged rocks on the beach front. Tashan probably didn't take itself too seriously but coming from Vijay Krishna Acharya's story you probably wanted something a little more decent rather than the ridiculous and for continuity to be a little more careful as well. Billed as a blockbuster now I can start to understand why the crowds have already shunned this one. Despite Akshay Kumr stealing the show Tashan could have been better on the whole. 
 SNL is pretty funny but people who say this is like watching a Short skit on SNL is a little dumb minded. It's NOTHING like SNL it's just a stupid piece of crap. Andy Samberg tries to act like Jon Heder but fails. Although Jon Heder is only funny in Napoleon Dynamite Andy tries his hardest and people think he's funny. Only funny people in the movie were Danny McBride and Bill Hader. The only part that was decently funny with Andy was the pool part. They could have made the Quiet place a lot better if they didn't make the falling scene 3 freaking minutes. The part where he's pronouncing his H's more is retarded. They try going with it too long and half the time it looks like Andy is laughing while he acts...he's a horrible actor and doesn't deserve to be in a movie. This movie is a joke and is for the simple minded people with the brain of a 10 year old level of comedy. Which is about half the United States. 
 Dark Rising is your typical bad obviously quickly produced horror/sci-fi/fantasy movie. It has a strange unexplained plot with holes so big you could fit an elephant through them. Most of the time I didn't know what the hell was going on but it didn't really matter it was a simple demon hunter returns from hell dimension to save campers story with confusing stuff added on about witches and a book of evil with plot elements and characters who make no sense or disappear totally for no reason. The acting is bad but there honestly is not much they can do with this script I am guessing. There is a couple topless scenes which is probably the only reason this bad movie got made (like so many other bad movies). Give this one a pass unless there is nothing else on T.V. 
 William Russ is the main character throughout this made for TV movie. He left his family behind to only reappear and begin paying off his debts. But he tries to keep away from his family. Thats where Peter Falk (Colombo) comes in playing several different roles to convince him to come home. The story is average and they actually managed to get a former star (Peter Falk) and use him to a fairly nice degree. But William Russ wasn't truly a star. However it appears his acting is still OK. I found the delivery and story very cheesy in how everything was predictable. In fact the last 20 minutes I could almost dictate word for word before it happened. A good movie should never be like that. Overall it was a sub-par movie. In a letter grading system it would receive a D . 
 I was able to hang in for only the first twenty minutes of this low-budget movie. The most glaring absurdity was that while the American inmates in a North Korean POW camp are all supposedly suffering from severe deprivation of food and medicine going without bathing shivering in flimsy and filthy parkas and sleeping on bare floors and - let's not forget enduring torture - they always manage to sport impeccably coiffed hair. With the exception of a suitably austere-looking Harry Morgan as an army Major the casting and acting are simply awful. Ronald Regan cannot seem to stick to portraying a single character and instead creates a rather schizophrenic amalgam of past roles. A mostly Caucasian cast portraying the North Korean camp officers might have been forgivable but when supposedly Russian officers acting as advisors to the Koreans strut around wearing re-badged Nazi uniforms complete with jodhpurs and jackboots (obvious costume-department recycles from WWII flicks) and speaking with accents like General Burkhalter from Hogan's Heroes well that's just six kinds of silly. Don't waste your time on this one. 
 A friend of mine gave me this movie. A friend of mine is now in a hospital were a team of doctors are trying to surgically remove a DVD casing from his ***. I got quit excited by the prospects of an other Michael Chabon movie. After all his novels have brought me much entertainment and previous screenplay adaptations were great but boy was I wrong. First off the people that did the casting must have been asleep whilst doing so. I imagine the castings went something like this. Tell me do you like fish? Yes I enjoy fish very much. Wonder full you're hired. Have some money. Than there is the script. I have read Chabon who I hope went blind before he could see this piece of dong and it has absolutely nothing to do with his novel. I'm not quit sure why it annoyed me like it did but it might have something to do with the fact that listening to a speech impaired 90 year old drunk duck hunter with a right cranial lobe dysfunction would have been a treat in comparison to the one-liners these 2nd degree model massacre kids spat out. This is an actual line from the movie; If you tell me something that you've never said out loud to anyone before than this moment becomes unique! Unique? Does it? Does it really? Off course not you plank. Please pass me the Imodium. I'll have a whole ****ing strip. The directing is... well. I've got nothing. Maybe Rawson Marshall Thurber just got word his grandmother exploded or something. Stick to directing comedies. No stick to directing commercials. This movie is so horrible it left me banging my head against a wall so hard it brought me back to the stone age. I give it 2 stars because I don't wanna be the guy that watched a 1 star movie. 
 The film attempts to be a mockumentary--shot in the documentary form but with many obviously scripted parts--but fails in not providing the audience with any characters with which to create the illusion of the mockumentary. Also the film purports to be about finding real love in Los Angeles but is nothing more than an uninteresting look at an amateur filmmaker trying to make his first big movie.  
 After watching this on the MST3K episode I have to wonder how many movies this film borrows from. It seems to combine elements of Logans Run Farenheight 451 Final Sacrifice and at least several others. At one point I was really expecting Cris Makepease to call Lee Majors ROWSDOWER. I wonder if the director has any clue how many holes there are in the plot. like the fact that even though gas is unavailable there is plenty of it in abandoned gas stations and the stations are located close enough together to keep an F1 race car going all the way across the country. 
 This movie is so awful it is hard to find the right words to describe it! At first the story is so ridiculous.A narrow-minded human can write a better plot! The actors are boring and untalented perhaps they were compelled to play in this cheesy Film. The camera receptions of the National Forest are the only good in this whole movie. I should feel ashame because I paid for this lousy Picture. Hopefully nobody makes a sequel or make a similar film with such a worse storyline :-) 
 ... mainly because Ju-on 2 boasts an outrageous FORTY minutes' worth of material literally taken straight out of the first Ju-on - and when you consider that the sequel only runs for 76 minutes that leaves you with 36 original minutes' worth of film. Ho-hum. I found that deeply irritating - as if viewers simply wouldn't remember the same stuff! - not to mention dull having to watch it all over again. OK that complaint aside the byline for Ju-on 2 was that it was supposed to explain a lot of the unanswered questions from the first movie which frankly over 36 minutes simply doesn't go far enough to making any kind of sense of the original's highly convoluted storyline. There are however some really nice new horror sequences which show how good the film might have been had it had some time to develop; and some of the questions raised by the original - some but not all - are answered. So in conclusion - if you loved the first original movie and want to see some further developments on the story go for it - but just remember to keep your remote control to hand with your finger on the fast-forward button for forty minutes. 
 The movie starts out fine. Widower out with new girlfriend and the children. The movie is filled with stupid director's choices. Like lets separate. I am coming down to.... do what? Stupid Stupid Stupid. Please do not waste your time hoping that it will get better.............. Not hardly. 
 Land of Plenty is not a film. It is a tombstone for the directorial career of German Director Wim Wenders. Many felt it in The Million Dollar Hotel and now Land of Plenty makes it perfectly clear; not only has Wenders lost it he's actually turned into a BAD director creating horribly weak and superficial stories and scenes. One might argue that the time you lose it comes for every director but Wenders' case is extreme. It's as if he completely forget everything he knew about cinema and started all over again - only to get sloppish results. In a few words this film does not deserve your time. 
 Warning: This review contains a spoiler. Wow. Almost impressively bad. Note I said almost . This is nothing more than lots of random scenes strung together in a loose attempt at a story. The protagonists (you CANNOT call them heroes ) shoot innocent bystanders for their food and also rob same for similar reasons. There's also tons of homoeroticism which was a turnoff for me. (SPOILER: It seems as if the villainess (who only is topless and not naked as other reviews claim) gets killed early on but miraculously recovers adding another 70 minutes of audience-torture.) I can't shake the feeling that animal abuse occurred numerous times in this cinematic abomination. If you're in a MST3K mood you might find this watchable but for the most part you can forget it. Go rent the original Conan DVD instead. 
 On the way back from IMC6 (San Jose California) all five (mind you three of us hardcore Kamal fans) of us had reached a unanimous verdict; VV was solid crap and thanks to the movie we were going to have a pretty screwed up Monday. Not to mention we swore to stay off the theatres for the next year. I won't blame Kamal here because he sort of dropped a hint in a recent interview with cartoonist Madan (on Vijay TV). He said something like Tamizh Cinema'la Photography Editing'la namba munnera'na maadri Screenplay Direction Acting'la innum namba munnera'la (Tamil Cinema has grown in terms of Photography and Editing but we have hardly improved when it comes to Screenplay Direction and Acting ). While you're watching VV those words ring very true. Now here are the 10 Reasons to hate this movie: 1. Harris Jeyaraj 2. Harris Jeyaraj 3. Harris Jeyaraj I'm barely holding myself from using expletives here but fact is HJ has mastered the fine knack of screwing up every recent movie of his (remember 'Anniyan' 'Ghajini') with the jarring cacophony he bills as background music. The next time I have an eardrum transplant he's paying for it. 4. Songs Neither do the songs help move the movie's narration spatially/temporally nor do they make you sit up and take notice. The film feels like it's made of four VERY long songs with a few scenes thrown in between them. 5. A Short gone too far. VV at best is fit to be a short story not a 2 hour plus thriller . To use a clich here like the Energizer bunny it goes on and on and on; only in this case you don't want it to. The later part of a movie feels like a big drag. 6. Kamal-Jothika pairing Two ice cubes rubbed together could've produced more sparks than this lead pairing. There's no reason you would root for them to make it together. In fact every time they get together in the second half of the movie they make a good irritant to the narration. Hate to say this but Kamalini Mukerjhee's 10 minute romancing does more than what Kamal and Jothika achieve in this movie plus 'Thenali'. 7. Kamal Haasan's accent Kamal has this pretentious accent that nobody speaks either in India or in the US; and it isn't new either. He's been doing it since 'Thoongadae Thambi Thoongadae'. It's simply gets on the nerve. Imagine what havoc it can cause when his flair for using this strange accent meets shooting on location in the US. He doesn't leave it at the Immigration either he offers doses of advice to his men (bewildered TN Cops from Keeranor Sathoor and beyond) in chaste Kamanglish ( Wha we hav here is plain bad police wok ) of course with nauseating effect. 8. Logic There are a few directors whom you expect to stand up to a certain scale. Gautam fails us badly with some crappy performance in the Department of common sense. Which D.C.P in his senses would meet his love interest on the streets to discuss such matters as committing himself and life after! The scene inside the theatre was so bad towards the climax; we could hear people behind us loudly challenge the Hero's IQ. Is he stupid can't he just use his Siren or Lights? (On a busy Madras road Kamal-the-cop-on-a-police-Jeep chases a guy on a bike just like any ordinary dude!). Can't he just use his gun? ( The guy on a bike starts on foot and we have a fully geared Kamal in hot pursuit for a considerable amount of time). I'm not voting in favour of the later but I'm just trying to explain the mood inside. 9. Gore & Violence If I wanted to watch women being raped their throats getting slashed more women getting raped and thrown into the bushes with excruciating authenticity I would sit at home and rather watch a Police Report or Kuttram . The use of excessive violence should go in a way to extend the story not overwhelm it! Somewhere down the line Gautum seems confused about what the extensions (rapes murders) are and what the mainstay (story) is! 10. Even a double shot Espresso couldn't get the pain out of the head. 
 It's a poor film but I must give it to the lead actress in this one....Francine Forbes. She appeared to be acting the least and I personally thought she was kind of cute. Too bad she only appears in one other film in the database. Besides that the film is filled with laughable gore and fakey death scenes. People get stabbed and they GUSH like 2 gallons of blood! But if you like to watch poor horror films I recommend this one highly. 
 I am still shuddering at the thought of EVER seeing this movie again. I have seen action films I have even liked quite a few of them but this one goes over the top. Not only does it have the worst male actor ever (Sly Stallone) playing the lead role but the plot of the movie is so stupid from the beginning (why not rob the money while the plane is on the ground would be hell of a lot easier) that it requires a person with IQ less than his shoenumber to believe it. Furthermore the plot has no real twists at all a three year old kid could guess what comes next. It is a set of cliches (of action genre) with Sly performing even worse than his other movies (he was better even in Rambo III if you watch that movie as a comedy rather than action film). Now there is an actor who can't act A) surprised B) sad C) anything else than his basic face. I would still like to point out that this movie has two factors that might make some people like it. EXPLOSIONS are outstanding but then... you can see better on the 4th of July. LANDSCAPES are magnificient but then... there are documentaries about the Alps and Himalayas so you can see better sights that way rather than waste time on this flick. Go watch some other movie instead there are hundreds even thousands better action movies. 
 Hey everyone... There really isn't much to say for this movie at all. The basic plot is that a guy (Brandon) takes a few friends on a trip to his cabin in the woods for a weekend holiday away from work. After picking up a girl on the way there things start going badly wrong for all of them. The storyline alone (written by the actor playing Brandon I believe although I could be wrong here) is unlikely and unconvincing and is acted out accordingly. The Clown Killer himself is a rather a sad excuse for a psychotic killer. Far from being a dark mysterious but most of all intelligent predator we are instead offered a rather clumsy nursery rhyme-singing buffoon who appears to be going through a minor mid life crisis. The only thing that warranted the writing of this comment were the sex scenes and whatever gore there was in the film (the quality of the film led me to derive some enjoyment out of such things). In short this film falls below every possible set standard. Admittedly I was sharing a few beers with a close friend as I watched this so we managed to scrape together some relative entertainment value out of this film and it is therefore only fair to mention that S.I.C.K did fall just shy of a two rating. However in reality (and with the benefit of hindsight) the one star rating is a more than legitimate score for this film. 1 star out of ten. 
 Dude really!!!! where have you guys been the past 20 years this is shocking in all kind of ways horror ? This is a joke there is nothing wrong with being low budget but this is a laugh If you want to look at the classics Freaks of Tod Browning the victims of Dracula and Frankenstein the Undying Monster Ernest Thesiger Paul Wegener's The Golem and the passengers of The Ghost Train you can't compare it it gives it a bad name bad acting bad screenplay etc. Total waist of money and free time have watched a lot of movies were as horror is my all time favorite I really am speechless have nothing more to say that please don't do the effort to watch something so daft please understand 
 this film is terrible. The characters are completely unbelievable and wildly inconsistent. The plot is awful and some of the classroom scenes are cringe-worthy and make for uncomfortable viewing. In fact the quality of the script and characterisation would suggest that this film was written by high school students only the utter lack of credibility to the school environment would suggest that in fact the writers probably never went to high school. The acting in most cases was weak too although a lot of this was down to a poor script and plot i am not sure that any actors could have made this film watchable. having said that the sound track was OK and the cinematography was nice in places (although the editing was poor). 
 I still can't believe that Wes Craven was responsible for this piece of crap.This movie is worse than Deadly Friend .The plot is stupid the acting is mediocre and the film is deadly dull.I don't know why Wes Craven hates his debut Last House on the Left -an absolute masterpiece of the genre and likes(probably)this turkey.Don't get me wrong I really like some of his movies but it was a real torture sitting and watching this. 
 In short this movie is completely worthless. The idea is to make movie from the point of view of what someone from the early 1900s might think of the future. An interesting idea but the lack of compelling story or characters prevents us from ever suspending our disbelief so the idea just flops. Apparently the whole movie was done with actors in front of green screens and we are supposed to be impressed. But as a graphics person the over softening was an obvious crutch for hiding the difficult sharp edge problem with green screening. The color is majorly washed out to no relevant effect except reduce the visual quality. And I don't understand why anyone would consider anything rendered in this movie to be in any way ground breaking. If anything the ridiculous retrograde graphics have lowered the bar for really bad graphics -- they don't measure up even to the ancient Jurassic Park graphics. The models for the robots were so simple plain and very uncompelling. There were a bunch of weirdo prehistoric-like animals on that island but they are not explained in any way. The story is horrible beyond belief. In fact I can't believe I didn't just walk out of this movie. The relationship between Polly and Joe is unmotivated and throughout the movie is based on distrust and deception. Why is the Morris Paley character even there? We are not in any way convinced that Joe is heroic -- I mean he flies a plane and saved one person (Polly) for personal reasons. Yeah there's a great hero for you. Dex has very little screen time so why are we supposed to care about Joe wanting to save him? Who were the Nepalease that locked Joe and Polly in the mine vault and why would they do it (remembering that the entire Totenkopf operation was robotic)? Plot holes: (1) Why did Bai Ling's character (a major fall from her excellent character in The Crow ) halt the robots who had captured Joe? They were looking for the vials and had not found them. (2) Why in the hell would Dex be captured but not killed (he doesn't have or know about the vials and the bad guys didn't know that Polly had the vials and was connected to Joe and therefore to Dex)? (3) Polly indicates that they don't know anything about Totenkopf yet she has some secret source about him that contains what appears to be a fairly complete FBI-style file on him. (4) The blank spot on the map as described by the Nepalese -- if they know all about this mysterious area then why the hell is their map blank in that spot? (5) At one point Polly and Joe have to give up their clothes (they are burned) -- Joe is given new clothes that were identical to his old clothes yet Polly is forced to wear some very odd looking bulky dress then in the same line of continuity suddenly Polly has her original clothes back. *sigh*. How far off am I supposed to switch my brain to watch this crap? We are supposed to be exhilarated by the over produced music even when nothing interesting or remotely exhilarating is happening on screen. And the acting? We're supposed to be impressed with a bunch of bad British accents? Which character isn't annoying? I think Ling Bai's dialogue was probably the best in the whole movie (she doesn't have a single line). The dialogue wasn't camp and doesn't even rise to the level of cheese. Its just bad and annoying. These people aren't hero's or compelling; they are the kind of people you would try to ignore or disassociate with if you ever had the misfortune of meeting them in real life. I can't believe that this movie gets an above average rating here on IMDb. IMHO it should be competing with Batman Forever in the bottom 100 of all time. 
 As usual I was really looking forward to a new TV/film on a favourite subject of mine - makes a nice change from a *strangely familiar* documentary about Kursk or Stalingrad on the History Channel. I avidly looked forward to Pearl Harbour and Enemy at the Gates - but was rudely brought down to earth with the realisation of the malevolent stupid-ifying power of Hollywood - and its ability to spend an absolute fortune on tripe. So yet again I got excited about 'The Rise of Evil' especially as I heard that Ian Kershaw was involved as I've enjoyed his books. I can see why he quit. To quote some guy responsible for this rubbish: The Kershaw book was an academic piece he said. It was quite dry. We needed more incidents. Incidents? Are they totally nuts? Hitler's life cannot be said to be without 'incident' - yes Kershaw's two volume Hitler biographies were long and detailed but they were supposed to be. The thesis behind 'Rise of Evil' seems to be: Hitler was a very bad man - no he was a VERY bad man who HATED jews and just in case you miss this we're going to emphasise the fact in EVERY scene in the film. There was no effort whatsoever to try and explain the mood of the time and why Hitler may have adopted the views and strategy he did. Needless to say - unlike the generally excellent 'Nazis - A Warning from History' - this film neglected to point out the fact that nearly all of the leaders of the Munich communist rising were Jewish and that this may have coloured his views on the subject - and his axiomatic linking of the jews with Bolshevism - an absolutely crucial aspect to understanding much of the Nazi era. But there was not much understanding to be done - the film-makers weren't going to go there so we just got all the stuff we knew about anyway. We certainly don't get the fascinating fact that Kershaw alludes to which has Hitler briefly being a socialist/communist immediately after WW1. That would of course be far too complex for the film to handle and might even detract from the relentless 'he was very bad' mantra which bangs away incessantly. We know he was a bad man. However we also know that he was a mesmerising figure both as a public speaker and in more private situations. He could be polite and even sympathetic and of course espoused some views like vegetarianism anti-alcohol and anti-smoking that many Guardian readers could agree with. He was also famously fond of animals hence why that wholly invented dog-flogging scene was so absurd. He was also from all the accounts I've seen a brave soldier in WW1. Whilst we saw him with his Iron Cross we never get to see how he won it (acts of bravery were not in the script needless to say). We also get no insight whatsoever into why he was so fired up by his war experiences whilst Sassoon Owen Brook Remarque and so many others found it so repellent an experience. And again like the point above re the jewish/bolshevik link this is vital to anyone's understanding about the subject. Why did he love war so much? Why did he think it was always a good idea despite massive evidence to the contrary? Why didn't he care about his colleagues who died? Or maybe he did - but still drew the wrong conclusions. This film certainly didn't have anything of any interest to say on this either. As all too often these days the film is a classic example of 'making history relevant to the present' and inventing stuff or leaving awkward facts out to fit in with 'the present' - which all too often is to cater to the lowest common denominator where you don't trust your audience an inch so you just ram stuff down their throats knowing (sadly correctly) that you'll always get away with it because there are so many dumb fools in the world. History is really about making us relevant to the past and seeing how it colours our present for better and for worse. This rubbish was a great opportunity lost again. They spent millions on it and the locations and large scenes were impressive but told us nothing at all we didn't know already and promoted no understanding of this dark period in human history. WT 
 One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Acting was terrible both for the kids and the adults. Most to all characters showed no little or not enough emotion. The lighting was terrible and there were too many mess ups about the time of the day the film was shot (In the river scene where they just get their boat destroyed there's 4 shots; The sheriff and Dad in the evening on their boat Jillian and Molly in the evening swimming the rest of the kids in the daytime *when it's supposed to in the evening* at the river bank and the doctor Beatrice and Simonton at night but not in the evening getting off their boat.) The best acting in the movie was probably from the sheriff Cappy (Although there's a slip of character when the pulse detector *Whatever that thing is when people die it beeps* shows Cappy has died he still moves while it can still be heard beeping and while the nurse extra checks his pulse manually then it shows the pulse again and THEN he finally dies.) I guess it's not going to be perfect since it's an independent movie but it still could be better. Not worth watching honestly even for kids. Might as well watch something good like The Lion King or Toy Story if you're going to see anything you'll remember. 
 This miserable film is a remake of a 1927 film. They should have let it remain that way. What a colossal bomb! Douglas Fairbanks displays absolutely no charisma here. Cesar Romero is subjected to a role as a real jerk and Bette Grable sings with a chorus- What I'll Do to that Hungarian! The ridiculous plot deals with a picture of a woman in a castle in 1561 Rome that saved the day by killing a conqueror. (Fairbanks) Now let's fast forward to 300 years later where Grable just married to the Count Romero faces a similar situation when on her wedding night there is an invasion by Hungarian soldiers. Romero acts cowardly and flees before the army arrives. He disguises himself as a gypsy and is made to remain at the castle when his violin playing pleases Fairbanks. The ending is worse than the entire wretched film when Grable meets Fairbanks to tell him the good news-an enraged Romero has annulled the marriage. This poor imitation of a movie was made in 1948. As Harry Davenport a veteran supporting player who is in it died in 1949; this must have been his last film. What a bomb to go out with after such a distinguished career. Walter Abel co-stars but he can do little with such poor writing. The costumes look more like those that would come out of the stone age. I can't fathom what Fairbanks was wearing. 
 Celia Johnson is good as the Nurse. Michael Hordern is good as Capulet though it's his usual neighing and whinnying and not a patch on his King Lear. John O'Conor reads the verse well as Friar Laurence though he never takes it anywhere. Alan Rickman is good as Tybalt in the first of his yuk roles that would make him famous. Christopher Strauli's Benvolio is sympathetic. The sets are pretty if not stunning as in some of the other BBC Shakespeare's. And that's it. The rest is weak to dreadful. Rebecca Saire turned 15 during production and hasn't a clue about how to act Juliet - she opens her eyes real wide and whines every line in exactly the same way. Patrick Ryecart is poorly matched to her and his self-regard is inexplicable. The Balcony Scene flows smoothly and uneventfully with zero emotional or erotic impact. Their deaths come as a relief. If I had a dagger I would have offered it to them hours earlier. Anthony Andrews is unspeakable as Mercutio a great shock if you remember his fine work in Brideshead Revisited. He breaks the mirror of Shakespeare's verse into a thousand shards of two or three words each and then shouts the fragments in as disconnected and unintelligible manner as possible. In this production Queen Mab abdicates. Awful. The director Alvin Rakoff shows only an intermittent gift of putting the camera where it will show us what we want to see. The opening brawl is notably incoherent. However there is humor when in a later fight Romeo apparently knees Tybalt right in the cobblers. Tybalt then grabs the offended region. However did that get through? R&J is a long play. This version is not recommended for classroom use or much else. 
 So Steve Irwin. You have to admire a man who is not only willing to throw himself into a river that clearly is filled with crocs snakes lizards tons of poop from the aforementioned reptiles and mud not only daily but with enthusiasm. He was never able to make ME want to do it but he managed to make his wife come close. This movie does not fall into my parallel universe of film category - the films for people who just had their teeth drilled have a migraine or have no film experience and therefore like quiet mediocrity (currently well populated by Disney films). It's too noisy. Well Steve is too noisy. He's just so happy all the time and would cut right through the blas' teenager (I can hear it now: that movie was so STUPID ) or the Tylenol with codeine. I'd say his enthusiasm is catching but if it was I would own a room full of snakes and that hasn't happened yet. I agreed they're beauties but I'm still not going to pet them. Plot was indeed predictable. Bad guys were so bad for a minute there I thought I was shopping at a consumer electronic superstore. But the movie was filled with animals and Steve and Terri which is why I watched it. That plot (if you could call it that) was really more of a reason to throw yet another croc in a truck. My expectations were low and stayed that way. I was hoping though that there would be a bit of a sequel where Steve and Terri (having worked on their acting skills) have a movie with a real plot and more animals with fur. I still can't believe we won't see Steve anymore. I hope that Terri and the children continue to be involved in the Australia Zoo and the discovery channel at least. I can't imagine seeing a crocodile without having some member of the Irwin family telling me forcefully how wonderful that croc is. Crikey! 
 I saw this movie once and I thought it was OK. Then my friends at work said Watch it again it's better . So I did. And to my surprise it was WORSE on the second time! There's a word limit so I'm going to get the ball rolling here. -The bombing scenes were all so stupid. Why on earth would anyone WAIT to trigger the explosion??? -None of the characters here are even remotely likable. Not on the first time not even the second. -Oh and last time I checked a car does not explode from a single gun shot nor can a fire THAT huge be put out with a tiny fire extinguisher... did the above 3/10 viewers actually watch the movie??? -The camera is so shaky I can barely tell what is going on. That opening scene with the robot had my stomach off-put the rest of the movie was not much better. -The sniper scene. The McManus Brothers (from The Boondock Saints ) would roll their eyes it was so stupid. First off why did the guy plant his gun where one person had gotten shot? Furthermore why would he spend THAT much time cleaning the bullets reloading aiming and NOT get shot when there was so much chaos going on around him? -SAS types RUNNING instead of staying and fighting back?????? Huh????? Are the soldiers... gay...??? I didn't mean to sound homophobic but honestly that scene was so ridiculous. -Too long for its own good yet too short for the amount of material crammed into it. Bigelow seems to think that the more action the better. Looks like she is wrong- the movie is full of superfluous action scenes thrown in there to distract you from the lack of a central plot. I know Watchmen is longer at 163 minutes but at least that movie didn't drag. This movie on the other hand does and for it feels longer. The only good thing was Renner who was satisfactory at best. But do yourself a favour just skip this and don't give into the hype. 
 Some films are so bad that they're good. This is clearly not one of them. Based on a true story this film was about as true to the story as Pinocchio's chances of becoming a real boy. The acting was terrible the direction was poor and it travelled way too fast. It was as if the director just wanted to get it over and done with and go home. Nor did Melissa Joan Hart ever strike me as a talented actress but then every film she made was pretty low-budget anyway. Like most of her other films she lets down her characters by hamming them up too much talking too quickly as if speeding up her words is going to make her more dramatic. She really brings out the sense that there is a crew in front of her and she's talking to a camera when she should be engaging the viewer in her character. It pretty much lets down the whole film and any leg that it may have had left to stand on is ruined. Probably the only good thing about the film is when she got nailed in the end. But even that wasn't satisfying enough to subdue my loathing for such a bad film. Watch it if your taste in film is blander than a piece of dry toast. 
 To be fair they did as well as they could with a budget of five shillings and sixpence but the dialogue was more cheesy than 9lbs of emmental and the CGI was a little old hat now. maybe if some of the actors were not so perfectly chiselled out of granite it would have made the film a little better too.. To say this was awful is to do this film a mis-service if you want to see something that is totally execrable you gotta sit and waste a couple of hours of your life watching 'sickle' that is soo mind numbingly awful its actually good (several large alcoholic beverages are deriguer though. Any road up I enjoyed this film and its gotta be worth a look if you have not seen it yet just don't expect anything along the lines of 'jurassic park the lost world' or 'apocalypto'. 
 This movie is horrible if you pay attention to it. It's a perfect movie if you just watch the colorful images dance across the screen - each one with no apparent connection to the next. I rented this movie because I'm a David Bowie fan and I really appreciate musicals. In finality Bowie was in the film for a total of ten minutes and the songs and dance sequences were sparse and left something to be desired. The moral of the story was really befuddling. I couldn't tell if it was about racial issues in London in the 1950s or about not selling out. For the first half of the movie I was chuckling at how cheesy it was but I liked the campiness of the no selling out message. When blacks started being murdered I thought my tape had gotten messed up. Maybe I rented half of two different movies? Nope there was a Keep Britain White song and dance sequence. I'm sorry but WWII is not something you can write a musical about. At least not a musical that could conceivably be described as campy as I have several times in this review. Overall I'd say this movie could do a whole lot better if it made up its mind and cast better actors. (And put David Bowie in it for longer goddammit!) My grade: C- 
 I'm a Christian who generally believes in the theology taught in Left Behind. That being said I think Left Behind is one of the worst films I've seen in some time. To have a good movie you need to have a well-written screenplay. Left Behind fell woefully short on this. For one thing it radically deviates from the book. Sometimes this is done to condense a 400-page novel down to a two-hour film but in this film I saw changes that made no sense whatsoever. Another thing there is zero character development. When characters in the story get saved (I won't say who) the book makes it clear that it's a long soul-searching process. In the film it's quick and artificial. The book is written decently enough where people like Rayford Steele Buck Williams and Hattie Durham seem real but in the movie scenarios are consistently given the quick treatment without anything substantial. In another scene where one character gets angry about being left behind (again I won't say who) it seems artificial. I realize as a Christian it's unedifying for me to say I disliked this film but I can't in a good conscience recommend a film that I feel was horribly done. Perhaps it would've been better to make the first book into 2-3 films. Either way Christians need to realize that to be taken seriously as filmmakers we need to start by putting together a film in a quality way. I realize a lot of effort probably went into Left Behind but that's the way I see it. 
 Despite its interesting premise 'Sniper' is quite tedious. With a tighter script and sharper directing it could have been electrifying; instead it plods along with little tension. 
 Life in some future fascist or near fascist state which severely restricts personal freedoms is a recurrent theme both in modern literature and for film makers. Such works post us warnings about undesirable trends in our society to watch out for; but to be effective they must also be entertaining. Unfortunately most of the books are probably more effective in posting the warnings than in entertaining us enough to become really widely read; whilst with the films the problem is usually the other way round. The first such work to become really widely known was probably George Orwell's 1984 (first published in 1948) and this is still readily available both in the form of a book and as a film. Watch or read it: and then when you are feeling a little depressed by man's inhumanity to man reach for Cinderella 2000. This is a feather light low budget film comedy based on the same theme which provides effortless but unrewarding viewing; and as with 1984 the calendar has now passed beyond its erstwhile period. Most of the comedy is laid on with a trowel although there are just a few genuinely funny moments. To exercise your mind in the long intervals between these you can focus it on the question of whether this film will gain a new extension of life by being released as a DVD or whether it will finally disappear into oblivion as existing tape copies deteriorate past redemption. There are many worse films appearing as DVD's these days and frankly I do not care much what happens either way. So far the best of the films of this genre has probably been The Handmaiden's Tale but I would very happily swap them all for a well made film of Jack London's towering novel The Iron Heel . Ambitious as this would be it still seems incredible that no modern film maker has yet dared to attempt it (IMDb only lists a B/W silent version made in Russia in 1919). 
 This movie was poorly written poorly acted and very predictable. It was very low-budget and I can understand why it was never released and went straight to video. It wasn't even campy fun it was just a complete disaster and I wish I could get the 1-1/2 hours back! The colors were horrible along with the plot which has holes so big in it you could drive a mac truck through them. The plot itself had the young bride doing things that she absolutely was not physically capable of doing -- what a stretch! Skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre. Just about any movie comes to mind that is better than this. ejames6342 
 This movie was boring! Yes there are a few funny moments and jokes but you cannot base a whole movie on that! The characters are too stereotyped there is no real story - but short episodes with freaky side-characters who are not freaky enough to make the plot genuine. Shame because most of the actors are acknowledged in Hungary a mystery why they took the roles. This is *not* a new hope for the Hungarian film. It was boring though it was meant to be genuine or unique. They could have tried much more harder than this... 2 out of 10 
 Except for the better than average acting skills of the two leads this movie is really really bad. The cheap production values don't help. Of course you wouldn't really notice that the production values are cheap if they didn't keep trying to convince you they HAD a production values to begin with. Even for a B-movie genre freak like myself this movie really sucks. 
 Let me just say I loved the original Boogeyman. Sure it's a flawed clichd 80s horror movie but hey those types are fun to watch! And plus it gave us something a bit different. So I gladly bought it and to my surprise this movie came along with it (only copy they had actually) so I thought Eh what the hell and bought it. Mistake #1. So that night I felt in the mood to watch a movie (I actually bought tons that day) and figured this was the shortest out of all the ones I bought so I'll just watch this and hit the sack. Mistake #2. Yes I have heard how bad it was but I was willing to take a chance. So a few minutes into the movie and there's the first flashback. I think nothing of it at first. Then the new footage with the prediction of the chick in the bathtub and I'm kinda liking the direction it's going in. Then the next flashback which is a bit longer and I'm sitting there thinking Yes I've seen the first Boogeyman! I know what happens so move along! Then the next one comes up and I figure screw it and fast forward through it. Then the final one (Maybe I fast forwarded through the explanation but why was she lying topless on the mirror? At least she could've shown them!) and I decide to fast forward through it and then the climax and the movie was over! WTF? What happened to the prediction stuff? What happened to the long hair dude (Did he tap that or what?)? And more importantly what kind of weed was the writer and director smoking when making this awful POS??!!! And what was the point? Was Annie just having flashbacks of what happened in the first movie? Or was the stuff from the first movie just happening at the same time as this? The latter could make sense because the stabbing of Pantyhose Face happened in 1978 according to the characters in this movie and it was 15 years later. Wait a minute no it wouldn't! Because Lacey (who the movie questionably renamed Nancy! Is Uli too dumb to remember his movie characters' names?) would be 20 years old since she was 5 when that happened and not only is she married to someone who looks 30ish but also has a kid who looks around 7 and 10! Did she get around during middle school? And also why would Pantyhose be after Annie? What connection does she even have with the characters of the original movie? And a BIG HUGE MOVIE MISTAKE I found in this movie is that when the doctor is writing in his notebook does anyone notice that he's just SCRIBBLING? Wow how professional Doc! So what is the explanation for all of the questions I asked above? IT'S A POINTLESS MOVIE WITH NO THOUGHT PUT INTO IT AT ALL! I will try to find a copy of the original movie that comes with just that movie and that's it (Maybe a couple of extra features any Special Edition of it yet?). Then I will return this DVD and hopefully this review and all the others will prevent those who haven't seen it from seeing it thus making movie stores get rid of it and this movie may not exist anymore! Please let that be so! Sorry this review is so long. I'm just angry at this movie I had to vent somehow 
 I just rented this today....heard lots of good reviews beforehand. WOW!! What a pile of steaming poo this movie is!! Does anyone know the address of the director so I can get my five dollars back???? Finally someone bumped Stop-loss from the 'Worst Iraq War Movie Ever' number one spot. To be fair I don't think there are any good Iraq war movies anyway but this was REALLY bad. I won't get into any technical inaccuracies there's a hundred reviews from other GWOT vets that detail them all. If the director bothered to consult even the lowliest E-nothing about technical accuracy however they could've made the movie somewhat realistic....maybe. I guess the writer should be given the credit for this waste of a film. He or she obviously hatched the plot for this movie from some vivid imagination not afflicted with the restraints of reality. Does anybody but me wonder what the point of this movie was? Was there a message? Seriously though.....WTF???? I'm pretty amazed at all the positive reviews really. This film is hard to watch as a vet because of all the glaring inaccuracies but even if one could overlook that the plot sucks characters are shallow (to say the least) and the acting is poor at best. It's ironic I suppose that this movie is supposed to be about Explosive Ordinance Disposal because it's the biggest bomb I've seen this year. 
 I rarely write reviews for IMDb.com but I feel compelled to warn potential viewers that this movie is terrible. Just terrible. I like Shaw Bros. movies (I'm not a hater.) and I had high expectations for this one since I found it listed on many 10 Best Kung Fu/Martial Arts Movies websites. (I'm now convinced that those 10 Best lists are all cut-and-paste jobs.) First of all there's barely any action in the film. Most of the movie consists of talking about the plot which is an amazing feat because it's thin at best. And the action itself may have been impressive back in 1978 but it's routine by today's standards. A special warning to Netflix users: the DVD they ship is terrible; the picture is horrendous and it's not even 16:9 enhanced. 
 This is the worst sequel on the face of the world of movies. Once again it doesn't make since. The killer still kills for fun. But this time he is killing people that are making a movie about what happened in the first movie. Which means that it is the stupidest movie ever. Don't watch this. If you value the one precious hour during this movie then don't watch it. You'll want to ask the director and the person beside you what made him make it. Because it just doesn't combine the original makes of horror action and crime. Don't let your children watch this. Teenager young child or young adult this movie has that sorta impact upon people. 
 I could not believe how awful this film was; I rarely watch commercial TV but thought Well Diane Keaton is always worth watching . I stand corrected. Everyone involved should be hanging their heads in shame. I realize there are not a lot of great roles for women of a certain age but the script to this was so inept clichd and baffling that I am surprised it ever got into development or that Ms. Keaton thought she could make a silk purse out of this sow's ear. None of the characters had a shred of believability and were so incredibly unlikeable. The acting looked like exercises in a BEGINNING class - I stared in open-mouthed horror through most of this wondering What were they thinking? . Very very sad that it has come to this. Don't waste your time. 
 As has been noted this formula has been filmed several times most recently as You've Got Mail with Tom Hanks and Meg Trout Pout Ryan. Of the several versions this is my least favorite. The problem i think is that the studio coasted on the Stars charisma which doesn't quite cut it here. The chemistry betwixt the two leads never comes to a boil in this movie. There are no real sparks. Van Johnson and Judy Garland remind me of day old donuts pleasant but bland. And when the leads are boring the rest of the movie can only follow. Judy in particular is disappointing. She looks like she has no neck! I don't know if she was having trouble with pain or something but she looks like a turtle trying to pull it's head into it's shell all hunched up and everything. I couldn't figure out what Van Johnson was getting so hot about. I would have made a bee line for that cute violin player. And Van wasn't great either. I've always thought of him as a rather generic Hollywood leading man and he doesn't do anything to dispel that image here. If you're a fan of the stars or the early 1900's then you might like this movie. But there are a lot more entertaining romantic comedies out there and they offer you much more than a mouthful of stale confection. 
 Justifications for what happened to his movie in terms of distributors and secondary directors drunks and receptionists doing script rewrites aside let's just take this movie as it's offered without extraneous explanations. This movie is God awful. Straight up craptastic. Rather than rehash what may serve as a plot I'll run a highlight reel of some curious points that made me scratch my head. A class (of 5) take a field trip for a history class to the middle of friggin' nowhere Ireland. These students may be Canadian or American it's difficult to tell. That it was filmed in a Canadian forest rather than Ireland is rather obvious as well. One student seems to know nothing about history and is basically the dumb jock character from a number of kick ass 80's movie except when he channels Randy from Scream. One character may be Chris Klein's stunt double. He has a girlfriend who probably gets killed but it's never really established if that is true. One character is sullen and removed from her peers...just...cuz... and then there's a blonde girl. Yay blonde girl. Ireland has a population of 2. They're cousins. Gary who is clearly the same age or younger than the rest of the cast is called sir more than once. He's very ominous and wears a knit cap. His cousin is a roughed up porn star with the worst Irish accent to befoul film in my lifetime and most likely beyond. Picturesque Ireland features many Canadian forests and swampy areas and 2 ducks which appear more than once in cut scenes. The producers got a discount on volume fake entrails. Good for them. Unbeknownst to me horribly inbred freaks have access to brand spanking new hunting knives. Perhaps there's some kind of outdoorsman outlet nearby with a blind and deaf clerk working the register. Also unbeknownst to me if you inbreed for roughly 600 years as the story leads us to believe happened you end up being somewhat lumpy yet amazingly spry and fairly strong. Genetics are a wonderful game of craps. There may or may not be more than one freak in this film. Reference is made to them and we see shadows yet only one odd looking dude is seen ever. And when one odd looking dude is finally killed apparently all danger is passed. I'm running with my initial assumption that no one thought to outfit a second man in full make up thus they just used the one. That's what it looks like on screen anyway. Richard Grieco should be ashamed. Also of note aside from those shiny new knives the inbred freaks have access to some posh leather gear as once Richard Grieco cuts his bonds there are fresh ones ready for the next sucker who gets tied up...who also then escapes because the chains give you enough slack to just undo them making one wonder why they even bother tying anyone up. A dead body in a shack will be maggot-ridden after what I would guess is about 2 hours has passed. Said dead body will also have glasses on when no characters wore them. Curious. Jenna Jameson appears for no reason from stage left chats for 2 minutes vanishes stage left. In the middle of a giant forest. That's not unusual as Gary can also pop out of nowhere which is also known as whatever exists in TV land off the screen. Ms. Jameson dies sadly and somehow her clothes vanish like my hopes that this movie wouldn't suck wind. I offer a special nod to the Breeder character the poor girl who has been used by the freaks for months (or maybe years) for breeding purposes. The poor girl who still has eye shadow on and emotes on camera with all the passion and conviction of a stuffed chihuahua. The ending of this movie was clearly tacked on by a drunk or someone with a fierce mental disability that has been cultivated and encouraged with excessive gasoline drinking over the years. Apparently this wasn't just random crap I found on the movie network late at night apparently people have heard of and even followed this movie through it's production. How sad for you all. I have nothing more to say. May God have mercy on us all. 
 Fairly interesting exploitation flick in black and white written by David F. Friedman. The lead actress Stacey Walker is well-cast and strangely attractive. She resembles a deranged Renee Zellweger with a bad hair-do. This chick only made two of these films and then moved back to Texas. The music is terrible. One of her boyfriends is played by Sam Melville (from the TV show THE ROOKIES) using a different name. Best line in the film from Tony - Are you putting me on doll? None of my chicks put me on . Good B/W cinematography from Laslo Kovacs (EASY RIDER & TARGETS & many others). Good locales (cool swimming pool also used in THE DEFILERS). Strange ending but fitting. A 4 out of 10. Best performance Stacey Walker. 
 In an otherwise good review loleralacartelort7890 says The truth is that the Americans use a secret aluminum-anti-radiation-alloy. It is not that well-known. And the exact specifications are a secret. And why is it a secret: Well why should they reveal it back then?? If they where in a space race with the Russians then it would be VERY dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation. This is completely incorrect. There is (and was) no secret to radiation protection in Apollo. The design and construction of the Apollo Command Module has long been publicly available. It uses a lightweight honeycomb of aluminum and stainless steel. The entire outer surface (except the windows of course) is covered with a heat shield made of a phenolic resin thicker on the bottom that faces forward during re-entry. These materials are actually *better* at stopping the kind of radiation we have in space (charged particles) than lead which is better suited to stopping ionizing photons like X-rays and gamma rays. Space radiation is a definite problem for *long term* space flight because of the risk of big solar flares. But it simply wasn't a serious threat to the Apollo astronauts. The Command Module gave them pretty good protection during their brief (1/2 hour or so) passage through the Van Allen belts. They all carried dosimeters so we know exactly how much radiation they each received: no more than 1.5 rem and usually much less. Of the 24 men who flew to the Moon (12 of whom landed) 18 are still alive. Only two have died from cancer: Alan Shepard (leukemia) and Jack Swigert (bone cancer). The rest died from heart attacks pancreatitis (Roosa) and a motorcycle accident (Conrad). These are actually pretty good statistics for a group of men now in their late 70s (Shepard would be 86). 
 This movie introduces quite an array of characters and their relationships in the first half-hour or so. None of them generate any interest or positive response. I waited for the intrigue to begin hoping things would get better and ended up sticking around until the bitter end but there was no reward for doing that. If you want a synopsis look elsewhere. To me the action isn't worth recounting. Not that the story was that bad I guess you could say I had some problems with the script--i.e. I thought it stunk. A look at the credits will show you that there's a pretty strong cast here used to no avail. Most of the old pros in this flick do good jobs; of the actors I hadn't seen much of before I especially liked Deborah Kara Unger. That's about all that I can find good to say about this picture. 
 This film was a disaster from start to finish. Interspersed with performances from the next generation of beautiful losers are interviews with Bono and The Edge as well as the performers themselves. This leaves little time for the clips of Leonard Cohen himself who towers over everyone else in the film with his commanding yet gentle presence wisdom and humor. The rest are too busy trying to canonize him as St. Leonard or as some Old Testament prophet. Many of the performances are forgettable over-interpretations (especially Rufus & Martha Wainright's) or bland under-achievements. Only Beth Orton and Anthony got within striking distance of Leonard's own versions by using a little restraint. Annoying little pseudo-avant-garde gestures are sprinkled throughout the film- like out of focus superimpositions of red spheres over many of the concert and interview shots shaky blurred camera work use of digital delay on some of Leonard Cohen's comments (making it harder to hear what's being said) and a spooky pretentious low drone under a lot of the interview segments (an attempt at added gravitas?). For the real thing see the Songs From The Life Of documentary produced by the BBC in 1988. 
 Pros: Nothing Cons: Everything Plot summary: A female reporter runs into a hitchhiker that tells her stories about the deaths of people that were killed by zombies. Review: Never in my life have I come across a movie as bad The Zombie Chronicles. Filmed on a budget of what looks to be about 20 bucks TZC is a completely horrible horror movie that relies on lame forgetable actors whom couldn't act to save their lives and gore that's more gross than frightening. How does a movie like this even get made? Simply put avoid TZC like a sexually-transmitted disease. My last 2 cents: Humorously enough this movie was made by a movie company called Brain Damage Films. They're brains must have really been damaged to come up with a craptacular movie like this. My rating: 1 out of 10(If it were up to me this movie would get the rating of negative bajillion) 
 Another great movie by Costa-Gavras. It's a great presentation of the situation is Latin America and the US involvement in Latin American politics. The facts might or might not be accurate but it is a fact that the US was deeply involved in coups and support of Latin American dictatorships. Despite this though the spirit of the movie follows the typical leftist/communist propaganda of the Cold War era. Costa-Gavras is a well-known communist sympathizer and his movies are always biased. For example he presents the US actions as brutal and inhumane while representing Tupamaros' extremist activities as something positive. As it turned out it was a blessing for Uruguay and the rest of the Latin America that the US got involved. Europe is filled with poor East European prostitutes. I never heard of poor Uruguayan or Chilean girls prostituting themselves en masse as it happens in most East European countries. The US was fighting a dirty war and god bless us all the monster of Soviet Communism was defeated. It is unfortunate the US had to do what it did in Latin America (and elsewhere) but sometimes you need to play dirty. This is not an idealistic world as Costa-Gavras and Matamoros like to believe. Had Matamoros come to power in Uruguay we would've had another Ukraine in Latin America. All in all this movie follows corrupt and bankrupt leftist ideology of times past and tries to pass it as idealistic and morally correct. 
 I laughed all the way through this rotten movie. It's so unbelievable. A woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage has a breakdown in front of a real estate office. What happens? The office manager comes outside and offers her a job!!! Hilarious! Next thing you know the two women are going at it. Yep they're lesbians! Nothing rings true in this Lifetime for Women with nothing better to do movie. Clunky dialogue like I don't want to spend the rest of my life feeling like I had a chance to be happy and didn't take it doesn't help. There's a wealthy distant mother who disapproves of her daughter's new relationship. A sassy black maid - unbelievable that in the year 2003 a film gets made in which there's a sassy black maid. Hattie McDaniel must be turning in her grave. The woman has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty teenage kids. Sheesh! No cliche is left unturned. 
 ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Continued... From here on in the whole movie collapses in on itself. First we meet a rogue program with the indication we're gonna get ghosts and vampires and werewolves and the like. We get a guy with a retarded accent talking endless garbage two 'ghosts' that serve no real purpose and have no character what-so-ever and a bunch of henchmen. Someone's told me they're vampires (straight out of Blade 2) but they're so undefined I didn't realise. The funny accented guy with a ridiculous name suffers the same problem as the Oracle only for far longer and far far worse. He has a simple point about cause and effect makes it then continues to make it and make it until it becomes convoluted and stupid. His final line before walking off is comparable to Storm's do you know what happens to a toad... line in X-men in levels of utter bland baddness. The chocolate cake is such a lazy pathetic cliche and Monica Bellucci as the wife does nothing other than exactly what we expect the moment we see her. And then we get another kung fu fight!!! WHY? Neo is allegedly The One. He can do anything. He has the ultimate power and what does he use it for. Kung bloody fu all the time. And while he can stop 1000 bullets he still gets cut by a sword and still makes a meal of 5 undecipherable henchmen (vampires?). I wanted to see mind blowing powers. I wanted to see him do the wildest craziest most insane s*** to people because he can do anything. I got the same as before without the 'wow'. The fabled car chase. That can't be bad. Well... no it's not. It's just not what we've been tyold it was going to be. ALL the cool shots from this scene are in the trailer. Every one. So all possibly Wow has been taken from us so all we now get is a good chase sequence with guess what a kung fu fight!!! OK it's not Neo but you'd have thought he'd have explained to his closest friends about the reality of the Matrix. At least taught them something. It's not hard. Hey Morpheus don't worry about what happens to you in the matrix. It's not real. As long as you understand that nothing's real then nothing can really harm you. There you go. Simple. OK so the chase is not bad. It's never boring and it doesn't seem like 16 minutes. It's just so underwhelming. And still it gets worse. The final climax to the movie is quite probably the worst imaginable. They have this whole elaborate plan that involves three crews. They then only show it sporadically between Morpheus's over long super preachy monologue. To make it worse they never clearly define what this plan that needs 3 teams is. You know basically but you don't know who's doing what when so when one crew goes down you just don't care and you don't know how this is going to affect what goes on. I'll sum it up though it happens so Trinity can get back into the Matrix to setup the end. That's the only reason it happens. Which raises the question why did they need to send 6 people originally? Trinity gets in in five minutes by herself! Neo's journey to the centre of the Matrix (so to speak) is handled equally lazily. Ooohhh!!! He runs into another 100 Agent Smiths!!! Woooooo!!! That must've taken a lot of thought. Only now they're in a corridor so the fight has no scale and is over in a moment. Man what a grand finale!!! And then the Architect!!! Remember everything I said was bad about the Oracle and the foreign guy? Add them together and double it that's how truly appalling the Architect is. The only reasonable potential of him is he's about to set up the cliffhanging climax. And then he blows it! Let's look at the options he gives Neo. Choose one door and all humanity dies (except 27!!!). Choose the other and all humanity dies!!! Considering choice is something this film tries to explore it doesn't really give it's hero one. If he had a choice of Save humanity and the missus dies or Save the missus and kill humanity there's the potnetial for inner torment and tension. Also with Trinity being mid fall the potential of a real cliffhanger that would've made seeing the third more essential. But no. He has save no-one or save the missus. Now the very worst thing about the original Matrix was Neo dying and then coming back to life right at the end. The year it came out everyone was so annoyed by how stupid Jar Jar was they didn't notice that the very end of The Matrix made him look him Steven Hawking. The Oracle told me I'd fall in love with the One and I love you .... Come On!!!! How can the whole world have missed how utterly terrible that was? So what do the Wachowski's do in the sequel? Well they make the ending of the original look better. How? Well by doing almost exactly the same thing again (only swapping characters) only so much worse I think my f a and r keys would be worn out if I kept writing far before I got to worse. And the cliffhanger is just not really a cliffhanger. It's a reminder. Basically this film is just bad. I really didn't want it to be bad but it is. Bad in just so many ways. And to make matters worse this isn't a film with not enough budget. It's not a film with too short a schedule. It's not a film that's been rushed out. It's not a film where too much influence has come from the outside. This is exactly the film the Wachowski's set out to make with Warner's fortune fully behind them. And that's what makes this so awful. At least Rancid Aluminium can say that it didn't haev enough time or money. Matrix Reloaded. The worst film ever made? Maybe not quite. The most disappointing and defalting film ever made. Undeniably. 
 This movie could have been so much better especially considering the talent. Larenz Tate's portrayal of Frankie Lymon was not good especially in musical performances. He doesn't lip sync well and his stage mannerisms are Larenz Tate when he should have been Frankie Lymon. The portrayal of the women as a bunch of gold diggers has Hollywood written all over it. The powers that be obviously pushed it but it only made the characters more unrealistic. The positives of the movie were Miguel Nunez's portrayal of Little Richard and the cameo of Little Richard himself. Lela Rochon is eye candy as usual even in a conservative role. It's too bad that the talents of Halle Berry and Vivica A. Fox were wasted. The whole Frankie Lymon saga was fascinating in real life. Too bad this film was a wasted opportunity. 
 Let me give a quick summery of the film: A rotten rude kid named Max stumbles upon a radio that contains Kazaam: a rapping genie. Like all genies he grants 3 wishes but being good natured also helps Max with his personal life as he has to deal with bullies and a father mixed up in organized crime. During all this Kazaam raps from time to time (also showcasing Shaq's dismal rap skills). This movie proves what we all know: Athletes need to stick to sports. I admit that it never looked like an Oscar-worthy movie but EVERYTHING about this waste of film is horrible. The characters are either unlikable or stupid the plot is not even worth mentioning the dialog is a joke and Shaq is only a quarter of the problem. Hell even if Denzel Washington played Kazaam this movie would still be a joke. I know that the movie only drew ANYBODY was because Shaq was so big (no pun intended) at the time. I honestly cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this waste of time. Shaq should have put the time had used to make this movie toward practicing free throws. 
 As some other comments show this movie might scare you when you're a little child. (And that is probably all that it is good for.) However if you're older this movie only does one thing: suck majorly -and thereby I don't mean the acting its soundtrack cutting or s.th. like that. I'm simply talking about the plot (if you can call it that). SPOILERS ahead ------------------------ I don't want to give any more spoilers than necessary (if after reading this you really still want to watch this movie) but if you graduated from any school this is just a big insult of your intelligence. When watching this I was stunned most of the time because what was happening was just THAT stupid. This includes: -the forming of UNITE (an evil UN-association) --> we are just supposed to believe it's evil. is it even evil at all? if so: why is it evil? -the mark of evil in the form of a tattoo --> there is no necessity to impose this on the people so why the hell (no pun intended) are they doing it? -inviting Christ to your heart merely as lip service -->because there's nothing anybody who in this movie is considered a real Christian ever does besides saying that stupid prayer. so...just say that prayer before the rapture and you're saved - no matter what?! Thus rating 1/10 
 Hey Arnold! is a slow-paced and slightly boring movie. The plot is not very creative. The Paul Sorvino character (Shenk) is buying all of the decrepit low-priced buildings in order to build a gigantic mall shopping complex and office buildings. This plot goes back to many 1960s kids movies. It is boring. Paul Sorvino is not very exciting either so the idea of him as the bad guy is not very scary. Gramps remembers something about a historical document and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal must find the document with the undercover aid of Helga whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to Shenk's Mall. The kids must move around town on buses and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only silly but underscores how this movie is written for very young kids. Hey Arnold the TV cartoon is usually very entertaining and it has enough humor to appeal to adults. The TV cartoon is usually faster paced and more imaginative than this movie. Hey Arnold the movie is about five times more sedated and a good way to put anyone including kiddies to sleep. Hey Arnold was a tough one to stay awake all the way until the predictable and totally boring ending. If you want to send your kids to a totally non-offensive movie this is it. I get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie the producers started out with a 30 minute TV cartoon script and tried to expand it into 90 minutes. This Mall Story definitely could have been covered in the TV cartoon. Hopefully Arnold will bet a better writer if there is ever a sequel. 
 I was really horrified by this eerie movie. What an unusual dark atmosphere. And such a creepy musical score. Really promising! Indeed after ten minutes you really start sweating and feeling uncomfortable for you start fearing the worst. This movie has the atmosphere of a true nightmare and what's worse-it all comes out. For one hour and a half I have been trying to fight complete boredom and falling asleep but the monstrous soundtrack kept me awake. Nuit Noire is a truly horrifying picture - for your eyes your ears your intelligence and most of all: your wallet since the thought of spending precious money on a movie ticket for this cheap amateuristic homevideo is the biggest horror of all. 
 The only thing that prevented this flick from being a total disaster were a couple of interesting stylish touches. (Moderate Spoiler Alert) Death by comic is a bit derivative of a scene in Twilight Zone: The Movie which delivers death by cartoon. Still this was handled nicely especially watching the ink bleed and the color being sapped out. Additionally there is one other good scene with a demon motorcycle. Having said that I was glad I got the DVD cheap at a store going out of business sale because this was pretty awful. I bought Soul Survivors at the same time and both movies were similarly annoying with the constant realizations that you have been watching a dream. However where Soul Survivors has nothing to redeem it or have it make any sense this at least had a couple of stylish notes referred to above. Interestingly the DVD lets you go to the 8 'nightmares' where something actually happens which is the only way to watch this. The scripting between the creative gore moments is rather unbearable. 3 out of 10. 
 First before reading further you must understand that I'm not neo-nazi I'm just trying to understand correctly Hitler to be sure nobody like him take power again. I've seen this series and found it awful. I mean OK it's interesting to look but is it real? I searched for answers and found one: absolutely not. First Hitler wasn't angry all his life the series shows an angry Hitler even when he is a child. Second Hitler never wanted to abuse his daughter in fact it is highly probable that Hitler in reality was gay and fought all his life to choke this secret. Third people will hate me but it's true: Hitler was charming. How do you think he managed to get to power if he was so hateful and ugly? Because he was charming. That's a common point I found in the interviews of people who live near or far of him (of course not Jews). This series was awful because if you think that Hitler was just an angry bastard ugly and of course not charming at all you're wrong. If you think that you will let people like him take power in countries and you don't want that. If you really understand how Hitler managed to get into power and stop thinking he was just awful you'll be able to find dangerous politicians like him (of course remember he was elected) and stop theme before it's too late. Life is important to protect this series is just awful to show us the truth if we continue to see Hitler like that another one will take place exactly as the first did. 
 Being an independent filmmaker and a huge fan of Edward D. Wood Jr. I purchased this documentary believing that this would finally set the record straight on how gifted and brilliant Ed Wood actually was. What I got was a disappointing self-centered conflictive contradictory compilation of bitter self-aggrandizing has-beens. Where people DO remember Ed Wood Jr. do people actually remember the second cousin of the guy with the duct tape who knew someone who was in Plan Nine From Outer Space? It appears as though the very minute there is a renewed interest in Ed Wood these people come out of the Wood work! Only to take mean spirited swipes at someone who actually gave them a chance when no-one else would! After 50 years I would suggest that many of these people should let go of the fact that they didn't get the $75 they were promised! Ed Wood was a brilliant creative filmmaker who knew how to entertain. In-fact that was ALL he lived for. You may giggle when you see Ed's films but somehow you are aware that you are laughing WITH him and not AT him. But I digress... Back to the film at hand. If you are expecting a film ABOUT Edward D. Wood Jr. you won't get it here. If you want a film about cranky bitter old actors this is the film for you! 
 I'm not a regular viewer of Springer's but I do watch his show in glimpses and I think the show is a fine guilty pleasure and a good way to kill some time. So naturally I'm going to watch this movie expecting to see Jerry Springer Uncensored. First of all Jerry appears in approximately twenty minutes of the film's running time. The other hour and twenty minutes is spent building up this pseudo-farce about trailer-trash jealousy incest and deception. Jaime Pressley (who looks hot as HELLLL) is a trailer-trash slut who sleeps with her stepfather (a very unusual-looking chain-smoking drunken Michael Dudikoff who finally strays from his action hero persona). The mom finds out about the affair they get into a fight they want to take it to the Jerry show (that's right no Springer). And then we have a parallel story with an African-American couple. They take it to the Jerry show. The characters collide. Blah blah freakin' blah! Trash has rarely been this BORRRINGG!!!! I was wondering why the hell Springer has millions of fans yet none of them checked out his movie. Well now it's TOTALLY obvious!! Whether you love him or hate him you will hate this movie! How can I explain? It's a total mess of a motion picture (if that's what you call it). It's so badly edited with scenes that just don't connect and after a period of time the plot virtually disappears and it's simply all over the map! Just imagine a predictable soap opera transformed into a comic farce. With seldom laughs. My only positive note is a hot girl-girl scene. That's as risque as it gets. Don't get me wrong the scene's pretty risque but if you look at the overall film comparing it to the material on Springer's program--this disastrous farce seems extremely sanitized. My score: 3 (out of 10) 
 SPOILERS HEREIN My High School did all they could to try and motivate us for exams. But the most memorable method they used to get us into the right state of mind was a guest speaker who was none other than Australian Kickboxing's favorite son Stan The Man Longinidis. The first mistake they made was giving this guy a microphone because he was screaming half the time despite us sitting no more than 3 or 4 feet away from him. Now his speech was full of the usual if you fail to prepare then prepare to fail stuff but there were various instances where I got really worked up. The guy stood there in front of us preaching how throughout his life he did everything for himself and no-one else. He was offered many deals in the past to give up kick-boxing but he never took his eye off the prize of becoming Australia's greatest kick-boxer. He said that he wasn't a sell-out he was happy and a retiree he wasn't ever involved in any other activity other than Kickboxing? then he plugged his film. Yes you heard right he PLUGGED his new FILM. As he talked about it he got a woman to come in and hold up a poster advertising it and then he showed this shitty 4 minute clip of this vile film called Trojan Warrior . (This all being before he was defeated by Gurkan Ozkan in his final career fight (for now)) Stan plays Ajax a kick-boxing ex-special forces agent that is pulled into the seedy underworld of Melbourne. Ajax's cousin Theo (Arthur Angel) recently sold out (well at least Stan didn't stray too far away from EVERYTHING) to the feds and as a result is on the run from all walks of organized crime. Ajax and Theo get into all sorts of ridiculous situations from fighting in a Kebab shop to posing as playboys at a bondage party. It's all pretty ridiculous but if Silverstein was actually aiming to make a credible film here this man should never be handed a camera again. I'll admit I was actually pumped to see this. I love action films even if they're corny and especially if it's set in my own backyard. But what I was introduced to was a film with acting that was appalling from the word go and continued to do so after the words for the love of God please make it stop! subplots were introduced and not even touched on again after they were out in the open characters were just thrown in for absolutely NO reason whatsoever and the most over-choreographed fight scenes that didn't even remotely reflect Stan's actual talent in Kickboxing. The cast consisted of useless cameo appearances by just about anyone REMOTELY famous (Dermot Brereton Mark Chopper Read and Greg Matthews). The whole time you're sitting there and playing the guessing game of just who is standing there in the background. Too bad the movie relies heavily on split-second appearances by former celebrities. Remember those plot-holes I told you about? Ajax once upon a time was apparently locked up wrongly accused for murdering his wife. Now we hear that Ajax was in special forces via ONE single sentence in the WHOLE film and then leave it for buggery. This is followed by another SINGLE sentence which persuades Ajax to help the same people who wrongly locked him up. Then get this at the end it is revealed to Ajax that his wife isn't actually dead but was sold into prostitution. Do we see her? No. Does Ajax go off to find her as soon as he hears this? No. Now THAT's a marriage! Amidst all this irritatingly puerile crap some website described this film as ?a cross between Jackie Chan & Guy Ritchie? . Has this man ever sat down and watched a Jackie Chan film?! Chan shows more dexterity taking a dump than Stan did doing? well ANYTHING! And Guy Ritchie is the crime-film Messiah and you're comparing him to Salik Silverstein!? This film is more like a mix between Pizza and Enter The Ninja . Now where do you thing the whole Trojan Warrior title comes from? Ajax's fierce fighting skills like that of an Ancient Greek Warrior? No. The gangsters' unification to find Theo like that of the Trojan Empire? No. It's because? wait for it? Theo carries a condom around with him. Yes that right because THEO is ALWAYS PREPARED with a Trojan BRAND RUBBER in his pocket he is a Trojan WARRIOR! I had the displeasure of seeing Trojan Warrior on DVD as well as it's special features: ? Video clip of Chop Chop a rap song by Mark Chopper Read: Chopper did this for the sole purpose of proving that ANYONE can rap. The funny thing was Chopper just rapped for 30 seconds and then threw it over to these two albino teens from Doncaster using such words as dis and dope etc in their Australian accents. Face it people rap was developed in the States LEAVE IT THERE! The clip looked like something a Channel 31 cameraman on ecstasy put together. ? Bloopers: There was no real difference between these and the actual film. ? Stan The Man Longinidis Kickboxing Featurette: This wasn't too bad considering it was just 6 or 7 different fights shown from different angles (I think I saw Dennis Alexio fall over about 15 times in that 3 minute montage). I don't want to say this film contributes to the reason this country is going to hell when it comes to film but... oh wait I just did. My advice to anyone reading this is for you to go out and buy 4 or 5 copies of Trojan Warrior tape them together and use it for a paperweight because this movie is just that damn bad. 
 Half Past Dead starring Steven Seagal in the main role was a major B-hit. Half Past Dead 2 is just a direct-to-video sequel an action movie with nothing lose but with no capacity to win something. It's less entertaining than the first one: in all aspects. But it's although worthy a look. If you like action movies or just something to watch during a popcorn session; if you also like to watch former WWE stars on screen or even if you love to watch sequels even if they are direct or not. Kurupt did a good job Bill Goldberg was below the average I think he isn't made to the job. Kurupt is a good comedian I say. The rest did the job but nothing amazing nothing far from alright. Technical details well a production made by Sony can't be great. Cinematography was a disaster but overall direction was acceptable. Whatever just watch it if you want. If you watch you won't lose anything. But if you don't... well you won't lose either. 
 i saw this movie at the toronto film festival with fairly solid expectations. the movie has a great cast and was closing at the festival so it must be good right? how wrong i was. i knew we were in trouble when before the film the director was talking about how when he was directing an episode of wiseguy he met an unknown actor named kevin spacey (a director/writer of wiseguy making his feature debut = blah)... well the director/writer of Edison must have some incriminating pictures of kevin spacey killing a homeless man because i cannot see how he (along with the other actors in the film) would ever agree to be in this disaster. this movie is absolutely appalling! it's a mixture of every cop hard boiled clich ever. there is nothing new with Edison. the acting was bad and the direction was even worse. it looked like that aforementioned episode of wiseguy. this was the best casted direct to video movie i've ever seen. some examples of just bad silly moments in Edison... morgan freeman dancing around his apartment for no reason to rock and roll music... justin timberlake getting creative criticism from his belle while his apartment is surrounded by candles... llcoolj driving a vintage firebird... 3 guys being shot in the head... this movie is the opposite of good. STAY AWAY FROM EDISON! 
 Zodiac Killer. 1 out of 10. Worst acting ever. No really worst acting ever. David Hess (Last House on the Left?. No the one from the seventies?. Rent it it's really good) is the worst of the bunch (Pretty stiff competition but he is amazingly god-awful.) One would be hard pressed to find a home movie participant with such an awkward camera presence. The film actually screeches to a stunning painful halt when he is on the screen. Not that the film actually has any redeeming qualities for Mr. Hess to ruin. It is filmed with a home movie camera and by the looks of things a pretty old one complete with attached boom mike. No post production either. Come on there has to be some shovelware a five year old computer could use that could clean up this picture. Throw in bizarre stock footage pictures of autopsy's and aircraft carrier takeoffs and this is one visually screwed up picture. The autopsy pictures are interjected the way Italian cannibal films interject those god-awful real life animal killings. And the Navy footage is supposed to be some anti war statement (Cause we know all the bloodthirsty maniacs join the Navy) What in the world is Lion's Gate is doing releasing this garbage? It would embarrass Troma. The plot is about the Zodiac Killer (Last seen in Dirty Harry ?. No the one from the seventies?. Rent it it's really good) Somebody gets shot in the stomach in LA and the cops assume the Zodiac Killer is back? Uh-huh. What can you expect from a movie that doesn't know that DSM IV is a book not a psychiatric disorder and where the young killer older man relationship resembles that of a congressional page and closeted congressman? Yeah eighties haircuts and production values meet a Nambla subplot. Sign me up. 
 First of all Jenna Jameson is the best actress in this movie and she's just awful. This movie has every horror move clich in imagination and all badly played. The over-sexed teen couple. The comical(not)horny jock. The snotty cool chick. The creepy local color guy. The parental-type couple. The virginal chick who amazingly never dies in these films. The dialogue is so painfully awful and delivered with the depth of a wading pool. It's almost like you're wishing that they'd all die sooner. I saw the rough cut of this film a while ago but somehow this just got worse. Sure the funniest thing in here is the ghoul trying to eat Jameson's implants but that hardly rates even a rental of this dog. Avoid at all costs. 
 Carriers follows the exploits of two guys and two gals in a stolen Mercedes with the words road warrior on the hood hightailing it down the highway for the beach with surfboards strapped to the top of their car. Brian (Chris Pine of Star Trek ) is driving and his girlfriend Bobby (Piper Perabo of Coyote Ugly )has shotgun while Brian's younger brother Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci of Fanboys ) and his friend--not exactly girlfriend--Kate (Emily VanCamp of The Ring 2 ) occupy the backseat. This quartet of twentysomething characters are living in a nightmare. Apparently a viral pandemic--which co-directors & co-scenarists Alex Pastor and David Pastor tell us absolutely nothing about--has devastated America. Naturally the lack of exposition shaves off at least fifteen minutes that would have slowed down this cynical melodrama about how humans degenerate in a crisis and become their own worst enemies. This lethal virus gives you the shingles and then you bleed and die. Most everybody runs around wearing those white masks strapped to their nose and mouth by a thin rubber band. Initially this foursome encounters a desperate father Frank (Christopher Meloni of Runaway Bride ) and his cute little daughter Jodie (Kiernan Shipka of Land of the Lost ) blocking the highway with their SUV. Brian swerves around Frank when he tries to waylay them but in the process the oil pan in their Mercedes ruptures and they wind up on foot. Reluctantly they hitch a ride with Frank after they seal Jodie up in the rear of the SUV. She wears a mask over her nose and mouth and it is speckled with blood. Frank has heard that doctors are curing ailing people at a hospital and they head to it. Sadly somebody has lied to Frank. The hospital physician is giving the last couple of kids some Kool-Aid that will put them out of their misery. The cure did not improve their condition. Everybody else in town is dead. Kate tries without success to get a dial tone on every phone. Frank realizes that there is no hope for his daughter and he lets the heroic quartet appropriate his SUV and take off. Indeed Carriers qualifies as a relentlessly depressing movie about the effects of a pandemic on four sympathetic people who degenerate into homicidal murderers to protect themselves. They reach a country club and frolic around on a golf course until another four show up in suits and masks with pump-action shotguns. Incredibly our protagonists manage to escape without getting shot but Brian has a scare when he almost falls into the water with a floating corpse. Eventually they discover that one of them has become infected. Later as they are about to run out of gas Brian blocks the highway like Frank did at the outset. Danny tries to stop a pair of older Christian women driving the car. Danny lies that his pregnant wife is about to give birth and he needs their help. Brian throws caution to the wind and blasts away at the ladies with his automatic pistol when they refuse to help them. Brian catches a slug in the leg from the passenger but he kills her. No Carriers is not a beer & pizza movie that you can either laugh off or laugh with because the humor is virtually non-existent. By the end of this 84-minute movie our heroes have turned into villains who only care only for themselves and their plight. Chris Pine makes quite an impression as fun-loving Brian and his energetic performance is the only reason to hang with this hokum while the only other well-known actress Piper Perabo is relegated to an inconsequential girlfriend role. As Bobby she makes tragic the mistake of showing compassion to a dying little girl and pays an awful price. It is a testament to Pine's performance that he can change his character to the point of putting himself before others. Essentially Pine has the only role that gives him the ability to pull a one-eighty from happy-go-lucky guy to heartless guy. The two directors are Spanish brothers and they never let the momentum flag. Since there is no relief in sight Carriers sinks into predictability. Irrversible cinematographer Beno?t Debie does a fantastic job with his widescreen lensing and as unsavory as this road trip becomes Debie makes it look like a dynamic film. Aside from the lack of a happy ending or closure in any sense of the word Carriers suffers because it is so horribly cynical. The scene when the German shepherd attacks Danny conjures up the most suspense but even it could have been improved. Unfortunately the Pastor brothers do not scare up either much tension or suspense. By fade-out you really don't care what happens to anybody. 
 It's funny when you stop and think about it: fright film fans tend to a deep and abiding affection toward those who scare the daylights out of them. THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE may give us nightmares but who among us (the Faithful) didn't feel a very real twinge of love for Gunnar Hansen in BRUTAL MASSACRE- or for Ken Foree forever and ever the resolute hero of the original DAWN OF THE DEAD? His cameo in the remake made me want to stand up and cheer (as did Tom Savini's cameo); I kid you not. And Brian Halloran and... Well you get my drift (if not just stand downwind...). These are some of the Heroes of Horror. To see this many of them gathered together in a single movie is almost unheard of (at least to this degree to my knowledge). If only the writer(s) had been up to such a monumental task. Maybe someone else somewhere along the line will try again. As long as it's not another half-hearted effort (like BROTHERHOOD OF BLOOD for instance). 
 Ally McBeal was a decent enough show but it was very overrated. The characters become boring after a while and the jokes begin to fall short. I think it chose an appropriate point in time to leave - it was starting to outstay its welcome. 
 Before watching this film I had very low expectations and went to just see the cars. Eventually I even regretted going for that reason. Plot is almost non-existent. Character development is non-existent. So many clichs and so much jaw-dropping cheesiness existed in the movie that I could only stare and wonder how it was even released. If not for the exotics I wouldn't have even rated this movie a 1. An attempt at a coherent story line is destroyed by the sheer absurdity of this elite racing cult and the laughable characters that make up its members. In fact the movie's plot is so predictable and simple-minded that an average child could foretell the majority of the storyline. Bad acting bad plot bad jokes bad movie. Don't see it. Play Gran Turismo HD instead and it'll satiate your thirst for fast sexy cars without leaving a bad aftertaste. 
 This movie has many problem associated with it that makes it come off like a low budget class project from someone in film school. I have to give it credit on its campiness though. Many times throughout the movie I found myself laughing hysterically. It was so bad at times that it was comical which made it a fun watch. If you're looking for a low-grade slasher movie with a twist of psychological horror and a dash of campy ridiculousness then pop a bowl of popcorn invite some friends over and have some fun. I agree with other comments that the sound is very bad. Dialog is next to impossible to follow much of the time and the soundtrack is kind of just there. 
 This film was absolutely awful I even feel uncomfortable calling it a film. Its the typical mumblecore movie with zero plot and a bunch of aimless whiny twenty somethings stumbling around trying to figure stuff out . I have tried to give mumblecore a chance but lets be honest its just horrible. I am not out of sync with cinema I appreciate Dogme95 films Idioterne is one of my all time favorite films. So I do not mind if a film is cheaply made so long as there is some (ANY) substance. Everything in this film is horrid the acting the writing (or was it all improvised?) the direction but MOST of all above everything else the camera work was just plain and simple nonsense. The camera was never anywhere logical there was no consistency. I got to admit being a guy I had heard there was nudity in this film so I thought to myself well even if its horrible at least there's nudity (yea I know I'm a jerk). Well thanks to the uber crappy camera-work you never really get to see anything and the things you do see TRUST ME - YOU DO NOT WANT TO SEE. This film made me want to vomit on numerous levels. The dialogue made me want to vomit the camera-work made me want to vomit but mostly the idea that this film was praised by some legit critics well now that more than anything makes me want to vomit. 
 No this wasn't one of the ten worst films of the 1980's but it certainly skirts the bottom 100 somewhere. This movie looks like it was put on the shelf for two or three years and then released in 1981. How else would you explain special effects pre-dating An American Werewolf in London disco still being considered cool and Ronald Reagan not being the 40th President of the United States? While we're at it let's not overlook those 1970's hairstyles in the 1950's and '60's. I've seen more of that here than in Happy Days & Laverne & Shirley combined. The one woman who elevates this movie to the so bad it's good category was the late great Elizabeth Hartman but just barely. Biff plays as Miss Montgomery the mousey high school teacher who becomes a sexpot a stereotype that's been done to death and is still being churned out by Hollywood today but even as a hot chick she retains her mousey qualities. Her call for help is evidence of this. She also looks much better as Miss Wimp. Seven bucks at the beauty parlor shot to hell. She wasn't kidding. This isn't to say that there aren't any good parts elsewhere they're just few and far between and I'm not just saying that because I like Hartman. Incidentally Teen Wolf was better than this. Teen Wolf Too was better than this and that wasn't even so good. 
 We gave up at the point where George Clooney's character has his finger-nails extracted. We were not squeamish - having sat through an hour of this drivel we just knew what it felt like. To say this film was incomprehensible boring pretentious twaddle would be to over-praise it! How did people manage to sit through this confusing slow depressing pseud's corner of a film let alone nominate it for an Oscar? Clooney looked as ill as we felt watching him. What was he thinking? Oh .. and what was with those subtitles? - did we just have a dud DVD or was the original film done like that - sentences left hanging in mid-air? The film was hard enough to follow without that as well. I pity the cast who obviously did their best with the material available. 
 I really do fail to see the actual surplus value of this movie. It's not bad enough to be hilarious. There's no sleaze or gratuitous nudity (although there was plenty of opportunity). There's no gore. There's no suspense in the first hour of the movie 'cause there's way to much scenes of tourist having a party and natives playing funky tribal music. That last part was actually funny on many occasions: You see these natives hitting congas and 'jembs' and that's indeed what you hear (badly synchronized) on the soundtrack. But they also added this funky bass-line on the soundtrack. So where was the bass-player? At one point the natives get angry and start killing the tourists. Why all of the sudden? It's supposed to be because the evil white men build this tourist complex which according to their myth awakened the wrath of the river-alligator-god (I actually missed the explanation for that one). But the natives did help for several months to build the tourist complex so why the sudden angriness? And how in the hell did they manage to push the helicopter in the water??? It's all silly and pointless. This movie also features the skinniest Afro-American model I've ever seen. At one point our heroic leading couple visits this cave where a weird crazy old man lives. The only point to that scene is that they make the shocking discovery that the killer-crocodile is actually an alligator. Crocodile or alligator what's the difference? It's big it's made out of plastic and it eats people. All the same to me. The alligator is a rather silly creation. It's very stiff & motionless and doesn't even flap its feet when it swims. The eyes don't even move when they're shot in close-up. I guess they didn't know 'animatronics' back then in Italy during 1979. There's also a lot of pointless inter-cut shots of the local wildlife. I suspect it's stock footage. Like I said the first hour was pretty lame and the only reason I didn't switch off the movie was because my cat was asleep on my lap and I didn't want to wake the sweet thing. But the last half hour of the movie did get better. We finally get to see some action when the alligator swims through a horde of panicking people snapping its teeth and munching on them. The most entertaining (and at the same time funny) scene is when Alice and Daniel drive a van over a bridge and it collapses. We're looking at a matchbox-version of the van falling in the river here. Funny. But nicely shot. In fact there are several other nice traveling camera-moves. Surprisingly for this type of flick. I was gonna point out some stupid details concerning the end of the movie but I don't wanna spoil it completely in case you do decide to watch this movie. My advice is to stay away from it. If you wanna see a decent alligator movie then see Lewis Teague's ALLIGATOR. I admit that one isn't Italian and isn't a JAWS rip-off but it certainly is more fun. And if you're interested in other movies made by director Sergio Martino then I strongly recommend the highly entertaining 2019: AFTER THE FALL OF NEW YORK. That one's an over-the-top rip-off of every possible existing post-apocalyptic-future-of-doom-movie. Italians and rip-offs two words that go together very well. 
 Except people apparently buy into this garbage! As shows like Moral Orel have shown even if you tried to make the most outrageous over-the-top parody of evangelism you could possibly think of it wouldn't come close to the hilarity of this show. It's hard to tell what's even going on when you're watching it. Is it a news show? A talk show? Who knows!? They start out by reporting on various international news stories but at seemingly random points the news is interrupted by this odd troll-like little man with a forehead bigger than his entire face mumbling and laughing and generally being creepy. Pat Robertson doesn't even seem like such a bad guy at first glance. He just seems like a senile yet harmless old coot stuck in his archaic beliefs (like most of our grandparents). But this is a man who has called for an assassination who has befriended and offered aid to not one but TWO murderous dictators who has illegally used donation money to run diamond mines who has SUPPORTED forced abortions in China and who regularly implies that Caucasians (straight American male Caucasians in particular) are superior to all other races. Still this would all be funny except that he apparently has a large enough fan base to keep his little show on the air 40 years later (either that or enough money to bribe some TV executives who don't give a damn what they show). The idiocy of the show becomes alarming when you realize that some people somewhere must be watching it and hanging onto every word. Even when Robertson has repeatedly shown how corrupt he is people still listen to him. I don't know if it's funny or scary. I guess a healthy mixture of both. 
 I had high hopes for this film. I thought the premise interesting. I stuck through it even though I found the acting save Helena Bonham Carter unremarkable. I kept hoping my time spent would pay off but in the end I was left me wondering why they even bothered to make this thing. Maybe in George Orwell's version there is a message worth conveying. If this film accomplished anything it has inspired me to read Orwell's classic. I find it hard to believe his tale could be as disappointing as this adaption. If the film maker's message is the mundane life is worth living well then they've succeeded. I would recommend this film to no one; 101 minutes of my life wasted. 
 It is incredible that with all of the countless crimes that have been uncovered and laid unequivocally at the doorstep of Marxism from the Berlin Wall to the Gulag archipelago to the Cultural Revolution to the Khmer Rouge one still finds admirers of Communist totalitarianism in Hollywood and are still making propaganda in its favor. It just shows the moral depravity of Hollywood. In this particular film a psychotic murderer is glorified. Needless to say that neither his crimes nor his psychotic proclamations were included. That both the director and the actor expect audiences to sit through this seemingly interminable propagandistic film demonstrates the tunnel vision that they have in regards to their object of worship. 
 Just saw this movie on TV and I have to admit I was a bit surprised it was even on. There were so many goofs mess-ups and bad editing that an old episode of Sesame Street would have been better to watch. The acting was OK but please you can really feel the Straight to Video feeling. The cast/crew made this movie a bad melodrama. Yes there is a message in the movie but just wait until ten minutes before the ending to hear it. Trust me you wouldn't even tell the difference. 
 I don't know who to blame the timid writers or the clueless director. It seemed to be one of those movies where so much was paid to the stars (Angie Charlie Denise Rosanna and Jon) that there wasn't enough left to really make a movie. This could have been very entertaining but there was a veil of timidity even cowardice that hung over each scene. Since it got an R rating anyway why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene shot with a 70-year-old woman and not Angie Harmon? Why does Sheen sleepwalk through potentially hot relationships WITH TWO OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND SEXY ACTRESSES in the world? If they were only looking for laughs why not cast Whoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenuta instead? This was so predictable I was surprised to find that the director wasn't a five year old. What a waste not just for the viewers but for the actors as well. 
 One of the worst movies I've seen shoddy camera work crappy filter usage film was grainy script was terrible i mean come on how predictable was the big battle at the end..... some of the fight scenes were okay i guess.... some scenes were so bad it was comical ...like Sorbo getting the horse and riding at the end...LOL i mean really ..a horse? Oh cant forget how the bad assassins roll around in the same vehicle throughout the entire movie..one would think that after killling key witness and federal agents they woulda been tracked down..ETC ETC really don't bother watching it... 
 Jane Eyre_ is one of the greatest novels in the English language and this screenwriter should of read it. I hate it when writers use Spark notes for what a novel is all about. This movie is unbearable to watch if you have read the book. The whole 'red room' is so down played that I wonder why they even bother to put it in. In the book the 'red room' is foreshadowing for the WHOLE story and the rest of Jane's life. Helen Burns is treated so badly in the movie I'm sure she was happy to die and leave early. In the book she is one of the most compelling characters and she was not the red head. The whole Christian theme is missing from her life and the rest of the movie. Do yourself a favor and miss this movie and read the story as Charlotte Bronte masterfully told it. 
 Since its release in 1983 A Christmas Story the Jean Shepherd-narrated story of his alter-ego Ralphie has become a true classic. My Summer Story however still has Shepherd as the narrator but it has absolutely none of the charm and the characters are nowhere near the caliber of the original film. My Summer Story is basically a mishmash of mediocre and just plain not very interesting stories which include hillbilly neighbors and battling tops. Charles Grodin who I normally like is extremely unlikeable in the role of the father (more aptly handled by Darren McGavin in the original) and his character never seems anything but forced. Kiernan Culkin is a poor substitute for Ralphie and the little brother is all but forgotten here. Only mom seems to have any worth here and perhaps that's because she beans a cinema manager with a gravy boat when he pushes his luck too far with irate housewives on free dish night . The stories in this are mostly inconsequential and stretched paper-thin. May appeal to the extremely undemanding but as a sequel to A Christmas Story it's a very poor one and not worth most people's time. 2 out of 10. 
 Bamboo House of Dolls (1973 1974 or 1977 various years are given for this title) is a Hong Kong veteran Chin Hung Kuei's (Killer Snakes Boxer's Omen Payment in Blood etc.) women in prison flick produced by the legendary Shaw Brothers. Yes even they got their hands into low exploitation sickies like this and Bamboo is definitely among the worse attempts of the whole genre even when compared to the Western attempts that usually pale in comparison with the Eastern films! The story is about a Japanese war camp in which the Chinese women are brutalized abused and raped by the bad Japanese (what else?) during the World War II. The girls also know a secret place in which a box full of gold is hidden and also learn that a Chinese military officer raised in Japan (Shaw veteran Lo Lieh) is actually now an undercover agent among the other Japanese and naturally helps the girls escape the hell. What follows is sequences full of gratuitous nudity female kung fu some nasty torture gore sleaze and extremely offensive anti Japan attitude that make this film pure and honest garbage that doesn't even try to be more than it is. There are hardly any interesting elements in Bamboo House of Dolls. The occasional photography especially at the end looks nice with its sunbeams and beautiful nature but that's about it in the merits department. The fight scenes are plenty and always include half naked females hitting and kicking each other. The violence overall is quite nasty at times with several bullet wounds misogynistic torture scenes (for example one poor girl is brutalized on the floor filled with broken glass etc.) and extremely repulsive ending and moral behind it. Of course it is stupid to talk about moral when writing about this kind of film but still there are elements I won't accept to be found from any film. The film has also some enjoyable turkey elements for sure! For example the gold box filled with heavy gold seems suspiciouly light as the weak and suffered girls don't seem to have any problems lifting and moving it not to speak of throwing it! Also those numerous skin fight scenes make this quite smile inducing for fans of trash cinema. I have seen the same director's Killer Snakes (1973) which is ten times more noteworthy as a piece and even though it has many alive snakes killed for real it is also visually more interesting and shows us some nasty sides of the other side of the big city and society. Also it is a must for those who fear snakes. Bamboo House of Dolls has suffered some censorship too which isn't a surprise considered the subject matter. The uncut version (dubbed into a non-English language) released in Europe at least in France Italy and Switzerland runs 104 PAL minutes while the cut English dubbed print released in Holland Belgium and Greece runs only 84 minutes in PAL. From what I've heard the cut scenes are not only violence or other graphic stuff but also dialogue and plot development and the like. Bamboo House of Dolls is garbage cinema in its most trashy form and definitely something I wouldn't have liked to see from the Shaw Brothers or Hong Kong in general. Some of the Italian exploitation films of the same subject matter are much more interesting and noteworthy than this quite ridiculous calculated and worthless piece of cinema exploitation. 2/10 
 What kind of a documentary about a musician fails to include a single track by the artist himself?! Unlike Ray or countless other films about music artists half the fun in the theater (or on the couch) is reliving the great songs themselves. Here all the tracks are covers put on by uninteresting characters and these renditions fail to capture Cohen's slow jazzy style. More often the covers are badly sung folk versions. Yuck. The interviews are as much or more with other musicians and figures rather than with Cohen himself. Only rarely does the film feature Cohen reading his own work (never singing)-- like letters poems etc. The movie really didn't capture much about the artist's life story either or about his development through the years. A huge disappointment for a big Cohen fan. 
 This has to be the most brutally unfunny comedy I've ever seen in my life. Ben Stiller Jack Black and Christopher Walken as a crazed homeless man CAN'T make me laugh? Something's got to be wrong with this picture. This is the only movie I've ever felt like walking out of. I used free passes and still felt like I wanted my money back. I can wholeheartedly say that the only movie I've ever seen worse than this one was HOUSE OF THE DEAD. The. ONLY. worse. movie. I laughed very slightly at the merry-go-round scene and that's it. Spending 2 hours in something billed as a comedy should get you more than one laugh right? I don't know I guess the filmmakers thought that flan was a funny word or something. And the other running joke really is beating a dead horse--literally. 
 I'm all for the idea of a grand epic of the American Revolutionary War. This ain't it. (And for that matter neither was the Emmerich/Devlin/Gibson THE PATRIOT. But I digress.) I saw this film at a publicity screening at the old MGM Studios (now Sony) just before it came out. The audience had high expectations for this expensive period piece written by veteran Robert Dillon directed by the esteemed Hugh Hudson (of CHARIOTS OF FIRE fame) and starring Al Pacino. But it didn't take long for people to start squirming in their seats whispering derisive comments about Pacino's horribly misconceived accent -- he was supposed to be an American frontiersman of Scottish ancestry(!) -- and that of Nastassja Kinski who was supposed to be recently emigrated from England(!!). Then the story started and it all went downhill fast. Motivations were muddled dialogue was atrocious events had no historical or political context. What there was of a plot lurched forward on absurd coincidence; by the second or third time that alleged lovers Pacino and Kinski stumbled into each other it had become a bad joke. Donald Sutherland gave an unhinged performance as a British officer/pederast. His accent was all over the map too. I guess there weren't any English actors available. Lots of people left. Those who stayed tried to stifle giggles then openly guffawed. I stuck it out -- I figured that at least the battle scenes might be good. I was wrong. Inexplicably Hudson chose to film them with hand-held cameras not even Steadicam the jerkiness giving a misplaced newsreel 'authenticity' which ruined the sense of scale. There was a semi-famous TV reviewer in the audience a few rows ahead of me: (the late) Gary Franklin of Channel 7 Eyewitness News. I could tell he was peeved by the behavior of the rest of us. And sure enough on his TV segment the next day he gave the film a '10' on his notorious 'Franklin Scale of 1 to 10' while remarking churlishly about the louts who'd disrupted the screening the night before who clearly didn't know art when they saw it. What a buffoon. After this disaster Pacino didn't star in another film for almost 4 years. Hugh Hudson's career never recovered. You can't say I didn't warn you. 
 I've been using IMDb for a few years now but have never written any reviews before. However this movie so disappointed me (even with a modest score of 6.4 at the time of writing) that I couldn't keep quiet anymore. Noise is the story of a New Yorker (Tim Robbins)who is so perturbed by noise pollution that he takes on an alter-ego as a as a vigilante The Rectifier and vandalizes any cars he finds with a car-alarm sounding. I take the name of the movie to be somewhat of a misnomer. Although there are one or two instances of other sources of noise being addressed or mentioned the only true focus of our protagonist is car alarms. Car alarms car alarms car alarms. There is really no other focus. When the movie tries to tie other examples of noise pollution to the problem of car alarms it seems to be just thrown in to give merit to the actions of Robbins' character. Yes we're all annoyed by noise. Nobody likes the sound of car alarms. Of course we all have that internal urge to take a baseball bat to a shrieking vehicle and this movie uses that fact and pretty much that fact alone to sell this movie. I say 'pretty much' because there is also a blatantly contrived sexual relationship (including a completely needless threesome) which is obviously thrown in for those movie-goers who need such things thrown in in order to enjoy a movie. Honestly it's eye-rolling. Robbin's character very shortly into the movie becomes completely unrelatable. It seems less that he decides not to put up with the noise anymore and more that by focusing so much on the noise he has begun to lose his sanity. The first half of the movie is essentially the story of how he turns from just an angry car-bashing dude into this hero of the little guy The Rectifier. However... the transformation doesn't take place. He just renames himself. I could go on for a while. Annoying generalized social commentary comes in every now and then to add to the pretentiousness of the movie and the self-satisfied smirk which never quite leaves Robbins face doesn't help either. Overall I think it's very obvious what this movie is trying to be as it's pretty much shoved down your throat but in my opinion it fails in a big way. Just one guy's opinion cheers. 
 Great western I hear you all say! Brilliant first effort! Well I'm not sure what film you all watched but it must have been a different one to the one I saw. Great westerns or indeed good films of any genre have characters you can believe in and this film had none! The acting was poor to say the least and I couldn't care less about any of the characters making the whole film pointless. the story was too big for the makers and perhaps they should try their hand at making straight to TV low budget rubbish like you see on those FACT OR FICTION programmes on sci-fi. Please if you are looking for a good film a great western or even just an enjoyable hour and a half please look elsewhere. 
 In fact these young people were so distasteful that I couldn't wait for all of 'em to get slaughtered and that includes Clarissa (Joanna Canton) since I considered her the most annoying of the bunch. But I knew it was gonna be a mess from the opening minutes when a teen Christine opened fired on the priest and the nuns with the Leslie Gore music playing in the background. It had nowhere to go but down. Even the prosthetics looked fake and the blood looked suspiciously like Hawaiian Punch although later on it took on red day-glo look to match the silly halloween makeup they were all wearing. I'm sure all the GOTH morons out there will appreciate this bullsh-t since it'll appeal to that bunch. It sure didn't appeal to me. Blah... And not even my favorite horror babe Adrienne Barbeau can save this stupid teen horror flick from itself. She still looks hot though. I'm glad she takes care of herself since we don't get to see too much of her nowadays. However it is a step up from Dante Tomaselli's meandering HORROR (2002) in that it has a somewhat coherent plot so I'll give it that much. That and the little Boston terrier named Boozer also brings it up a notch. I like what Boozer does to Clarissa in the end. It was the only good scene in an otherwise silly film. Lion's Gate Films sure must have been desperate when they picked this one up. 2 out of 10 
 i rate this movie with 3 skulls only coz the girls knew how to scream this could've been a better movie if actors were better the twins were OK i believed they were evil but the eldest and youngest brother they sucked really bad it seemed like they were reading the scripts instead of acting them.... spoiler: if they're vampire's why do they freeze the blood? vampires can't drink frozen blood the sister in the movie says let's drink her while she is alive....but then when they're moving to another house they take on a cooler they're frozen blood. end of spoiler it was a huge waste of time and that made me mad coz i read all the reviews of how this movie was great how many awards this movie won and this movie was f****ing s**t!!!! 
 *Warning - no plot spoilers ahead but movie spoilers nonetheless...* My significant other rented this for me thinking it would be a terrific romance with an all-star cast. Wow - very very wrong. This movie is an overdone overwrought and overly sentimental excuse to theatrically release a student film 15 years after it was shot! The copyright date on the box said 2005 yet during the very first flashback sequence I was looking at the clothes and hairdos that were supposed to be the early 1960s and noticed that the girls especially were wearing late 80s/early 90s dresses and hairdos. It looked as if it had been shot a good 15 or 20 years before the rest of the film! I tried to convenience myself that it was a flashback and therefore supposed to look old but it looked WWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYY more 80s than 60s or even 21st century trying to be 60s... then an adult coworker of the lead character turns up and he looks just like the boy featured in the flashback sequences (yet it's a different much older character whose youth is featured in the flashbacks). I was completely confused until I saw in the special features the short film included - it was all the flashback sequences shot in 1990 as a complete student film of the same title as this movie! It also features commentary that includes the little boy all grown up (and indeed acting the co-worker in the 2005 scenes). Thus this movie is just a shell of story woven around an old re-cut student film put together as an obvious excuse to get it up to theatrical running time. The shell story shot in 2005 is mostly about a man who has lost his wife and finds healing and redemption at the dance class that he promises a dying man he will attend in his stead (something about a promise made by the dying man in the early 60's to his girl that they would meet on the fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the new millennium - an excuse to shoot the segments around the old film in 2005?) These new scenes and plot might have been OK except the awful overly sentimental score that repeats ad nauseum over almost every single new scene and the clichd action that permeates the new movie. Don't bother. There's a reason why you've never heard of this movie even though it has a well-known cast - it's terrible. 
 It could have been a morbidly fascinating look at the life of one of America's most notorious serial killers but sadly it doesn't even come close. Terrible editing direction bad acting you name it. This movie is literally about 10 minutes of plot stretched into 100. The only redeeming quality is Bruce Davidson as the father but that's not nearly enough to save this stinker. A 1 out of 10. 
 Steven Seagal appears to be sleepwalking through a dreadful movie shot almost entirely in close-up to disguise the complete lack of budget and resources. To pick on the technical flaws - silver F/A-18s and F-14s take of from a carrier for an air-strike and miraculously become camouflaged F-16s for the actual strike - would give this movie more credibility than it deserves. Suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the movie is the credit titles which fade on and then disappear in a lightning wipe which presumably is available to all users of Final Cut Pro. Putting all your creativity into your own credit puts Michael Keusch in the same category as Marcel Mandu. 
 The only redeeming qualities this movie has are the fairly original death scenes. Other than that this movie is a big DUD. We have Kim Basinger the beleaguered housewife slowly meandering thru the local mall for the first 30 min. of the movie which added nothing. Then the movie picks up a bit as she has a confrontation with 4 punks who took up 2 parking spaces on this busy xmas eve. They begin to chase her after offing the local security guard who tried to help her. From there this movie gets worse way worse. I know its only a movie and you've gotta go with the flow but she's got about a 5 min. headstart and she can't hide or find someone to help her. Instead she drives to a half built subdivision beside a forest. In typical fashion she does everything she can to allow her followers to easily track her. But now she turns into one tough mofu. You get the point. Do not under any circumstances buy or rent this movie no matter how much you like this type. It's so illogical you'll be questioning every scene. It is embarrassing for Basinger and Craig Sheffer and the rest of the cast as well as the consumers. 
 The John Goodman program was pretty awful but this thing just plain stinks. The one and only thing in this mess that made me smile was recognizing the voice of Patrick Starfish as Frosty. The story is hopeless written by somebody who has garbled memories of childhood rebelliousness but has never gained any adult sense of perspective in the intervening years. Paranoia rules the dark world that these characters inhabit. Everybody is unpleasant and for no reason. The plot is predictable but the show lurches from one inexplicable unconnected scene to another in such a pointless way there is no fun in watching it. The worst thing is nobody in the production crew seems to have ever seen snow! 
 This movie goes beyond just being bad it is definitively the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Unless you yourself have a problem with necrophilia than you will not enjoy will not enjoy the scenes depicting it in this film (if you can call it that). 
 I didn't feel as if I'd been raped like I did with THE ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS but BELLE'S MAGICAL WORLD is still the antithesis of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. Like CHRISTMAS BMW hates its audience although not to such an extreme degree. It's ugly uncanonical idiotic and the writing is horrifically bad.None of the stories work. These are not the characters we loved from BATB at all they're a bunch of pod people. I wanted to dissect it but after a few minutes I gave up because no one in their right mind would take this claptrap seriously. What we have here are three stories. The Perfect Word is an overbearing ponderous study of forgiveness. Fifi's Folly only works if you can accept that Babette's name is actually Fifi and that she's a closet James Bond villainess and that Lumiere is an idiot concerning women. Broken Wing (or Broken Wind as I like to call it) is probably the most heinous of the bunch. Beast hates birds? Since WHEN? Don't watch this crap- every copy of this video deserves to be cremated. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is still a cinematic classic a transcendent celebration of love art intelligence and the human soul. 
 By the numbers story of the Kid (Prince) a singer on his way to becoming a star. Then he falls in love with Apollonia (Appolonia Kotero). But he has to deal with his wife-beating father (Clarence Williams III!) and his own self-destructive behavior. I saw this in a theatre in 1984. I was no big fan of Prince but I did like the three big songs from this movie-- Purple Rain Let's Get Crazy and When Doves Cry . The concert scenes in this movie are great--full of energy and excitement. Unfortunately that's a VERY small portion of the movie. The story is screamingly obvious and have been done many times before--and much better too. The subplots are to put in nicely badly handled. The love triangle between The Kid Appolonia and Morris Day was so predictable and tired that I actually became insulted. His wife beating father is needed for the story but the scenes are so badly handled (in acting and direction) that I couldn't believe it. The script is terrible--lousy dialogue and some truly painful comedy routines. And there's tons of misogyny here--The Kid's mother getting beaten; The Kid hitting Appolonia and (for no reason) Appolonia strips and goes topless to swim in a dirty river. Also Williams' and Princes' characters treat women in a horrible manner constantly. The acting is where this movie REALLY fails. Appolonia is sweet and beautiful--but no actor. And Prince is (easily) the WORST actor I've ever seen. His blank face and wooden dialogue delivery are so bad I couldn't believe it. This movie only comes to life during the concert scenes but there aren't really that many. The dramatic scenes are so badly acted and handled that they make this movie a chore to sit through. They should have just made this a concert film. I give this a 2--only for the music. 
 A model named Laura is working in South America when she is kidnapped from her hotel room by a gang and taken into the jungle. They demand a huge ransom for her release. Peter is hired to get her home safe and there is a bonus in it for him if he can bring back the money as well as the girl. Peter is taken to the jungle by helicopter with friend Jack. They try to give the kidnappers fake money in return for Laura but the plan goes horribly wrong and they have to bail out in the helicopter. The helicopter is shot and they also have to bail from that (not going well so far). Also roaming the jungles is a devil of sorts. In reality its just a naked black guy with weirdly big eyes and a breathing problem. He starts to kill a few of the kidnappers and Laura escapes only to be captured by some primitives. The rest of the film is a bit of a blur really. Now I'm not a massive Jess Franco fan in fact to date this is only the second film of his I have seen but even I can tell that this really isn't one of his best efforts. The films drags along at a pretty slow pace without much at all happening. The whole thing could have been edited down quite easily into a 25 minute TV show. There are plenty of overly long shots of people walking through the jungle that could have just been lifted straight out. Devil Hunter is poorly lit (Infact I don't think it was lit at all) badly dubbed poorly acted and slow yet for some reason it didn't bore me. I think the main reason for this was some of the hilariously bad scenes in it. For example a scene where Laura is walking in the street was obviously shot in a real street as crowds of people stop to stare straight at the camera as its shooting. Another funny scene has one of the gang who has been killed hung in a tree dripping blood as one of his friends stands directly under him screaming for what seems like minutes. Then for no reason at all the man in the trees head just falls of and hits the guy under him. It has to be seen to be believed. Then of course there is the actual devil. It is just some naked black guy who despite the fact he has massive eyes he has very blurry vision. The film was hooked up in part of the video nasty scare in the 80's here in the UK and was banned. Now why it was I have no idea. There is very little gore at all and it's hardly a shocking film. Minus the nudity I would have said that it could get away with a PG almost. The only thing I can think of is that it was never actually watched and was added to the original list because of word of mouth. There is not much reason to watch this film really unless you are a massive Jess Franco fan. There is plenty of nudity to keep you from falling asleep and also some scenes that are so bad you can have a good laugh at them but other wise I would say just pay for a ticket to South America and get lost in a jungle. It would probably be more fun. 3/10 
 Mere thoughts of Going Overboard (aka Babes Ahoy ) make me want to weep. Throwing yourself out a window would be better than watching this movie. It's not even a supposed so bad it's good movie. I would spend money to buy copies of this movie and burn them so that people can't see it. Oh the pain the pain... 
 What a piece of stupid tripe. I won't even waste time evaluating any of the points of this show. It's not worth the time. The one comment I will make is - why get such a DUMB inarticulate doofus to be the star?!? There aren't many more dismal testimonials to the deteriorating mental condition of the networks than the fact that FOX has stated it will NOT bring back John Doe (a decent series) but WILL bring back brain-dead drivel like Joe Millionaire for yet another round of killing the brain cells of the american public. FOX has lost it IMHO. 
 To be honest I didn't like Executive Decision - which was obvious the template - very much but compared to this piece of crap it looks like a masterpiece of art. Not only that the people moving in the film (the term actors would be an insult for all other actors) should attend more acting classes the guy who build the setting hasn't even seen an aircraft from afar. It is so ridiculous that on a 747 only 3 flight attendance are aboard but this is only the tip of the iceberg. The film is full of illogicalness (e.g.: use sleeping-gas then don't use it then use it anyway) which dropped my rating finally to the bottom. You can have more fun in rearranging you sock drawer or in drilling a hole in your knee and fill it with milk. 
 I question its importance to Queer Cinema as it seems to be more about having a homosexual encounter via violent behavior than making any clear statements regarding homosexuality and violence. Three tales are tangled together in a rather sloppy manner. I found myself trying to untangle the messy narrative in the first 15 minutes that alone didn't sit well with me. Weak plot points were endlessly repeated as though we might not have gotten it the first 10 times. There was a feeling of padded dialog throughout the film. More like a 45 minute Boy's Brief short rather than a fleshed out full-length film. It had a certain erotic flair male nudity and sex appeal but overall the sum did not equal its parts. The 1st part: Boxer/Stalker storyline was the strongest and yet it too felt like it had been pulled thin. Bob has been following Tim for four years and only now is he confronting him? I felt as though their cat-mouse game was not developed enough to merit its conclusion. We needed more information about them and less Parking Lot/Locker scenes with Tim relentlessly saying What do you want? The 2nd part: Danny wants his buddy Tony to beat him up while he jacks-off. Tony doesn't seem to mind but he doesn't even appear interested in exploring the implications of his homo erotic hobby -- not even after they do it in the nude. This tale lacks the all-important transition from I'm a straight boy smacking my guy friend around for fun to I think I might be gay and hitting him because I'd like to spread his ass and do him S/M style. A very important thing to leave out. Clearly these stories each could have conveyed their points in half the time. The 3rd part with the man and woman slapping each other around adds to that thought. Furthermore it was unnecessary and added nothing to the film. Yes the actors did a fine job under the circumstances and the four male leads were very sexy. The make-up (bruises and cuts) however was on par with a grammar school talent show. There wasn't enough meat to this story to have any impact on the gay politic. The film made no statement squandered time and is not engaging or worthy enough for thoughtful investment. Its fatal flaw is its amateurish approach that makes it ultimately impossible to take seriously. 
 Though a bit more polished technically than the previous film in the series BULLDOG DRUMMOND ESCAPES this is a weaker escapade in both a plot that's less thrilling and a leading man who simply doesn't have the charisma of Ray Milland. That said several actors and characters continue in their roles and manage to keep the flag flying. Also John Barrymore is present popping up all through the film in a variety of outlandish disguises. Anyway it's another endless night for BD as he and his cohorts chase around trying to rescue the poor girl he intends to marry. The clues are stupid but again the supporting actors often make them entertaining. 
 Worst mistake of my life. I picked this movie up at Target for $5 because I figured Hey it's Sandler I can get some cheap laughs . I was wrong completely wrong. Mid-way through the film all three of my friends were asleep and I was still suffering. Worst plot Worst script Worst movie I have ever seen. I wanted to hit my head up against a wall for an hour then I'd stop and you know why? Because it felt damn good. Upon bashing my head in i stuck that damn movie in the microwave and watched it burn....and that felt better than anything else I've ever done. It took American Psycho Army of Darkness and Kill Bill just to get over that crap. I HATE YOU SANDLER FOR ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH WITH THIS AND RUINING A WHOLE DAY OF MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 ......in a horror movie that is. Alright first off lets start with Kate. Her main goals include getting laid by George Clooney looking good and last but not least screwing everyone over. Gotta love her. She had about 3 amazingly good chances to finish off this sicko but ..... instead she ran. I mean she didn't wanna bring Guy out for 10 minutes and when she did it was too late. I mean the guy tried to rape her. I cant get into these movies where the main character is a sad idiot. I mean who honestly would have any sympathy for a guy who finishes off everyone she has meet in a night. The movie kept going on. And as a result lost all its credibility. 
 I am really surprised that this movie get a ranking like this! I haven't seen such a bad movie for years.Omg this was a really bad movie. Splatter is not enough to describe the unnecessary (nearly funny) blood scenes). If you didn't like hostel2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween (2007) ..well this is 10 time worse. The story remind me RL Stine goosebumps.! I can't tell about the acting since the script was so terrible.Clich all the time. (why i must write 10lines? i never understood this.) ==Here comes spoilers== The story is about a butcher killing people all the time in metro. We are talking about thousands of killings and no one gets notice. Actually those people are just missing. And There is the good guy that tries to solve the mystery (well there is no mystery for us because we know from the beginning the bad guy) and as usual no one believes him! what a surprise! In the end he puts butcher clothes and fights to death with the killer butcher! 
 I can see the guys doing the budget preparation for this flick. Well lets see now we spend 50% getting Dirk Benidict cause Battle Star Galactic and the A-Team were cool. The we spend 40% making a Demon Costume never mind that the Demon is supposed to be incorporeal in the script. And we spend the rest making the movie. This was pretty bad and VERY cliche.... Have a loved one present when watching (or bring a good book) 
 I am a big fan of low budget horror movies like this but come on! This has to be the worst piece of monkey S@#t I have ever seen! I ignored the reviews posted on this site figuring that it would fall into my taste in horror but I got bored and turned it off.Let's see: The wardrobe: Consisted of cheap cameo outfits and painters outfits from home depot. The masks were made from what looks like tin foil. The Gore: The Gore was pretty good I must give it that. But Ittenbach's Burning moon was better for a low budget movie. Acting: Was horrible! I didn't mind the dubbing. I find this humorous like in Ittenbach's Premutos (great movie). The fighting and action sequences were pi$$ poor. Bottom line: Don't watch any of Schnaas's movies. There are much better directors like Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach with movies of the same gore and subject matter. Check Premutos House of blood Schramm and the nekromantiks. 
 Yeah unfortunately I came across the DVD of this and found that it was incredibly awful. First of all the characters suck. I mean come on if some dork in an orange hat who calls himself 'Orange Sherbert' is the best creative idea these guys could come up for a character then they should definitely not be in the film-making scene. Poor costumes bad interviews and basically there is not one wrestler on this whole disc with any shred of charisma. The wrestling in Splatter Rampage Wrestling is nothing more than these idiots gently and playfully bouncing together on a trampoline. They make sure to giggle together all the while too making the experience seem more like a toddler's playtime than a wrestling deathmatch . Basically Splatter Rampage Wrestling is a pretty lackluster Backyard Wrestling clone. Only instead of blood weapons mayhem and WRESTLING we get a trampoline giggling kids TERRIBLE audio and some guy called Orange Sherbert. Wrestling fan or not avoid this DVD. It's awful. 
 What can I say? I think I have to write Spoiler alert and then reveal they used the F-word a LOT in this movie - like in every two sentences. I did not like this movie at all - too much hints on sexual perversions sidesteps and cheating. And that swearing was totally out the window. I gave this movie 3 and two of those points are for Mira Sorvino's sexy movements on the dance floor. 
 I guess it's Jack's great empathic ability that makes him the powerful performer that he is but empathy comes at a price like all things-when he's surrounded by mediocrity he instinctively lowers the standard and becomes one with it. He is a joke as a mafia-hit-man(also because the part doesn't suit him one bit him being so extroverted)and just grazing avoids making a fool of himself in this.Kathleen Turner had a much tooooo long career just by being tall and blonde because her acting ability is limited to that thing she does with her eyes when she opens them wide which she's convinced is sooooo damn sexy and Anjelica Huston is the absolute same(granted interesting) in everything just like Robert Loggia. The movie is a lame draft(and this will be the only mention of the rag they call script) of a gangster-movie with a cast that was probably only interested to get to the after-party faster(they certainly gathered the party-going elite in this). What did they shoot it in 1 day?-cause that would be the only explanation. 
 This movie is written by Charlie Higson who has before this done the legendary Fast Show and his own show based on one of Fast Show's characters (Tony the car sales man). He's also written James Bond books for kids. Actually I've seen before this only Gordon's movies that are based on Lovecraft's stories and every one of those is marvelous. Here Gordon tries to do something different. The style is totally contemporary which means shaky camera fast and strange cutting cool chillout music in the background. It works quite well here I guess but it's still pointless and cheap. It makes me often think of the cameraman who's shaking his dv-camera in front of the actors/actresses and try to make stylish moves in the pictures (hoping that something tolerable would come out of it). The casting is good and there is a whole atmosphere which is the result of good directing. I think the main character the zero young guy is quite interesting in his zeroness . The fat guy is also good. And the guy who looks like Alec Baldwin but is not him. But pretty soon after the beginning the movie turns out to be something not-so-interesting: In this case I mean an endless line of scenes of sadism and sickness. There is not much humanity in this film/story: It's totally pessimistic and every person in this movie is disgusting and hopeless or soon dead. Needless to say that there is no humor either. It's a 1'40 long vomit without no relief in any moment. Anyway Gordon remains to me one of the most interesting movie makers that are active today and I think of this movie as an experiment and as a failure in that. Everyone has to experience getting lost sometimes just to learn and to find their way again. This might be Gordon's most uninteresting and empty work. 
 This can't be Mandy Schaffer's last film. Somebody do something! :-( Argh. What little life this one might have had the directing finished off. Don't blame the cast; they did OK. Even the winemaker's younger brother was pretty well done and he didn't even get into the movie until halfway through. And please please put Mandy in some more movies! She's too beautiful to bury her career at such a young age. Ya' breakin' my haht heah.... Two specific criticisms in case anyone cares (apparently nobody liked this movie very much). First the way Traci kept popping up at just the right melodramatic moment in order to see whatever she was supposed to see and never got seen in return was very annoying. Hollywood: please stop giving villains perfect timing luck which runs out exactly when the climax arrives. It's dumb. Write better scripts so you won't have to use that lame plot device any more. If your script isn't good enough to stand up without that then don't produce it. Second Carmen wouldn't have fallen for that fake injury trick that Traci pulled. She already had Traci fingered. More bad writing/directing there. I could trash this movie further but mercy forbids it. Actually I didn't hate it as much as the others seem to have. It just didn't have much of a reason for being made unless it was purely a vehicle to show off the lovely Mandy. Oh and to whoever didn't think she was sexy... the character wasn't very well written but how can you say she wasn't sexy?!? One or the other of us needs glasses and I don't think it's me. MORE MANDY. (Not to be confused with Moore Mandy -- although I'd like to see her again too. ;-) P.S. Did I mention I hope Mandy makes me more movies? <:-D 
 I'm allowed to write 1000 words about this film but one word could suffice: bizarre. Hubby and I didn't laugh so much as gawk at this truly dreadful movie. We kept looking at each other with our best What the...? expressions. There is no way to adequately describe this movie. Killer tomatoes were funny but this is just sick. What kind of mind produces images like these and then puts them on film for others to see? What kind of mind includes innocent children in this weird weird movie and then packages it as if it is appropriate for children? Parents whatever you do if your child still believes in Santa don't let him/her see this movie. Preteens can watch it -- probably with What the...? expressions on their faces. If you decide to inflict this movie on others you might want to spike their eggnog. Quite possibly the worst film ever made. 
 If derivative and predictable rape-revenge thrillers are your thing then you're in for a rare treat... They don't really appeal to me so I couldn't find any single thing to redeem this peculiar tale. It seems like something straight out of the 1980s a different age when this would have gone straight to video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer do OK work with a weak script and a tedious scenario. But what is Gillian Anderson doing getting involved with a film like this after the brilliance of her performance as Lady Deadlock in the BBC TV adaptation of Bleak House last year? The director is said to have been influenced by witnessing a near-rape and by his work on documentaries but even that's not an excuse for the bizarre scene where a pack of rural hounds beat up Dyer. I don't think I was the only person in the cinema laughing. What I can't understand is the involvement of the companies behind this film - FilmFour and Verve Pictures. Both have been involved in some great independent British films in recent years. Verve distributed Bullet Boy Code 46 and Red Road - Straightheads doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. FilmFour and Verve take note: is this really the best you can do? What are independent British filmmakers going to make of your artistic judgement? It's a big blot on both of your reputations. Listen carefully: can you hear the thousands of fans of independent British films crying in despair? 
 It is hard to describe this film and one wants to tried hard not to dismiss it too quickly because you have a feeling that this might just be the perfect film for some 12 years old girl... This film has a nice concept-the modern version of Sleeping Beauty with a twist. It has some rather dreamy shots and some nice sketches of the young boy relationship with his single working mother and his schoolmate... a nice start you might say but then it got a bit greedy very greedy it tries to be a science fiction a drama a thriller a possible romantic love story fairy tale a comedy and everything under the sun. The result just left the audience feeling rather inadequate. For example the scene when the girl(played by Risa Goto) finally woken by his(Yuki Kohara) kiss instead of being romantic it try's to be scary in order to make us laugh afterwards... it is a cheap trick because it ruin all the anticipation and emotion which it was trying to build for the better half of the film. I have not read the original story the film is base on (it is the well-known work by the comic-book artist Osamu Tezuka is famous with his intriguing and intricate stories) I wonder if all the problems exsist in the original story or did it occur in the adaption? It is rather illogical even for someone who is used to the fussy logic of those japanese comic-book. For instance how did Yuki Kohara's character manage to get to the hospital in an instant(when its suppose to be a long bus-ride away)to run away Risa Goto's character in front of the tv cameras right after he saw her live interview on the television? There are also some scenes that is directly copied(very uncreative!) from other films and they all seem rather pointlessly annoying ie. the famous the Lion mouth has caugh my hand scene from the Roman Holiday The film tries to be everything but ends up being nothing... it fails to be a fairy tale and it did not have enough jokes to be a comedy... and strangely there are some scenes that even seem like an unintentional ghost movie. Nevertheless one should give it credit that it has managed to caputured some of the sentiment of the japanese teenager. It is by watching this film I have a feeling that there might be some films that should have come with a warning label that said this film might only be suitable for person under the 18 of age it would have definitly been on the poster of this film. 
 Ugh! Where to begin ... first Campbell Scott's non-stop angst becomes a real turn-off after awhile (a very short while) as he internalizes his mounting anguish curiosity and anger. Only we don't care! These characters as presented by the writer and director are wholly unlikable and therein lies the key. They haven't given us anything to make us care if they are adulterous and whether or not they are still in love with one another. When Scott quietly tells his wife I could kill you before their three daughters at the dinner table after the shock of his selfishly poor timing wore off I almost wished that he had--and then done the same thing to the smug wisecracking apparition of Denis Leary before being hauled off the the looney bin. An utter waste of time and perhaps--only perhaps--resources. 
 I remember when this piece of trash came out all the newspapers were squawking about how it had taken Barbra Streisand years to get the film made. Well it couldn't have taken that many years; the play only opened in 1975 eight years previously. It made a Broadway star of the great actress Tovah Feldshuh who probably should have been cast in the film but NOOOOO...the Great STAR BARBRA HAD TO DO IT HER WAY. AND WITH MUSIC NO LESS! This film is a total disaster from start to finish. For one thing Barbra was FORTY YEARS OLD when she made it and she looked every minute of it. There was no way anyone could possibly swallow her as a young girl yearning to study Torah. And then when she dresses up as a boy it gets campy. I get the impression that Streisand could not bear to be unattractive so she played around with the make-up; she is prettier as a boy than she is as a girl. And as if that is not bad enough she gets involved with both her schoolmate Avigdor (Mandy Patinkin whose best moment is the shot of his naked rear end) AND his fiance (Amy Irving who does her usual sleepwalker routine a bit of schtick the poor woman always resorts to when the director ignores her and she does not know what she is doing). Yentl even goes so far as to marry the girl; I won't even bother to mention the wedding night scene. Then there is the music. Nine totally forgettable songs all sung by Streisand via voice-over (presumably as a look inside her mind) and each one as intrusive and irritating as fingernails on a blackboard. I won't say that Streisand does not show a glimmer of promise as a director here; some of the visuals are lovely (Patinkin's backside especially) and she has a good eye for balance. The problem with this movie is that she won't get out of her own way. I did not believe her for one second in the title role; she should NEVER have added the songs and on top of that the whole mess goes on for two hours and fifteen minutes. I was sick of the whole sorry mess after forty-five minutes. Awful awful awful. 
 For the life of me I cannot get why they would want to make a movie about the Jerry Springer Show . It's so incrediably trashy. Some ways sadly it's a guilty pleasure. We all have to admit that we've seen at least one episode. It's part of our pop culture. I saw this on USA recently. It's pretty bad. I will admit that. Jerry does a horrible job of what I think he meant as acting. Or something like it. Jamie Pressley is in it. She's playing herself basically. All she needed was her lover boy Kid Rock. It would've been perfect then. So I would recommend skipping Ringmaster . Just watch the Jerry Springer Show . It's more enjoyable than this. 2/10 
 Bela Lugosi revels in his role as European horticulturalist (sic) Dr. Lorenz in this outlandish tale of horror and dementia. The good doctor's aging wife needs fluids harvested from the glands of young virgins in order to retain her youth and beauty. What better place for the doctor to maintain his supply than at the alter where he kidnaps the unsuspecting brides before they can complete their vows? Sedating them into a coma-like state he brings them to his mansion to collect his tainted bounty according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis. That brief description is much more entertaining and imaginative than the movie. ** The Corpse Vanishes (1942) Wallace Fox ~ Bela Lugosi Luana Walters Elizabeth Russell 
 Shecky is a god damned legend make no mistake. Until recently I worked for a UK HiFi & Video retail chain running their testing department. We would go through many new starters they would be expected to to learn how to fault find the various detritus that returns as non functional in one way or another from the stores. Now to tortu^^^^^ test the resolve of these new staff members we would issue them with a copy of Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of Goodmans DVD player that had this film as a free gift got round to sending their DVD player back they never failed to send Shecky back also. Our new staff would be forced to use only Going Overboard to test these machines for faults until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with. Now as to why this film is so bad where do I begin? Adam Sandler who can be so so very funny as in Happy Gilmore or the Wedding Singer must have been having one hell of an off day. The rest of the crew stank and what is it with Billy Zane? His name crops up in several of the worst movies of all time and he is a decent actor. Crazy. The production quality is absolute zero. I would have been inclined to give this a zero if I could because they didn't even have the guts to call it by it's full name 'The Unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz' on release. Even so it is worth a watch so you can see just how far Sandler has come and just how low he can go. 
 I sat through this movie this evening forcing myself to stick with it even though I never cared about any of the characters or what happened to them because the two leads Grard Philippe and Michle Morgan were major film stars of their era and I wanted to see them in something different which this certainly was. They both gave fine performances but of distasteful characters. Indeed the whole movie is about a shabby little town in Mexico inhabited by almost uniformly distasteful characters (the doctor is of course the major exception). What Michle Morgan ever sees in Philippe to fall in love with him is never explained. This is supposedly based on a work by Jean-Paul Sartre. All I could think was that if Sartre's work is anything like this movie it must be a very mediocre attempt at imitating Camus' masterful novel The Plague which dealt with a plague in North Africa. A well-acted but uninteresting movie. 
 It is difficult to find any positives in this movie. Seems as though the producer needed to make a buck without much effort & hence we are treated to a full showing of Galaxy which is the lamest excuse for a movie in history. The police girls looked extremely sexy in their little uniforms. More action shots of the two cops & a lot less of Galaxy would have been the way to go. Of course that would add to the budget so they decided to fill the space with that wretched rerun. Ms Albright does excellent looking sexy & her acting is first rate. Ms Stabs whom I had heard of but not seen on screen before also looked very desirable but seems to lack basic acting talent. Apart from Ms Albright this is real garbage. 
 This movie was a real torture fest to sit through. Its first mistake is treating nuclear power as so self-evidently a 'bad thing' that it barely needs to convince the audience of it. When it does stoop to putting in its argument it has the participants breathlessly deliver barely substantiated facts ; all that's missing is someone crying when is someone going to think of the children! . While watching this movie I kept thinking where'd you hear that? or that can't possibly be true - yet little of the info was backed up by any reliable sources. And bless 'em the 'regular folks' in the movie came across more like Luddites than people with any understanding of the pros and cons of nuclear power; to be fair that might be the fault of the film-makers but equally fairly it's a condition shared by the movie's rock stars. As for the performers........... Now some of these people are highly respected musicians whose music I've enjoyed and I'm sure a few of them really did believe in this cause. But they all come across as wheezing old hippies desperately searching for something to get worked up over now that the 60s have passed them by. Particularly embarrassing are Graham Nash and James Taylor. Nash seems to be trying too hard - he looks like he can't possibly believe the things he's being told (not that I blame him) but desperate to feel noticed and included. James Taylor performs what has to be the wimpiest protest anthem ever Stand and Fight in the most sickeningly cheerful way you can imagine. In fact most of the performances are pretty bland when they're not being patronizing. Nobody seems worked up by this event as if it really doesn't mean much to them at all. It's worth noting that the driving force behind this whole event seems to be John Hall of the band Orleans and responsible for some of the wimpiest MOR pop of the 70s. (Remember if you dare Dance With Me and Still the One .) It's worth noting because that's symbolic of how the cause here fails to inspire any real passion in the music. The cause is supposedly life-or-death but everybody sleepwalks through their numbers like they're playing the Catskills. Except maybe Gil-Scott Heron - his protest number We Almost Lost Detroit is on topic at least but delivered with all the smugness of a high-schooler impressed with how 'controversial' he's being. Only Bruce Springsteen's performance raises a pulse; I've never been a big fan of the Boss but he absolutely smokes no question. Part of me thinks he was taped separately at another event and edited into this movie to give wake the audience. Compared to the general blandness and air of self-satisfaction here it's no wonder Bruce was hailed as the savior of rock'n'roll. But even his performance is hobbled by the lifeless concert shooting. I don't expect a lot of flashy camera movement from a '70s film but the shots are unnecessarily static broken up only by split-second cutaways to a back-up singer's tonsils. Now some of this may be because the performers are lifeless to start with; and *maybe* the film-makers are more skilled at shooting documentaries than concert footage - but all you have to do is watch Rust Never Sleeps or The Last Waltz to see a movie like this done with more skill. And with more exciting musicians. So really there's only two things to watch this movie for: Springsteen's stellar performance and as a sad snapshot about a counter-culture in decline. 
 For months preceding the release of this movie you saw it advertised in all sorts of print media so I patiently waited for its video release to see what all the hype was about. After it was over I had to apologize to my roommate for occupying the VCR for the last hour and a half to watch such a horrible movie. It essentially fails because it is a character based movie about unredeemable characters. With the possible exception of Amanda Peet (whose only redeemable quality is that she is Amanda Peet) you cannot stand any of them. The film relies on its dialogue which is sophomoric moronic and crude. The only slightly amusing character is Eric whose portrayal of the sole married member of a group of friends is dead on. The final twist designed to make you laugh at the three main characters only instead inspires the same kind of resentment towards Peet. All in all only rent if you are desperate or possess a dark sense of humor. 
 This movie wasn't just bad - it was terrible. After I watched it I actually felt the need to TAKE A SHOWER to get the filth off of me. There is running 'gag' with an elderly couple making out it is not funny but it is disgusting. The monster make up was cool but that is all. The continuity errors alone will have you angry - at least I was. The editing is really poor. Almost anything else you could possibly do would be better than spending time watching this movie. Even if your group of friends are into 'bad movies' this one is exceptional in its ineptitude I couldn't even bring myself to laugh at it. You have been warned. 
 Well what can i say about this movie. I'm speechless. I could go on about how stupid this movie is forever though the one thing that REALLY pi*sed me off was the music. And to top it all off someone commented on how much they LIKED it. To them all I have to say is that it was ripped off from one of the best martial arts movies of all time Fistsof fury starring Bruce Lee. IF he was still alive and ever came across this movie he'd be horrified. the rest of the movie is absolutely ridiculous and a waste of tape. I say tape because a movie like that couldn't possibly have been shot on film.I now feel more stupid for wasting 30 minutes of my life watching it. The only reason why i even saw it was because my roommate downloaded it out of morbid curiosity. What is this world coming to. 
 From the decrepit ranks of the already over-saturated 'Hillybilly Horror' sub-genre comes this woeful tale of a vacationing family terrorized by inbred rednecks. Sound familiar? Well it most definitely should to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the horror genre. There is absolutely new here. The film seems content to recycle all thee old worn out clichs (deformed hicks a peaceful family turned gun-toting killers when push comes to show the rebellious daughter the one 'freak' who's good at heart etcetera...) but does even that half-heartedly enough to make this an utter waste of time. This is forgettable dreck but humorously enough lead J.D. Hart once starred in a movie called Films that Suck earlier in his career quite an ironic omen indeed. My Grade: D- 
 This sure is one comedy I'm not likely to forget for a while. Wouldn't normally bother to comment on this movie: it's so minor that no one would watch it anyway but as it happens it's kind of popular in p2p sharing networks such as Kazaa and so this saaad production needs to be exposed for what it is. So what is it then? Well of course it's not really a comedy; instead it's intended as a horror flick -- intended very much being the key word here. The script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess the special effects are only special in that they're especially pathetic and as for the acting well let's just say that if this had been my graduating play at primary school my teachers would have burst out crying at our talent. Of course I realise that this is a very low budget film and that in those cases one should lower one's expectations certainly as far as things like special effects are concerned. Also even though I'm a big fan of the horror genre I'm aware that these movies are only rarely the places to look for interesting scripts and top notch acting. But still. B-movies often have some redeeming features to make up for the lack of funding such as humour. The only laughs in Cradle to Fear lie in the ridiculous performances. If you can find the humour in that--and I could for the first 20 minutes or so gradually dozing off after that--then that's going to be the only thing the movie has to offer. Oh that and two or three pairs of breasts. Woohoo how exciting. As for the story it's not even that it doesn't try to convey anything: the victims either use drugs and/or are involved in serious crime. The lesson: Watch out naughty boys and girls because one day you'll be made to pay for what you've done. I rest my case. So all in all a little bit of sex a fair amount of drugs but absolutely zero rock 'n roll. I rate this one 1 out of 10 but would go to 0 if I could. Or perhaps I wouldn't: it deserves a 1 for spelling the actors' names correctly in the titles. I mean that's something innit? 
 Every so often a movie comes along that knocks me down a notch and reminds me that my taste in films I seek out to watch isn't always impeccable. I normally would stay away from stuff like this but I was duped by some glowing reviews and the Rohmer pedigree. There's an initial and intriguing novelty to the production where Rohmer essentially superimposes the actors onto painted (digital) back-drops of revolution era France. This quickly wanes and becomes about as interesting as watching the paint dry on a paint by numbers scene. What we're left with is a boring and stuffy film about aristocrats in 18th century France. None of the characters are appealing or sympathetic. The pace is so languid the dialogue so arduous and suspense is clearly a foreign concept to Rohmer that I ended up not caring whose head rolled who was harboring who or what the devil the revolution was supposed to be about. The movie would've greatly benefited from some semblance of emotional build-up and a music score (there's some fine classical music used at the very end). Despite being so talky the film plays much like a silent film and the worst kind of film at that a dull and uninteresting film about infinitely interesting subjects. Only the most astute French historians will find anything to take from this film as it dose seem to paint well known events from a new angle (the Lady is English and a royalist). Otherwise avoid this yawner at all costs unless you are suffering from insomnia (I dozed off twice). 
 Very poor effort that offers pretty much nothing to anyone but a hardcore fan of Stanley Tucci who tries but can not save the poor structure dialogue direction or talent of our leading man. Pretty much the only trick this plodding tale of a naive new salesman for an alarm company has is its quirky side characters. But without a realistic backdrop such characters are pointless. Nothing to see here keep moving... 
 This film is the worst film I have ever seen. The story line is weak - I couldn't even follow it. The acting is high-schoolish. The sound track is irritating. The attempts at humor are not. The editing is horrible. The credits are even slow - I would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this waste of film. Don't waste your time even thinking about this attempt at acting. 
 I've read all the rave reviews here and am impressed with the imagination of those who loved this film. I can't say that I found much to recommend it. The Leonard Cohen sound track is not only excessively heavy-handed but dreary beyond measure. The film looks authentic enough but something's got to happen for it to work and nothing much does: a cursory plot (not a real problem for me) not much character development nothing thematically. It just slogs along. Flawed as it is Cimino's Heaven's Gate has some moments of genuine wonder and is a film I'd sooner watch again. For a brilliant reconception of the West HBO's Deadwood is much superior to McCabe.  
 This movie is simply far too long far too repetitive with the male nudity and sexuality being (as this is said as a gay with my own collection of adult titles) far too gratuitous and unnecessary. Much of the first third of the movie could have been cut down to ten minutes and been equally as effective without trying the patience (and stamina) of an audience. I saw this movie on an early Saturday afternoon with a film festival audience; the type of crowd that tends to be more adventuresome interested in more experimental or atypical films such as one without much dialog shorts foreign films. The near sell out crowd in an approximate 275 seat theater started to dribble out within the first half of the movie and while the great majority did stay for the pay off (which never actually arrived) I have never in about 14 years of attending any number of film festivals experimental gay and otherwise seen such a large number of people walk away from a film. This movie could easily have been cut down by more than half and been as effective as it was. It also could have gone in different directions still with a shorter running time and been far more effective. As it currently exists this is not something that one can readily recommend or one I would have any desire to watch again. 
 Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors but it would go on for pages. In all I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi Jr. I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me. 
 I saw the trailer to this film and it looked great so I went out and bought it. What a mistake the acting is a shambles the special effects (if you could call them that) look like something that wouldn't be out of place at a school play. Some of the characters are so stupid in this film you will cringe the minute they are on the screen which unfortunately is all to often. As for a story forget it. This is a warning don't waste any money at all on this film it has to be one of the worst things I have ever seen. If for some reason you like this film watch Troll 2 you will probably enjoy that as well. 
 This movie was so terrible it was almost good... almost. We love musicals but not this one. Even with the terrible sound quality poor cinematography and many actors who can't sing or dance Anthony Rapp actually managed to give a good performance (especially toward the end). The character Marjorie a drunk lady was enjoyable to watch too. The plot is very unexpected and could have been funny without terrible singing and cheezy piano music. Admittadly some of the songs (fantabulous) are pretty catchy (but not in a good way). Open House is a funny movie to watch simply because it is awful! We think it might be a good stage musical (with excellent actors). 
 Wimpy stuffed shirt Armand Louque (blandly played by veteran character actor Dean Jagger in a rare lead role) joins a group of researchers who want to find and destroy the secret technique of creating zombies. Armand falls for the lovely Claire Duval (fetching blonde Dorothy Stone) who uses the meek sap to get Armand's colleague Clifford Grayson (the hopelessly wooden Robert Noland) to marry her. Furious over being used and spurned by Claire Armand uses his knowledge of voodoo to get revenge. Sound exciting? Well it sure ain't. For starters Victor Halperin's static (non)direction lets the meandering and uneventful talk-ridden story plod along at an excruciatingly slow pace. Worse yet Halperin crucially fails to bring any tension atmosphere and momentum to the hideously tedious proceedings. The mostly blah acting from a largely insipid cast doesn't help matters any; only George Cleveland as the hearty General Duval and E. Alyn Warren as the irascible Dr. Trevissant manage to enliven things a bit with their welcome and refreshing hammy histrionics. The drippy stock film library score the painfully obvious stagebound sets and the crude cinematography are pretty lousy and unimpressive as well. In fact this feeble excuse for a fright feature is so crummy that not even the uncredited starkly staring eyes of the great Bela Lugosi can alleviate the brain-numbing boredom. A dismally dull dud. 
 Okay you have: Penelope Keith as Miss Herringbone-Tweed B.B.E. (Backbone of England.) She's killed off in the first scene - that's right folks; this show has no backbone! Peter O'Toole as Ol' Colonel Cricket from The First War and now the emblazered Lord of the Manor. Joanna Lumley as the ensweatered Lady of the Manor 20 years younger than the colonel and 20 years past her own prime but still glamourous (Brit spelling not mine) enough to have a toy-boy on the side. It's alright they have Col. Cricket's full knowledge and consent (they guy even comes 'round for Christmas!) Still she's considerate of the colonel enough to have said toy-boy her own age (what a gal!) David McCallum as said toy-boy equally as pointlessly glamourous as his squeeze. Pilcher couldn't come up with any cover for him within the story so she gave him a hush-hush job at the Circus. and finally: Susan Hampshire as Miss Polonia Teacups Venerable Headmistress of the Venerable Girls' Boarding-School serving tea in her office with a dash of deep poignant advice for life in the outside world just before graduation. Her best bit of advice: I've only been to Nancherrow (the local Stately Home of England) once. I thought it was very beautiful but somehow not part of the real world. Well we can't say they didn't warn us. Ah Susan - time was your character would have been running the whole show. They don't write 'em like that any more. Our loss not yours. So - with a cast and setting like this you have the re-makings of Brideshead Revisited right? Wrong! They took these 1-dimensional supporting roles because they paid so well. After all acting is one of the oldest temp-jobs there is (YOU name another!) First warning sign: lots and lots of backlighting. They get around it by shooting outdoors - hey it's just the sunlight! Second warning sign: Leading Lady cries a lot. When not crying her eyes are moist. That's the law of romance novels: Leading Lady is dewy-eyed. Henceforth Leading Lady shall be known as L.L. Third warning sign: L.L. actually has stars in her eyes when she's in love. Still I'll give Emily Mortimer an award just for having to act with that spotlight in her eyes (I wonder . did they use contacts?) And lastly fourth warning sign: no on-screen female character is Mrs. She's either Miss or Lady. When all was said and done I still couldn't tell you who was pursuing whom and why. I couldn't even tell you what was said and done. To sum up: they all live through World War II without anything happening to them at all. OK at the end L.L. finds she's lost her parents to the Japanese prison camps and baby sis comes home catatonic. Meanwhile (there's always a meanwhile ) some young guy L.L. had a crush on (when I don't know) comes home from some wartime tough spot and is found living on the street by Lady of the Manor (must be some street if SHE's going to find him there.) Both war casualties are whisked away to recover at Nancherrow (SOMEBODY has to be whisked away SOMEWHERE in these romance stories!) Great drama. 
 One wonders why anyone would try to rehash successful movie plots that have already been seen like it's the case with this movie. The Wedding Date is one of the best examples of why not to even try to remake under the guise of a new story something that should have been let alone. If a project like this goes ahead with the studio big honchos' approval then go all out with big stars and glossy production values that way people will come for the stars. Alas that's not what happens in this misguided attempt at comedy. The problem seems to be the way the screen writers have transplanted the story to London when basically this seems to be a typical American situation that not even the setting will be able to fix. Then there is the problem with the stars. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulrooney? They have as much chemistry as oil and vinegar! Since the Kat and Nick have no conflict from the start the viewer is not pulled into the film the way the creators thought they would be. It's clear that Kat will fall for Nick and vice-versa in this predictable story. Amy Adams who was the best asset in Junebug comes across as a shallow girl who is willing to keep her lie going on and not come clean to the man that loves her and is going to marry her. For anyone interested the credits at the end of the film run for almost seven minutes! 
 This film breeches the fine line between satire and silliness. While a bridge system that has no rules may promote marital harmony it certainly can't promote winning bridge so the satire didn't work for me. But there were some items I found enjoyable anyway especially with the big bridge match between Paul Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk near the end of the film. It is treated like very much like a championship boxing match. Not only is the arena for the contest roped off in a square area like a boxing ring there is a referee hovering between the contestants and radio broadcaster Roscoe Karns delivers nonstop chatter on the happenings. At one point he even enumerates One... Two... Three... Four... as though a bid of four diamonds was a knockdown event. And people were glued to their radios for it all a common event for championship boxing matches. That spoof worked very well indeed. Unfortunately few of the actors provide the comedy needed to sustain the intended satire. Paul Lukas doesn't have much of a flair for comedy and is miscast; lovely Loretta Young and the usual comic Frank McHugh weren't given good enough lines; Glenda Farrell has a nice comic turn as a forgetful blonde at the start of the film but she practically disappears thereafter. What a waste of talent! 
 Here's a review for people like me. This movie sucks from beginning to end. I threw popcorn at the screen and resorted to entertaining myself a la MSF2000. The plot hinges on chance happenings and relies on stupidity from people who are supposed to be smart. The lead falls for a con man and it doesn't occur to her that she might get conned????? And she's rich???? And she's a famous psychologist????? COME ON people. She enters the bar at just the most convenient moment when everyone is assembled to talk about conning her??? That was so staged that it felt like slap in the face to even half-witted movie viewers. Rain man would have been insulted. I also admit that I despise Mamet dialogue with the kind of passion that some people have for meat-eaters war-starters and fur-wearers. My hatred is so complete that it defies logic. But I'll give it a shot. That it's not supposed to sound real is fine. I don't care. It's that everyone talks the SAME. Mamet can't create characters; all he can do is foist his voice on us relentlessly through different actors. No wonder his actors are so wooden. They're confused about everyone being the same character. (However his later films do improve.) 
 I've been a fan of all things Bill Maher for 15 years but this film was disappointing and at times disgusting. Of course I am Catholic come from a well-educated family and go to church of my own volition which probably puts me at ends with quite a few of Bill's opinions. Bill's problem is that he presumes that religion is uniformly negative. He's correct to document the sociological aspects of it i.e. one faith builds its holidays on top of another and that many wars have been started because of religion (or more accurately by the sinister appeals of men to the ultimate and unquestionable authority of God) but that said he never looks at its positive side. Quite frankly I think that hell would freeze over before Bill would ever humble himself and travel to the slums of Calcutta where Mother Theresa spent her life working with the poorest of the poor. She's dead now of course but he could easily visit the Jesuit priest in East LA who runs Homeboy Industries which works with young men typically with gang and prison backgrounds to teach them career skills get their tattoos removed and to become responsible members of society or he could visit USC's Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies which has brought together some of the world's finest theologians diplomats and investment bankers to study ways in which to ethically integrate the world's poorest countries into global capital markets and thereby improve the standard of living for the half of the world's people who live on less than $1 a day. Of course he won't do that because that would require him to consider evidence that does not easily fit into his preconceived beliefs about religion and it's so much easier to continue to make snide superficial jokes. That fits into the other large problem with Bill's movie which is that he never subjects himself to anyone either on his level or who is better than he is. In this movie you have Maher the Cornell grad spend most of his time talking down to truck drivers at a nondenominational Christian truck stop service in a night club with a Dutch guy who smokes pot all the time with the minister of a storefront church in Miami who claims to be the reincarnation of Christ and with an actor playing Jesus at a Holy Land theme park. What you won't see in Bill's film beyond some superficial speculation alongside a Ph.D in Grand Central Station that religion chemically alters the brain like drugs do and that religion is the fallacy of tradition wrought on the masses is any sort of serious and questioning interviews with philosophy and theology professors from schools like Notre Dame BYU or Wheaton College who could easily rhetorically decapitate him in a debate on the matter. You won't see any serious discussion of any of the writings of C.S. Lewis G.K. Chesterton or any papal encyclicals and of course you also won't find any discussion whatsoever of any of the non-Abrahamic (Judaism Christianity and Islam) faiths whatsoever. All you get at the end of the day is a textbook example of a condescending snobby elitist from the west side of LA who makes a movie for his own kind and who has absolutely no gut-level understanding whatsoever of how the other half of America that elected George W. Bush (twice) lives their lives or about the school of thought behind it. I get a lot of what Bill's saying but for someone possessing his intellect and influence this film was nothing less than pathetic. Anyone interested in the kind of intellectual ferment that indie documentaries typically bring could find more stimulation in an old rerun of the Teletubbies. 
 This is easily the worst movie i have EVER seen. I'm not exaggerating I told the guy at Blockbuster that they should take it off the shelves. The only thing interesting about this movie is the box. On the box it says from the director of the boogeyman so I figured...eh whatever if this was made recently I'm sure the directing at least won't be TOO bad :-\ but after I saw the movie and looked at what boogeyman they were talking about it's some nonsense from the early 1980's that he made. Great way to rope in unsuspecting viewers. ANYWAY I think that they just liked the name Zodiac Killer and didn't bother to research any of the actual Zodiac's crimes or his MO or even the years that he was active. All of the crimes they talk about have nothing to do with the Zodiac and the stories about the original Zodiac take place several years after the actual Zodiac's crimes did. They also compare the Zodiac to Vampire of Dusseldorf Fritz Haarman throughout the movie and talk to Fritz's son quite often. The Zodiac and Haarman were nothing alike and it makes more sense to compare him to BTK who also shot people not a man who killed people by chewing through their necks. None of the Haarman facts are correct either just a bunch of jumbled nonsense. His son even says Don't forget his name was Fritz Haarman with 2 t's ...His actual name just has one! I think that the writer/director simply typed in a google search for serial killers and the quickest ones that came up were the Zodiac Killer and Fritz Haarman. Ooh those sound like cool names let's make a movie about them without doing any outside research! great idea! Perhaps my favorite inconsistency in this movie is the way that the experts as well as the young killer describe suffering from DSM-IV and getting cured of it. I was also diagnosed with DSM-IV and have since recovered etc. For those of you who don't know DSM-IV is the psychological manual for mental disorders. If anybody suffers from the book itself then they must have some SERIOUS problems! Haha. Anyway my point is that this goes on the bottom of my top 5 worst movies of all time list and it's rare that a movie ever reaches that point. But if you are interested in watching a totally non-fact based story about serial killers that happens to be nothing more than boring full of inexperienced actors and not completely rational I'd say check out this movie. ...Oh and I liked how the killer tear gassed a few of his victims with dry ice. Nice touch... 
 This is possibly the worst of all the Columbo movies. Andrew Stevens' acting is poor as the villain and the plot is weak. In fact none of the cast seem able to act other than Peter Falk who puts in a creditable performance as the Lieutenant. 
 I'm giving this movie a 1 because there are no negative numbers in IMDb rating system. this movie was horrible. It was very badly acted the story was poorly written the action was unbelievable. I doubt even the Salvation Army could battle as poorly as the troops did in this film. I won't even write any plot spoilers because the movie just isn't good enough for plot spoilers. To write comments on the plot would be pointless. If I were to compare this movie I'd have to compare it to Reign of Fire however although I didn't like Reign of Fire either that movie at least was better than this one. Some of the people in the theater left before the movie was even halfway done. The only reason I didn't was because I simply didn't think to do it. I was hoping for a feast of CGI and fighting masterfully done but that isn't what happened. The martial arts lasted all of 30 seconds and that was from an exercise routine done during the flash-back scene very disappointing. The CGI was not done well either. One scene comes to mind. During one of the earlier tank battles the troops are firing away at......nothing. Someone forgot to cue the animation guys on that bit of film so the street was totally devoid of bad guys. I'm also thinking the bad guy's voice was dubbed by the voice-over of Imotep from The Mummy movies. Had that same scraggly echoing thing going on. (Someone owed some royalties here?) Since I mentioned the fight scene I'll say yeah that might be considered a spoiler but only to the purists I suppose. Don't go see it don't buy the DVD when it comes out either. You have been warned. 
 Gods I haven't watched a movie this awful in a long while. Maybe not since 'The New Guy' or various Freddie Prinze Jr. movies. Yes it is that astoundingly awful. Mira Sorvino's blank and wooden acting surely must've been inspired by Freddie. The movie staging was awkward (like a play rather and that feeling of confinement does NOT work well on film). The actors had no idea what they were doing especially Sorvino. Her accent was awful and her sex appeal non-existent here so it was painful to see her 'seducing' other characters and they 'falling' for it. And what was with the occaisional shots of a live audience in lawn chairs? Nonsensical! I had to turn the dvd player off it would have been self-inflicted pain to finish this film. 
 Believe it or don't i have my very own DVD copy of this movie which i bought at Walgreens for a great big whole dollar. I'm still not sure if it was a dollar well spent or a dollar foolishly wasted. Pretty amazing set designs and costumes. Apparently much thought and effort went into their making. The set designs are very Mexican in stylization. I liked them a lot. And Santa is impressive. One of the more impressive Santas in moviedom. I'm guessing the original intent and purpose of this movie was to be something uplifting and cheerful for a kids audience. But somehow it comes across quite deranged. In fact i'm left stunned at how deranged it is. Maybe it's the English dubbing that makes it seems so deranged and bizarre. One of the reasons i prefer to experience movies in the original language they were made and the use of English subtitles as dubbing often gives an unintended strangeness. The kid voices were at least dubbed with actual kid voices as opposed to women pretending to be kids which tends to sound very very weird. Did you know that demons in hell spend their free time dancing around doing ballet in their longjohns? You didn't? Neither did i until i watched this movie. One learns something new everyday. Is this movie actually worth watching? Now that's a tossup. I can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone as it's quite disturbing in its own bizarre way. Yet its unintentional bizarreness is what makes it worth watching. You decide what you're going to do. I dunno... for myself it made me feel uncomfortable seeing demons constantly doing cutesy ballet moves. Now that's just wrong... 
 When i saw the preview for this on TV i was thinking ok its gonna be a good werewolf movie but it was not. it was not scary at all! acting was good plot was horrible the military bid was just plain stupid. I think the SCI-FI channel could of done better than this piece of crap. The movie made it sound like Arron was going to turn into a werewolf instead he turned psycho and bit some doctor's throat out. If you have read some of my other reviews on other movies there all positive but this one is not simply because the story was terrible. One out of 10 max. Im sure you all were expecting some werewolf flick but i bet you didn't expect this. Beyond Loch Nes was way better than this movie heck any movie thats on the sci-fi channel is better than this movie. 
 I rented this film out having heard of the fuss about it not being put up for an Academy Award but after watching it it's easy to see why it didn't. Despite the beautiful photography the film is incredibly slow moving despite having hardly any plot. The plot is about a young boy trying to come to terms with his parents' death in what may or may not have been an accident (the film is never clear on this) and how his grandfather used to tell him fairy stories. The fairy stories contain the only bits of interest in the plot but they're very short and don't really seem to have any point. The first fairy story in particular concerns a boy trying to get a magical flower to his dying girlfriend to save her life but the boy delays by tasting the flower first to make sure it is not poisonous which results in him being a few seconds too late to save his girlfriend - the grandfather then pronounces that the moral is that the boy was too impatient but that doesn't make any sense because it was overcaution and slowness which resulted in his failure. Perfect metaphor for this film really. The photography of Skye is beautiful though but then Stardust which was released this year is another film about fairy stories filmed in Skye and beautifully photographed - and it's infinitely better than this one. 
 This was so far the worst movie I have seen in my entire life and I have seen some REALLY bad movies. I saw this movie at my local video store and the cover looked like it could be a decent horror movie. Little did I know that the cover would be the best part of the movie. Where to start? The filming of the movie was scattered and boring. At one point there is a one-minute scene of no one talking just a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day. Nothing happened they just drove in silence. The whole movie is boring with annoying unbelievable dialogue and basically no plot to speak of. If you rent this movie watch it with some friends and it might make a good comedy. Otherwise when you see this movie run. 
 The only redeeming quality of this overlong miscast melodrama is the scenery of southern France and the voice of Nana Mascouri singing the theme song. Stephanie Powers is miscast and betrayed by a phony accent. As has been pointed out she is too old to play an 18 year old and looks far too young as a grandmother with a college age granddaughter? Lee Remick is good although she also is ageless in her later years. The talented Joanna Lumley is under utilized and also manages to look forever young when her middle aged son (Robert Urich) finally marries Grandma Stephanie Powers. Stacey Keach's ceaseless arrogance makes you wonder what these women saw in him. Don't know how any viewer could relate to his excessive portrayal? The most credible performance is given by Ian Richardson who makes the rest of the cast look like rank amateurs. It strains credulity that the handsome male suitors in this epic would remain ever single while they patiently await the subject of their affections to finally consent to accept them. Can anybody believe that handsome Robert Urich would remain single for decades waiting for Stephanie Powers to finally accept his endless marriage proposals? The WW2 engagement between the Wehrmacht and the Marquis is laughable. To begin with the Germans did not occupy the Provence section of France until late in the war it was controlled by the Vichy French puppet government. We see the French resistance staging a daylight raid on Mistral's villa to steal sheets after which they all lounge under a bridge waiting for a lumbering truckload of Nazi troops to surprise and annihilate them? If you want to see a well acted mini-series set in a foreign country don't watch Mistral's Daughter. A far better alternative would be The Thorn Birds. 
 Beginning with the poster (featuring only Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey) the entire movie was a fraud. One stereotype after another this movie was about nothing - or nothing new at least. After 10-15 minutes you realize that you've just paid to see Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J recite their way through another cop-flick. Basically the story is about the corrupt system in some city all secretly supported by the backbone business and in town under the watchful eye of some hot-shot politician. The almighty and above-the-law organization is called FRAT and guess what? they've got a kick-ass loony cop shooting and beating at will - suspects girlfriends you name it. FRAT cops are corrupt and greedy so they end up making mistakes that get discovered by a young and talented (!!!) journalist. One hour later after a series of unbelievably bad-made shooting scenes and more stereotype lines everything ends happily and we get served the final line : you can't beat the system. Bah! Don't see this waste of film roll. Freeman and Spacey barely have 10 min altogether! 
 The Cobweb is an example of many examples of movies that feature strong sometimes noteworthy performances and high points but unfortunately are shattered and slowed down drastically by a murky plot and very little to interest the audience. It stars Richard Widmark as a doctor working at a mental institution whose life becomes in turmoil due to family problems and a rather ludicrous and overworked conflict that really seems like no big deal at all. The plot is preposterous. Its time for the institution to get new drapes for the library windows. One old woman wants to have her drapes put over them but a lot of the patients want to make their own. And somehow this ridiculous and unintentionally loony conflict breaks out into the point where lives are in danger and families start to fall apart. It sounds more like a conflict that would occur between very young children. The questioning of the logic of the plot and whether it could really happen is so massive that one wonders if only a real-like lunatic could buy it. Don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with the acting. The cast following Widmark is composed of other great actors many of them Academy Award-nominees and winners. And there is occasionally a moment in the film that works out brilliantly but it always excludes the stupid plot about window drapes. Unfortunately there is too much about the doggone drapes and thus the movie slows down. A lot of the takes are long and done from one camera viewpoint adhering to the slow pacing and lack of viewing interest. In a short analysis The Cobweb is an unrecognized film and it becomes obvious why to the viewers basically as soon as the plot comes into focus which it does pretty quickly. It just really doesn't sound like much fun to watch and I tell you that it is not much fun to watch. 
 First I'd like to excuse my bad English. I'm not a HOSTEL-hardcore-fan but I liked that movie nevertheless. Live Feed however SUCKED BIG TIME! I have never seen a gore-movie with superb acting but hey who's surprised? The acting in Live Feed was... well not there! I've seen some commented this as it must have been a school project or something. Okey but not by students in media or acting school. This was NO class at all! And what about the story? A really sad rip-off on Hostel. And what about the gore? What about the psychopathic torture scenes that supposed to make your guts twist and leave you cold-sweating? That was the most disappointing about the hole movie! Short quick and NO edge. More like an execution rather than a torture. Okey there where buckets of blood but it didn't even look real. The slaughtering and the violence reminded more of Braindead than Hostel or any of the Saw-movies. And Braindead was fun! Okey I laughed at Live Feed a couple of times but that was more out of disappointment than out of sheer fun! So instead of wasting 80 minutes by watching Live Feed watch ANYTHING else! 
 Vovochka is your everyday hooligan vs authority movie. Vovochka the main character is branded early as a bad influence on the children in the neighborhood. With the words of wisdom from a couple of grownups he meets along the way he finds changing his mischievous ways hard yet worthy of doing. Personally I found actor who played Vovochka too annoying to sympathize with however the change of tone of the movie would allow most to feel the emotional struggle Vovochka has when he wants to be good but bad things still happen. This struggle makes the movie a little different than other movies of the same genre that's the little flavor I meant. All in all I did not really care for this movie although it was most likely aimed for a younger audience. 
 Mad Dog Time ... Trigger Happy whatever you wanna call it...simply doesn't hit the mark. Maybe its just me maybe i just don't like Gangster comedies ( as i thought Oscar Johney Dangerously and Mafia also sucked ) It's probably more witty sharp wordplay than all out Comedy only its not as witty and sharp as it ( or the other reviewers )Make it out to be. The Rick Mick Vic Thing was old to begin with making it a running gag was at times painful to watch. There wasn't enough Changes of Location or Feel for the period they were supposed to be in. The Majority of the film was either set in Dreyfus's Club or a variety of Offices /dim rooms... ( what was with that Sit down Gun stand off thing Goldblum kept winning ?) The supporting cast was... on Paper excellent ( great to see Silva & Drago)but characters were killed off before they had time to develop. and Richard Pryors cameo was a Joke ! The Romance and Love element of the film also bogged it down. 4/10 I don't think i'll return to it anytime soon. 
 I just saw this movie on Flix after timer-taping it. I grew up watching F Troop and had a major hard for Wrangler Jane so I was shocked literally shocked to find out after seeing this film that the degenerate homicidal nurse was Melody Patterson who looks pretty good but also looks completely different and is unfortunately poorly photographed. I would never have guessed it was her in a million years. What the hell is she doing in a picture like this? I agree with the guys here that the movie lacks what it's pushing. No sex no gore no tease. It's also a remake of the Atomic Brain aka Monstrosity (1964 or thereabouts). Most of the action is tedious; the main character spends enormous amounts of time running around the crazed doctor's house and basement and the neighborhood in general or being roughed up by the cop all of it boring and time-filling. Now if the Italians would have made this half the film would have been the Slingblade/Uncle Ernest/Jack Elam henchman fondling the unconscious nude girls. But you only get that for 20 seconds. 
 I basically skimmed through the movie but just enough to catch watch the plot was about. To tell you the truth it was kind of boring to me and at some spots it didn't make sense. The only reason I watched this movie in the first place was to see CHACE CRAWFORD!!! He is so hot but in this movie his hair was kind of weird. But still hot. However despite how hot CHACE is it really did not make up for the film. I guess the plot isn't that bad but what really threw me over was the fact that they cuss in like every sentence. Is it that hard to express your anger without saying the F word every time?The cussing was annoying and the whole flashy camera shaking thing gave me a headache. All in all although the plot was OK I found the film to be a bore and over dramatic. That's why I only cut to scenes with CHACE in it. LOL Anyways not worth renting unless your a die-hard fan of a specific cast member like I was. Oh yeah the cast was Hot. The girls were HOT!!! But CHACE IS THE BEST!! 
 If you're watching this without an inkling of an idea what the story is about then you're in for quite the surprise. Even then the synopsis has painted a picture of a rather sane storyline but the actual film is anything but. As the synopsis went it tells of an obsessed mountain climber which you'll see as the prologue before the opening credits and text crawl which tells you of the presence of Chronopolis an imaginary city that exists in dreamy manuscripts of the mind (note to self ? this spells trouble with flashing lights) where its inhabitants are immortals yearning for a change in their omnipresence. They can see our world and notice of all persons this mountain climber and the synopsis explained that they decided to contact him through alchemy creating an intelligent sphere to meet the man. What that translated to is a repetitive piece of animation that a 5 year old kid could produce. Have shapes created though credit goes to the stop motion style and put it through a mind-numbing loop. And repeat until your eyes start to close then move on to the next scene. If anything the Chonopolisians (if this term exists) really love their sticks and balls constantly playing at conjuring up that magical sphere and having a field day playing with it before releasing it to the other world. It gets no better as well when the man interacts with the sphere in yet another hypnotically boring and sleep inducing sequence. Thank goodness of course that the run time is shorter than what's advertised which is 57 minutes (or less) against the 70 stated. While firmly dated its dull colours non-existent story scratchy soundtrack and repetitive pictures will win over no fans. Don't waste time. 
 First off let me say that this has to be on the top of my list of boring movies. Nothing and I mean nothing in this movie is even remotely thrilling. Most of it is very confusing and as it progresses you just wish it would end!! Some people want a movie that makes them think through the entire thing to which I say... More power to you !! I on the other hand just want to be entertained. Which brings me back to this stinker entertainment it is not. This movie is stupid and a complete waste of time. Seems that most here agree also. Most of this didn't make any sense and by the time you think you have one scene figured out another lame scene comes around and....well I guess you see where this is going. Avoid this one sucks....bad!! 
 Without question the worst ELVIS film ever made. The movie portrays all Indians as drunk stupid and lazy. Watch ELVIS's skin change color throughout the film. 
 I read one other review that expressed the view that Platoon was a never ending cycle of marines killing people being killed taking drugs and talking trash. I don't agree with that because the film actually had more to it but it a way I can see what this person is trying to say: this had no real plot - which is a point i agree with. It is self-indulgent Stone at his best. He really wanted to show not only how war leads to death but also how it is extremely traumatic on those who survive. Unfortunately the film seems to over glorify this aspect and the grand finale is just way too champagne grand-standing Oscar-hunting let's create an enduring image for my liking. The problem I have with Stone and other film-makers of his ilk is that they fail to understand this simply concept: depicting the terribly bloody deadly waste that war is DOES NOT PROVE OR EVEN REFLECT ON WHETHER it was an unjust or immoral war. We have seen the same thing emerge at the moment with Iraq. In case you're missing the point let me put it to you bluntly: if you saw how truly bloody the second world war was and how destructive it was on the lives of the surviving soldiers would you think it was an unjust war? If that fact alone doesn't convince you that it was an unjust war then why should depictions of the horrors of Vietnam convince you that it was wrong to go to war in that instance. Personally I do not support America's decision to go to war in Vietnam but i certainly don't subscribe to the this war is wrong because people died and suffered theory. I don't think that motivations are always wrong by default just because war in itself is terrible. This says nothing of the fact that the ending or the final big twist was a bit stupid. However this is not Stones first oddball departure. Wall street was a magnificent film up until the last 30 minutes or so when it made a dreadful wrong turn. JFK is probably one of the few films Stone did that actually ended very well. But it hardly matters in this one because there was very little plot up until that point of the film to twist around. And this is why i gave it such a low mark. It was virtually story-less and ultimately boring - unless you fell for the manufactured poignancy. 
 This Hal Roach comedy short A Tough Winter is the ninety-ninth in the Our Gang/Little Rascals series and the eleventh talkie. Bascally a showcase for black comic Stepin Fetchit who gets special billing here we see him going to his shack where the gang hangs out. Farina retrieves a love letter from the mail for him and is told by Stepin to read it since he can't read it during the day as he goes to NIGHT school. It happens to be from his sweetheart in Tennesse so now Farina has to have his ears stuffed with cotton since it's too hot for him to hear! In another room Weezer relays instructions to Mary Ann of making taffy from the radio but because he keeps running back and forth to the kitchen he misses the lady announcer's segue to rice pudding and Spanish tamale confusing Mary Ann with additions of Tabasco and Lux! After the concoction is completed Jackie and the rest of the gang help themselves with the awful tasting but very sticky substance as everyone gets stuck on the walls as a result. As they all try to clean the mess Stepin works in the basement on various pipes and electrical outlets that mixes variable appliances' functions such a telephone that vacuums a vacuum that rings and a refrigerator that plays music! The End. What I've just described portends the meandering nature of this Our Gang short that served as the pilot for a potential Stepin Fetchit movie short series. It's just as well that it never took place as Fetchit's characterization of the lazy Negro was amusing only in small doses and would be considered highly offensive today. Many of the scenes I've just described are good for some laughs though the final sequence was so confusing that the results were just too blah for me. So in summary A Tough Winter is a curio worth seeing at least once. By the way Stepin's real name was Lincoln Theodore Perry. 
 This film was terrible. OK my favourite film is 'The Wicker Man' (1973) so I was always bound to be a little biased. The plot rambles along throwing out enough of the key elements of the original to make the term 'remake' highly dubious. (He's not a virgin but IS allergic to bees. WOW!) So many things happen that make no sense and are unexplained which I'm afraid Mr LaBute does not a horror movie make. (How are two people we clearly saw blown up in a car at the start alive and well at the end of the film?) Cage looks haggard and bewildered throughout and his character is prone to calling out Rowan!? at the slightest noise. The 'nods' to the original are irritating as they come off as tacky rather than as intelligent homage. For example certain incidents mirror the original (The girl falling out of a cupboard pretending to be dead when Woodward/Cage is searching the island) and several lines of dialogue are plucked straight from Anthony Schaffers original screenplay and shoehorned in. I'm sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis than this I really can't be bothered to write any more about this film. It lacks any kind of substance. Throw it on the scrap heap with all the other remakes that have sullied the good names of the films they were 'based' on (in this case very loosely). 
 This is indeed a god adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. Compared with the American Version with Guinneth Paltrow the script was written to resemble as much as possible the book. But the acting was awful. Besides Kate Beckinsale who I believe was a true likeness of the Emma in the book all the other actors were trying too hard. Mark Strong was not the gentleman he was supposed to be. He was often rude and offensive had no feeling whatsoever and throughout the entire film you could not see his love growing for Emma at all. This had a terrible effect on Kate Beckinsale who seemed to be trying to resque her leading role as well as her partner's. Moreover there was no chemistry between the entire cast. Hariett Smith played by Samantha Morton seemed to have no real attachment to Mr. Elton played by Dominic Rowan. Therefore she did not seem as heartbroken as she was portrayed in the book. The settings of the film are also too poor. The costumes are even more so. I would have imagined Emma Woodhouse to dress in a more fashionable and elegant way that she does here. The ending is also too long. It is good that it resembles the book's ending but it is a killer ending for a film. And again I can see no feeling of happiness in the face of Mr.Knightley. To conclude I believed this adaptation to be loyal to the book but with poor actors. It seemed as if the film was made without any budget at all. I would prefer to see the lighter version with Paltrow and Northam even if it is clear that it was made to be a blockbuster than to watch these actors (excepting the good Olivia Williams and the better Kate Beckinsale) ruin the entire script. 
 I'm never much for classic films. Movies like Patton Going My Way How Green was My Valley The Godfather Casablanca Annie Hall Gone with the Wind Lawrence of Arabia and Citizen Kane bore me. However I would much rather watch any one of those films 3 469 times while being tied up on a chair than watch An American in Paris once in the most luxurious suite ever. If I did the latter I'd probably be sleeping the entire time. The color art direction and the music didn't interest me Gershwin or non-Gershwin. The dancing and the singing could help an insomniac fall to sleep. The dialogue doesn't match up to Singin' in the Rain. Basically this movie is boring. The only other film that I fell asleep while watching was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. But you can't blame me. I only slept 5 minutes the night before. 1 star/10 (Too bad we can't give zeroes.) 
 Prom Night is about a girl named Donna (Brittany Snow) who is being chased by a psycho killer trying to kill her at her prom night. And by doing so killing her family friends and her enemies. Now before I begin let me say have you been tired of PG-13 horror movies that haven't been scary lately. Are you tired of stupid girl dialog 'Oh my god' and talking about girlish things. And are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying. And the last thing are you tired of the US remaking Asian Japanese and Chinese films. That pretty much sums up Prom night but I'm still not done with the review. The only reason to see 'Prom night' is to crack a laugh at the kills. If not don't see Prom night. You never see the kills an only hear screaming and you see some blood on the wall. And by the way the deaths are repeating like 24/7. So not only aren't they scary but it's obnoxious. By the time I met the cast I think I was ready to hurl. Too much girl talk too much guy talk and lots of 'Oh my gosh. It's our prom'. I understand it's fun but seriously is it too much to ask not to concentrate. If I were to put Prom Night on the list of worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films I'd be the first one too. I'm not going to be surprised if it gets released on DVD for cheap and quick. Seriously don't spend your money or the time for dull acting cheap scares and a 'Night to die for' when watching the film. 1 star out of 10. (P.S. If I could give the film zero stars I would). 
 I rented this DVD for two reasons. A cast of great actors and the director even though Robert Altman can be hit or miss. In this case it was a big miss. Altman's attempt at creating suspense fell on its keester. After seeing Kenneth Branagh in a good film like Dead Again I didn't think he could possibly contribute to such a turkey and I hope it didn't ruin his reputation. Robert Duvall seems to have fallen the way of most one-time Oscar winners. On a downward spiral that includes acting in eating-money films such as this one. Duvall was once a great actor in excellent films even though his best performance was not Tender Mercies but The Great Santini . This movie was truly a big waste of time. I give it a 2 out of 10. 
 About halfway through I realized I didn't care about these characters in the least; however I watched a bit more anyway. Regrettably I came back the next day and finished it. I shouldn't have bothered. If you know *anything* about the film beforehand you know that the lead character will be a plane crash survivor - and the title gives you a pretty good idea of what's gonna happen afterward - he's gonna get on the phone and call people about it! That was almost as bad as Snakes on a Plane (another bad aviation catastrophe flick). I realize this is an old film and the acting style in those days was much less naturalistic than today. But even by those standards the acting was embarrassing. These weren't characters they were stereotypes. I suspect this movie was more than anything an attempt by Bette Davis to help her husband's (Gary Merrill) career. To no avail however - I have seen oak trees display more genuine emotion than he did. Davis' playing the happy cripple (i.e. a non-glamorous role) was probably looked on as an edgy and bold career move. It wasn't. It was just boring. She was a kind of Tiny Tim in the film making Trask (Merrill's character) see the truth about love and forgiveness (although she was less winsome than Tiny Tim) calmly dispensing wisdom about life and relationships without a hint that her beloved husband had just died. The final scene where Trask calls his wife back in Iowa to reconcile was so affected and over-acted on both ends of the phone line I almost cringed. I had to remind myself that these people actually got paid for what they were doing in this film. I noticed a lot of people seem to have enjoyed this movie. If you found it uplifting that's great. But frankly I just found it bad. There are plenty of old movies from the Golden Age of Hollywood that were far better written and acted. 
 You wouldn't expect a movie like this to be good and it isn't. It's a no budget ultra violent zombie movie filmed with a bad looking hand-held camera...and it's hilarious. The actors obviously have never acted before and it shows in their terrible hilarious readings. There is no plot to be seen. The little plot I could find seemed to be that a government experiment escaped and a group of zombie seems to be terrorizing a couple families. The gore effects are actually some of the most sickening I've ever seen. It seems the gore effects people raided a butcher shop for all the body parts and many scenes involve zombies dismembering people and eating their organs. It's a funny and sickening film and it's about as bad as you can get in terms of any movie. My rating: BOMB/****. 90 mins. 
 Who are these They - the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot? TOO much fun nobody is getting any actual work done and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet but have an embarrassing look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn drawing on her dignity manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself ostensibly.) Everybody looks great but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys even apart from her singing which while competent is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight but at least they were long on charm. They All Laughed tries to coast on its good intentions but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular. His rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of Hollywood stories so there's no joy in criticizing the film... there _is_ real emotional investment in Ms. Stratten's scenes. But Laughed is a faint echo of The Last Picture Show Paper Moon or What's Up Doc - following Daisy Miller and At Long Last Love it was a thundering confirmation of the phase from which P.B. has never emerged. All in all though the movie is harmless only a waste of rental. I want to watch people having a good time I'll go to the park on a sunny day. For filmic expressions of joy and love I'll stick to Ernest Lubitsch and Jaques Demy... 
 While on a vacation at the beach red-haired brothers Michael McGreevey and Billy Mumy (as Arthur and Petey Loomis) find a seal. The lads christen their critter Sammy and spend summertime frolicking with the sandy sea lion. When it's time to go home the boys begin to suffer separation anxiety. Young Mr. McGreevey decides they can't take Sammy back to Disneyland ? er Gatesville - but young Mr. Mumy packs him anyway. At home they try to hide the Way-out Seal from adults and of course? hijacks ensue! **** Sammy - The Way-out Seal pt 1 (10/28/62) Norman Tokar ~ Michael McGreevey Bill Mumy Robert Culp 
 Horror movies can be a lot of fun with low budgets bad acting and a bit of panache. I think the film is just missing panache because one thuddingly dull scene after another people make laughably harmless claw-handed grabs at the air. If it weren't so boring it might be funny. A horror film can go a long way with a tired concept like college kids in a haunted house in much the same way the Evil Dead movies had a lot of fun with a similar standard plotline. Hallow's End unfortunately doesn't go a long way. Actually it doesn't go anywhere. It spends the better part of an hour setting up faceless and anonymous characters with what seem like endless interpersonal drama. I have nothing against character development not even in a horror movie but these are strictly one-dimensional characters (the alpha-male the milquetoast the... um... throwaway characters that exist mostly for sex scenes.) Spending forty-plus bloodless droning minutes with them was more horrific than when the bloodshed started. Well implied bloodshed anyway. When the college kids turn into whatever they dressed as for their haunted house (one's a vampire one's wearing O.R. scrubs and some white pancake) they look pretty much the way they did in their amateur haunted house costumes; The Dead Hate The Living using a similar theme is a masterwork in comparison. There isn't really any gore to speak of nor are there any real scares. I've thought about this one from almost every approach. If it was supposed to be a tight suspenseful horror movie (which would explain why things moved so slowly) the pathetic sex scenes and cheap monsters would invalidate it. If it was supposed to be a genuine blood & guts horror movie (which would explain the schlock)... where's the blood and guts? And the anticlimax is one of the unexciting endings to a movie I've ever seen. It's the kind of movie that though it doesn't have a narrator through the film is bookended by voice-overs because all of the meaningless dialogue just wasn't enough. This was a hard one... coming out of it I wonder if I've just sat through a christian horror film. Maybe the I know hell exists of the opening wasn't meant that way but there are some hints (or misdirection-- I'm not sure which). For all the profanity in the film a line like gosh-darnit comes off a little absurd and so does most of the crucifix worshipping god-fearing and satan-dreading especially after some lecherous T&A sex scenes (one heterosexual one lesbian). If it a christian company (Highland Myst's logo even has a bit of a crucifix resemblance) then this film weighs in heavily for the atheist camp. An omnipotent being can't be this bad a filmmaker. 
 This movie was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Here are the things that immediately jump out at me: 1. The woods were more like hills in Los Angeles with a couple trees and brush. Not scary whatsoever. News flash if you are filming in the Southern California area big bear is only an hour away. They actually have trees there. 2. The writing was absolutely without a doubt the worst dialogue I have ever experienced. Every possible line in the movie was unoriginal clich or just plain stupid. For instance the name of the camp is camp blood (lame) the name of the clown is the killer clown (lame). What is a clown doing in a forest anyway? Was that the only mask they could find? 3. The last but certainly the least was the acting. Absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled. A virtual cornucopia of shitty lines and poor acting. Worst part by far was when then randomly flash back to this fat foreign girl getting naked for a a photograph. It's a really long scene and I guess she was supposed to be sexy but she was NOT. Also and this was one of the few enjoyable parts of the movie for me was this tool who is supposed to be athletic. For instance when he is bored in the movie he grabs a couple rocks and starts doing curls with them. Then later on he is supposed to be running for the clown and it is immediately clear with his very girl like run that he is quite far from athletic. Oh and to the girl who played Kat good Lord stop singing. That song you sang for the credits makes me want to kill myself. If for some reason you do see this movie I would at least recommend watching the special features. The group of jackasses who made this film talk about it as if it is this really original story. In fact one of the girls actually says that she let some of her friends read the screenplay and none of them could predict the ending. Apparently she hangs out with special kids. 
 This movie is phoniness incarnate a straight 11 / 10 on the phoniness scale. The fakeness of the accents as well as the tightness of the cardigan spandex pants are just staggering. Yanks although the real Scotland may be just as colourful if you ever go there don't expect to be given much of a the chance to dance out controversies with the locals. Also don't attempt to sway local opinion through the otherwise fine art of tapdancing. There are a couple of infectious singing-and-dancing scenes but the plot is far too cheesy and linear and the dialogue is often too weak. I also doubt whether anyone would want to be stuck in a timewarped 18.th-century Scottish village in the boondocks rather than gay New York City. Maybe it wasn't such a big sacrifice for that priest to have left Brigadoon maybe he was just trying to get the hell out of that dump. Watch it for the fine alternative-reality view of what a Christopher Streed Day-parade in Scotland would look like on LSD. Other than that I'd only recommend it to Hollywood muscial completists. 
 Its unfortunate that someone decided to spin off on the best horror movies of all time in my book. This poor copy steals lots of material from the first three films going as far as even copying how persons die and what will happen in the future to the key characters and it basically tries to cram in three films into one and fails. It fails even to create a good scary atmosphere for one (except with the odd exception where the impressive choral music brings back memories of the old films). The only thing we can be thankful for is that there has not been an Omen V. 
 One of the worst romantic comedies (nay worst movies) I've ever seen. Boy (who works as a phone psychic!) must pretend to be gay to move into apartment with woman of his dreams. Hilarity does not ensue. Boredom light gay-bashing and horrible dialogue do. If you read Brad Meltzer and like his crappy dialogue you'll like this movie. Be smart. Avoid this. if you see it destroy the copy. 
 This movie was one of the greatest movies ever made it had everything to make a movie great. Incredible acting awesome special effects...... oh wait I must be thinking of a good movie. Well this wasn't one of them it just plain sucked. What I want to know is what kind of bone head would think that this movie was a 10. When I casted my vote there were 206 out there god knows what goes on in their head. Now as for any other vote a 8 or 9 was even too high but a 10??? Come on what made this movie sooooo good to give it a 10? I know these are the same 206 that thought that Jean Claude Van Damme is a great dramatic actor. 
 Almost from the word go this film is poor and lacking conviction but then again most people would struggle to show commitment to a script as uninspiring as this. The dialogue really does not flow and sometimes as in this case more is less (or should have been). This is also backed-up by odd scenes (e.g. the Cemetry slow-motion walk) that you think might lead somewhere but only seem to waste a few more seconds of your life. The plot is a strange combination of gangster / situation comedy which I am sure seemed a good idea at the time but if ever there was a case for someone needing to be honest with the scriptwriter then here was it. Martin Freeman is okay but then he seems to have one character which always plays so I am beginning to wonder if he was given a script or just filmed and told to react as normal. Finally - humour. This reminds me of the 'Python (I think) quote about Shakespere of his 'comedies' - If he had meant it to be humorous he would have put a joke in it. Well I didn't see one. Don't waste your time - I did because I was watching it with a friend and kept hoping that it was going to get better. It didn't. 
 This must have been an embarrassment to every member of the entirely African-American cast. Every derogatory disparaging stereotype of the black American community is featured prominently. I won't reinforce the insults by listing them here except to mention chickens watermelons and dice. One good song by Ethel Waters (and a couple of bad ones) and the fantastic singing and dancing talents of 8-year-old Sammy Davis bring the total up to something below 1 on the IMDb scale. 
 What this movie fails from answering is how wrong this war is (and most US wars recently made only to get some oil). How many innocent civilian casualties there has been how many lives perished and how blatantly stupid the perpetrators are. So let me ask you - if American soldier kills women and children apart from enemy its OK but if government accidentally kills their own forces by deadly chemicals while killing many civilians as well it is not? Your logic fails gentleman. I'll give it 5 for the solid performance and 1 to everything else 3 in total. 
 A call-girl witnesses a murder and becomes the killer's next target. Director Brian De Palma is really on a pretentious roll here: his camera swoops around corners in a museum (after lingering a long time over a painting of an ape) divvies up into split screen for arty purposes practically gives away his plot with a sequence (again in split screen) where two characters are both watching a TV program about transsexuals and stages his (first) finale during a thunderous rainstorm. Dressed To Kill is exhausting primarily because it asks us to swallow so much and gives back nothing substantial. Much of the acting (with the exception of young Keith Gordon) is mediocre and the (second) finale is a rip-off of De Palma's own Carrie --not to mention Psycho . The explanation of the dirty deeds plays like a spoof of Hitchcock not an homage. Stylish in a steely cold way the end results are distinctly half-baked. ** from **** 
 I wish I could give this movie a zero or even lower because sadly that's what it deserves. I honestly never walk out of a movie but this one was so dreadfully awful that I couldn't stand another minute of it. Please please please- for the sake of mankind- skip this movie. If you want a hot lesbian movie that you can really delve into this isn't it. It has unattractive unappealing leads choppy structure ridiculous dialog and it is absolutely unconvincing in every imaginable way. On an absolutely basic level it fails to entertain. Everything about Mango Kiss is so stagey it is WORSE than any student film I have seen. As if that weren't enough the entire movie relies on constant (and I mean CONSTANT) voice over narration. The script writer may as well have written a novel because they insisted on TELLING everything instead of SHOWING it. We are just supposed to assume that Lou and Sassafras are the best of friends and have a special connection even though there is no character development to illustrate this. Also this film continues to introduce to new characters after the first five minutes and not in a natural way but in a freeze-frame of the characters with their name written over the screen. There is no introduction no development of any of the characters. We don't really get to know any of them. This is the most amateur movie I have ever seen. I am a gay woman who watched this film with my roommate (another gay woman) and we both found this movie to be a depressing representation of queer cinema. I am beginning to think that lesbian and gay movies are a lot like Christian rock - it doesn't matter how atrocious it is people will still flock to it and champion it no matter how poor the quality is. Please don't rent this!! Instead let's encourage the production of QUALITY gay and lesbian movies by renting But I'm a Cheerleader or Fire or Heavenly Creatures instead of swallowing whatever mindless tripe they aim at the gay community (i.e. Queer as Folk). 
 If there were a movie that deserved a 0 out of 10 this would be it. 'House of the Dead' redefines the term bad movie . Other bad movies such as 'When A Stranger Calls' or 'Premonition' will actually look much better when compared to 'House of the Dead'. The basic plot of House of the Dead is a group of twenty-somethings travel to a remote island to attend the rave of the century . When they get there they only find some tents a bar a stage and some bloody t-shirts. They decide to stay anyway and they are soon attacked by zombies. There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie. It is not entertaining. Instead it is painful to watch because of how terrible it is. The acting is unbelievably bad. In a DVD interview one of the actors claimed that Uwe Boll the director is not afraid to tell someone when they are doing a good job or a bad job in a scene. This is a blatant lie. The script appears to have been written by an 11-year-old who decided to include a scene of someone throwing up on a girl's chest and to include the hilarious line it smells like someone farted out here. The characters have no personality or depth and they do some of the most moronic things ever seen in a horror movie. Somewhere along the way the characters also magically transform into a SWAT team to take down the zombies. It's like they don't even have to aim their guns and they automatically shoot the zombies in the head. The scariest thing by far about this movie is the directing. There is something wrong with Uwe Boll. Boll's camera work is astonishingly disjointed. His pans to zombies running through the forest are more silly than menacing. Worse yet Boll actually thought it would be a good idea to include small bits of footage from the House of the Dead video game into the movie. Quite often and at the most random times you will suddenly see an animated zombie getting shot. It makes no sense. No one in their right mind would think that was a good idea. It's like Boll wants to remind us repeatedly that this movie is supposed to be based on the video game. Uwe Boll also decided it would be cool to include slow motion 360 degree rotating shots during the action scenes a la 'The Matrix'. Unfortunately he does it way too often and each shot is nauseating. The soundtrack to this movie also boggles the mind. Most action scenes are accompanied by loud rap track. This also adds to the ensuing headaches caused by the atrocious 'House of the Dead'. 'House of the Dead' isn't bad because it's based on a video game. In fact it has very little to do with the video game. It also does not fit into the category of 'so bad that it's good'. It does however fit into the category of 'so bad that it's painful'. This movie just plain sucks. Uwe Boll should never be let anywhere near another movie set. Even his presence will curse a production. To all the directors out there: whenever one of your movies gets a bad review all you have to do is remember that you didn't make 'House of the Dead' and you will feel much better. I will never get those 90 minutes of my life back. To sum it up words really cannot describe just how bad this movie is. Everyone involved in the production of this film especially Uwe Boll should be ashamed of themselves. Although what I have said may make 'House of the Dead' sound funny it really isn't. Nothing about it is funny. Avoid this at all costs. 
 As far as films go this is likable enough. Entertaining characters good dialogue interesting enough story. I would have really quite liked it had I not been irritated immensely whilst watching at the utter disrespect it shows the city it is set in. Glasgow. In Scotland. Yet every character is English (save for Sean's girlfriend who is Dutch). Scottish accents are heard only fleetingly in menial jobs & roles. As a Scottish woman (& as a viewer who likes her real life films to be a bit more like real life) I really don't think it would have hurt to use any one of the countless talented Scottish actors...or at least got English ones who could toss together a decent accent! The futile attempt at using the word wee a few times did nothing but to further the insult. 
 I don't like Sean Penn's directing very much and this early work The Indian Runner is no exception. The movie has no core it's colored with a kind of redneck anti-authoritarian tweeness that in all honesty taints most of Penn's work his latest work even more so than the earlier. Frank Miller Robert Rodriguez Clint Eastwood Sean Penn the whole lot seem to produce such fundamentally banal product ostensibly in some allegiance to honesty but ending up being for the most part glorified pro wrestling matches and moralistic almost as if Hallmark cards had developed a line of Hell's Angels greetings and make me long for the days of Deliverance which is a fine movie. Viggo Mortensen's acting is much much more believable here than that ridiculous Eastern Promises thing he did with Cronenberg and that's about it. The movie is dead meaningless and seems to be an exercise a series of techniques more than a story. Kudos for Charles Bronson however who proves he can act. And I wanted more of Sandy Dennis' character. A lousy 3 out of 10 for this The Indian Runner crap. 
 The only reason I elected to give this flick a shot was due to the presence of Oscar winner Ernest Borgnine. All I can say is it was the greatest waste of a good actor ever put to film. As far as I could tell Borgnine was the ONLY actor in it. The other performances were so uniformly terrible I am amazed a studio would actually pay the performers to appear. Couple this level of talent in the acting department with a story so plodding and insipid that I thought my eyes were going to start bleeding by the time the credits rolled and you have a perfect cinematic disaster. Obviously the movie was made to appeal to an audience of children and to its credit it was better than most of the original programing on the Disney Channel and similar kid-focused networks. But honestly that is not saying much. 
 I was fully amped up to see this film. I had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in New Zealand. I shouldn't have built myself up so much because it was so disappointing and is without a doubt Clark's worst film There is so much wrong with this film. First off some of the acting is great in particular Nick Stahl as 'The Bully' and the girl with the curly brown hair (I can't recall her name) but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly unbelievable especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He's a veteran of Clark's films now and he was so brilliant in 'Kids' but in 'Bully' he invests his lines with such solemnity as to turn his scenes into a parody virtually. The screenplay felt like it had been written by a first year film student. No sorry a high school student...one who has never seen a movie before. And I couldn't fathom Clark's intentions. Was he trying to point out the meaningless of these kids' existence? It sure as hell didn't stop him getting in a damn good perv. I'm no prude but I didn't need to see teenage breasts and buttocks every 5 minutes. I still maintain that Clark's best film is 'Another Day in Paradise'. It's fantastic and I don't think he'll ever top it. 
 This is the worst film I have ever seen.I was watching this film with some friends and after 40 minutes we had enough. The plot was bad and there wasn't a single likeable character.I could get more entertainment watching static. I gave this movie a 1 only because the scale didn't go into negative numbers. Avoid this movie at all costs. 
 Now I like sci-fi cartoons. However when Robotboy appeared in Canada in late 2006 I watched the premiere and was inevitably appalled. The characters are generic and stereotypical (Do they REALLY need to make an African-American man wear tiger-stripe print clothing and speak in a Jamacian accent? WHY are all the Asian characters vibrant yellow and squinting? Does the mother HAVE to have big thighs and chest and constantly complain?) to the point where things become unrealistic predictable gross and sometimes disturbing. There are heavy similarities to even stabs at Astro Boy. Allow me to explain (dub names for the young): Robotboy/Astro Kamikaze/Tenma Constantine/Shadow Gus/Abercrombie Tommy/Alejo Lola/Zoran+Kennedy Moshimo/O'Shay and it so on. Brief resemblances to My Life As A Teenage Robot Star Wars Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Kamen Riders Sailor Moon and co. are afoot. Not to mention the abundant racial/gender stereotyping. Don't even get me started on the innuendos. I'll just say they're hidden and quite dirty. But seriously. Don't even try watching this. Especially if you like Astro Boy. 
 If the only sex you've ever had is with a farm animal then the tag line for this movie is probably still misleading. This is by far one of the most boring movies I've had the pleasure to try and watch lately. I found the DVD lying around at my friend's house and I made the sad mistake of not burning it. I am unable to tell any details without spoiling the movie because there are only about 5 details to this movie. Just try to imagine someone making a movie about things on c-span only the fictional movie is 10 times less interesting than the most boring debate on c-span. I think there is a conspiracy somewhere in this movie but I was unable to tell exactly what it was after I gouched my eyeballs out and threw them at Richard Gere. 
 This movie was pretty bad. Sci-fi is usually my favorite channel so I watch all the original movies that play on it. I really don't know if this movie can be called original. Starting a zoo/theme park on a remote island sounds pretty familiar. What was it oh yeah Jurassic Park. But this has Sabertooth tigers instead. The movie starts out with a few stereotypical college kids on an island doing some kind of treasure hunt. One of them ends up dieing a rather gruesome death with some of the worst special effects I've seen. The blood looked a lot like ketchup. Also at the beginning there is a scientist who wants to make as many saber tooth tigers as possible for people to enjoy. 3 of them have already escaped and are going around eating the tourists or the people invited to the island to see the tigers first hand. Again sound like Jurassic Park. Probably the coolest thing was the 1000lb saber tooth who crawled around on his front legs killing the mad scientist with a tooth statue of sorts that somehow shrinks and goes through the guys neck. Funniest death I've seen on TV. The acting is extremely cheesy the special effects are horrible. The CG tigers could almost pass for clay models and even some of the sounds were off. For instance when one of the college students is trying to escape he uses an ax to break down a door the ax goes into the door and about 2 seconds later you hear the sound. This movie was pretty bad. The cheesy deaths were quite funny though. 
 Every year I watch hundreds of films including many low budget amateurish straight-to-DVD abominations that nobody in their right mind would ever want to see. I have seen thousands of films in my time many excellent many forgettable. Zombie Nation I will remember forever as one of the most hopelessly laughable 'horror' films I have ever seen ? in fact I still haven't recovered from the experience of watching it. The day after it seems like some kind of weird dream. Did I really see what I thought I saw? Why do the police work out of a warehouse? Did the voodoo priestesses really recommend that the 'zombies' eat cheeseburgers? Is it safe? Is it safe? Is it safe? I wouldn't recommend Zombie Nation if you want to see a 'good' film and neither would I recommend it as 'so bad its good'. However if you are entertained by the prospect of watching probably the most indefensibly abysmal film ever ? this is for you. Now whenever anyone asks me what the worst film I have ever seen is I will say Zombie Nation. Seriously ? I think it's a greater crime to make a boring film than a bad one and Ulli Lommel deserves credit for producing a film that actually stuns you with its ineptitude. He really is the Ed Wood Jr. of the digital age and I for one can't wait to see if he makes another film as consistently ridiculous as this one. 
 ...and you can look at that statement in different ways by the way. First of all it's a mess because of all the gruesome and extremely violent scenes. Your wildest imagination doesn't even come close to some of the explicitly shown scenes here. Entire parts of this movie are just plain sick disgusting offensive brutal and they bring you close to puking your guts out. Now I love horror movies and I am very 'pro-violence' but I do think that it has to lead somewhere !! Is that too much to ask ? Cradle of Fear is just a series of utterly sick and twisted thoughts. The movie contains out of four separate chapters connected by a wraparound story. This results in endless showing of torture murder and sickness only to find out that the victims have something in common. Not very informative if you ask me. And yet - it has to be said - the basic plot idea surely HAS potential. It's about a cannibalistic hypnotist who made a deal with the devil himself to avenge himself and cause misery and death to everyone who was involved in his trial. Personally I think that is an interesting topic so they should have focused on that a little more instead of wanting to create the most disgusting movie ever. Secondly the whole production of this movie was a mess. They didn't have much of a budget and they spent it all on fake blood and guts...Tons of it !! The acting performances are a joke and some of the worst I've ever seen. Any other special effects besides the make-up looks very amateurish ( Like that attempt to a realistic car crash for example ). There's no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere...not even an attempt to build up one. Cradle of Fear is a failure and a missed opportunity to say the least. With the presence of death-metal icon Danni Filth ( from the band Cradle of filth..get the link ? ) this movie is obviously only meant for the eyes of twisted teenagers who try to be controversial. Troubled girls and boys who take pleasure in worrying their parents by watching crap like this. And then people keep complaining that the amount of suicides and juvenile delinquency is increasing...Bah. I can imagine that this movie can cause a lot of damage when you're easily influenced or dispose of an unstable mind. For every self-respecting horror fan this movie is an insult. 
 I read the book Celestine Prophecy and was looking forward to seeing the movie. Be advised that the movie is loosely based on the book. Many of the book's most interesting points do not even come out in the movie. It is a B movie at best. Many events characters how the character interact and meet in the book are simply changed or do not occur. The flow of events that in the book are very smooth are choppy and fed to the view as though you a child. The character development is very poor. Personnallities of the characters differ from those in the book. The direction is similar to a B horror flick. I understand that it would take six hours in film to present all that is in the book but they screen play base missed many points. The casting was very good. 
 As with many other pop-culture franchise series this line just didn't know when to quit. Instead of leaving things as they were perfectly ended they went on to generate this; the first installment of this franchise to fall sorely short of the mark. This movie should never have happened. It was not intended for there to have been a fourth movie in this line and it sure shows. The premise is idiotic and the portrayals were the same. After the wonderful experience which was The Omen this was a major disappointment which stank of 70's cheese and horrible acting. It was reminiscent of the Amityville Horror in those aspects and left a terrible lingering stench long after it was over. It rates a 1.4/10 from... the Fiend :. 
 The Ladies Man is a funny movie. There's not much thought behind it but what do you expect from an SNL movie? It's actually better than most SNL movies (i.e. Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both very funny. Chris Parnell was also funny in his short scene (one of the funnier ones in the movie). Other than that the rest of the cast is average and is just there to support Meadows. I've definitely seen funnier movies but I've seen dumber ones too. Again it's not exactly a deep movie but it's good for a few laughs. It was funnier as a skit though. But still if you're looking for a pretty funny movie I'd recommend this one. Just don't think about it too much or you'll hate it. Rating: 6/10 
 this could be one of the worse movies i've ever seen. i don't see how could this ever be described as a horror movie or even a thriller? its more like a lumbering drama. the scary music is EXCELLENT but since there weren't any scary situations the director thought it would be a good idea to use it for everyday activities like taking a dump or walking down stairs. the movie had so much potential. they had beautiful cinematography (sp?) and interesting characters but it seemed as if the writers assumed you already knew them. they would undergo peculiar activities without explanation or even a clue at what they meant. this is simply one of those movies that says its about one thing and it something totally different. 
 Reed Diamond plays a man suffering from amnesia who's been in a mental asylum for over a decade after he was found wondering the back roads with blood on his hands. The doctors want to test out an experimental new drug that'll return his lost memories if it works. But when the drugs give him hallucinations of a demon he chooses to escape instead. While outside he befriends a young boy whose stepfather (Greg Grunberg) mistreats his mother won't let her near the darkroom in his basement & acts suspicious in general. While the general 'mystery' of the film is a tad easy to identify way before it's revealed I found Mr. Diamond's acting to be enthralling enough to keep my attention throughout. (In the interest of full disclosure I've been a huge fan of his since Homicide and his brief but extremely pivotal role in The Shield up through Journeyman & Dollhouse) Not a great film nor a good one but serviceable enough. Although I did like it better than the previous films that I've seen from Director/writer Michael Hurst (Room 6 Pumkinhead 4 Mansquito) Eye Candy: one fleeting pair of boobs in a hallucination My Grade: C- 
 And the Oscar for the most under-rated classic horror actor goes to - Dwight Frye. Seriously his name should be stated with the same awe as Karloff Lugosi and Price and this movie proves it. His character Herman was one of the 2 reasons I can give to watch this movie. Dwight gave this somewhat more than slightly disturbed misfit a lovable yet creepy demeanor that led you hoping for a larger role the entire movie. The other reason is the comic relief of M. Eburne. Being in the medical profession myself I have to give kudos to the expert performance of a self-pity prone hypochondriac. Though other medical mistakes did give a brief chuckle especially when the good doctor samples his fellow physicians medication... Well continue giving it to her Unfortunately these 2 outstanding performances could not keep me awake through 3 attempts of sitting through this unbearably slow movie. The plot is predictable with only few minor twists. The filming while pulling off a legitimate spooky atmosphere was more productive at making me yawn - yes you can use too much shadow. My recommendation - watch this once to see Frye and Eburne - but only when wide awake and with lots of caffeine. 
 This Lifetime style movie takes the middle aged divorcee victim who then finally fights back genre to new depths of cartoon-like absurdity. Here the 40 something stay-at-home ex-wife of a successful lawyer protagonist (daughter away at college) is starting a new life after her divorce helped by a female college friend in opening a new dress shop as a sort of franchise expansion deal. She has even started up a friendship with her attractive slightly younger perhaps landscape architect / gardener (who's black). But then horror of middle-aged women's horrors ANOTHER 20 something female she took on as a tenant to let a room to starts 'taking over her life. What this new younger woman threat really does is mildly flirt with the gardener and offer him a glass of wine that * gasp * really belonged to the divorcee!! She runs up the utility bills by not turning down the thermostat!! And backed up the toilet! And leaves old food gone bad in the refrigerator! And hangs her pieces of (African) artwork in the living room!! And so on. Well she may have killed the cat as well. Yeah ok the extent to which this one does these things is bad enough but its more than a little ridiculous especially as it turns into a campaign. The character reality is that any tiny part of this would drive this particular prissy woman insane. (So why did she rent the room -- and to horror of horrors a much younger woman?) Supposedly this increasingly arrogant (natch) younger woman has a mania for seizing control. And our brave 40 something must learn to fight back against this evil (and erotically hot looking of course) 20 something. But there's this problem. Anytime the 20 something starts to maybe get into trouble she uses her POWER -- and just flirts or has sex with some guy and escapes the consequences. (Well there actually is something to that capability of good looking 20 somethings. It just isn't * generally * used in quite this sort of way.) The premise is moved along by the device of the 20 something conning the divorcee into formalizing their room rental deal with a written lease produced by her. Of course the 40 something doesn't know about these things and the 20 something has had help. The lease actually gives the younger woman equal right to the whole house during the rental period with utilities thrown in at the fixed price. Even though an eviction proceeding is soon pending the 20 something soon gets a temporary restraining order against the older woman supposedly because she has been threatening the 20 something. You know the judge is sympathetic to all the woe-is-me of the sexy sweet young thing. Finally the 40 something's heroic battle back for THE HOUSE then begins. Woopie!! The only realistic or perceptive thing in this movie is how horrificly easy TRO's (or orders of protection) are for women to get on nothing more than her unsubstantiated say so -- although they are generally only this easy against men. They are sometimes just as unjustified and just as motivated to seize control of a home as it is here. Indeed girlfriends who have moved in with their boyfriends can often get them evicted from their own homes or condos on the basis of no proof whatsoever but only an unsubstantiated claim of threats and sometimes without even hearing his side. Even when there is a hearing it is routinely impossible to rebut claims of threats (to prove a negative) when the burden of proof is effectively on the accused rather than the accuser. (This is one of the only areas of American law where that is true -- and it's a signal outrage of feminist overreaching and the failure of any organized group to resist the steamroller.) Of course that's not likely to be the subject of any Lifetime movie in this lifetime. The absurd basic premise of this movie relies upon the explanation that the 20 something is psychotic and isn't taking her medicine. Even so it makes no sense. She isn't after the successful lawyer ex-husband though she does con his help (to the ex wife's fury) in her quest. She's after THE HOUSE (technically to drive the divorcee out of it during the period of the lease). This second younger woman is after ALL THAT'S LEFT after the divorce after affairs with other 20 somethings STOLE her husband!! (The ex-husband seems unattached and basically solicitous after his fling -- doesn't matter he still strayed!!!) The protagonist is good enough looking for her age. But her outlook attitude and focus is so small minded frumpy and utterly without imagination or life force that it's impossible to care about her. Well a core group of Lifetime fans care I guess judging by the average score the small number of raters gave it. (I kept watching it only because it was so extremely bad and cartoonish that it had a camp appeal. I couldn't resist seeing just how far they'd take it.) ** Spoiler ** (if such a thing is possible with this flick). Well here's a clue. The movie ends with the 20 something getting bailed out of jail by promising to listen to her 20 something male co-worker and sometimes lover and do whatever he says and let him take care of her (he means get her to keep taking her medicine) -- and then tricking him and returning to THE HOUSE. There she climbs the stairs with a knife demonicly stalking her nemesis 40 something who is taking a bath by candlelight secure in the thought that the younger woman is out of her life. There's a struggle -- and the 40 something mom wins -- by sticking the 20 something with a hypodermic needle full of anti-psychotic medicine she had found. She then begins stroking her mom like and the two women have a bonding female solidarity moment!!! How sweet. 
 First this film is not a thriller. Neither is it gripping taut. It might have been so based on the script but the direction's slow pace makes it difficult to get into. The plot itself is very interesting and ingenious. Unfortunately we only get a sense of *how* ingenious after the picture is over. That leaves us with over two hours of long sequences with music playing over them punctuated by some action scenes that don't grab the viewer and cunning vixen scenes that inject a little more overt intelligence. I wish this had been the fast-paced thriller the box promised. It would've been an outstanding film. Instead Spike Lee made it plod along through the end. 
 Shamefull as it may be this movie actually made it to the videomarket bringing shame on my proud country - any attempt to watch this movie without stopping or pausing will be a fruitless attempt. one cannot bear to see more than one hour of this then having either fallen asleep or visited the bathroom for puking. Note: if you haven't seen anything else from Denmark please remember this: some things were never meant to be - but still some idiot goes ahead and makes it anyway! 
 A lot of death happens in the wild. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure that out! But does it need to be the focus of a nature documentary? What is with this fascination with gruesome death? Do we really have to see an adult elephant torn to shreds by a pack of hungry lions? Or a cheetah grabbing a gazelle by the throat in slow motion no less! I thought this was going to be a family-friendly nature film! And why not have the courage to show the gruesome violence in the film's trailers? Were the filmmakers afraid of losing money? Then in typical comic relief fashion we get to see the magnificent Birds-of-Paradise perform mating rituals to the most annoying and stupid narration humanly possible. It was surreal! It's as if the filmmakers believed they were only addressing a roomful of First and Second graders on a school field trip! Wow! From the mean to the moronic in a heartbeat! If there are any future nature documentary filmmakers waiting in the wings reading this film review why not focus on: Animals actually copulating; giving birth; laying eggs; bathing; sleeping; cleaning each other; socializing; playing; emotional displays other than fear and anger; unusual behaviors like mouth brooding; migration; problem solving skills; culture (yes many animal species have what humans call culture); communication skills; parenting healing abilities etc. In other words stop focusing on violence or dumbing down beauty and why not be much more well-rounded - and focus on delight and inspiration instead? 
 I got this DVD well over 2 years ago and only decided to watch it yesterday. I don't know why it took me so long as I do like the Inspector Gadget show and even the new Gadget and the Gadgetinis. While it may have a bright color pallet and all the technical sophistication of a modern animated movie there are some old things missing that bog this Gadget right down the toilet. First of all the classic Inspector Gadget theme song and music is completely absent. The composer tries to compromise by doing a score that sounds similar but it's still just no good enough. The Gadget-mobile is now a talking car not a car that can turn into a van. Plus it looks a lot cuter and rounder instead of being plain cool. Penny no longer has her computer book and she and Brain hardly make an appearance at all. The plot is non-existent. There's something about a transformation formula and Doctor Claw using for some never revealed evil but that's all I got. What the deal was with the short/giant Italian guy I will never know. It had nothing to do with anything. And if the title is anything to go by his last case is wrapped up in no way whatsoever. And he stays on the force so why it's called 'last case' is a mystery also. I wasn't impressed at all. This is an affront to a great animated show that is strangely absent on DVD but don't let that prompt you into buying whatever Inspector Gadget DVDs you can. I sold this mere seconds after finally watching it. No kid will like or appreciate this and no fan of the old show with tolerate it. 
 The idea is nice. Bringing so many stars in one movie is great. But.... too many stories too short and lacking really any sense. No connection between the scenes. There were some 3-4 brilliant stories... but these were out of 18. The frame reminded me of All the invisible children - a movie which I liked a lot. Compared to it however Paris Je T'Aime lacks the intriguing short story which develops - starts and has its end. And it lacks the topic connecting all those - children. I do not find Paris enough of a topic to connect 18 short sketches together.Perhaps for people who know Paris it is interesting. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it... 
 Deep Shock plays out like a TV movie: a whole cast of commercial-quality actors a poorly designed creature to be the bad guy and a script that is more full of technical political jargon and importances than it knows what to do with. I checked out the movie because of the creature (I love to see what filmmakers have in mind for their designs in these cheaply made videos) and right off the bat I got disappointed because the creature on the box was not the one in the movie. The actors I expected because of the type of film it is (really quite generic and not thought out past a certain point). The music was typical not-thought-out action symphonic music. I liked the design of the computers and technical equipment along with the mini-sub design. The movie even flowed really well with guiding screens letting you know which set you're watching the story unfold in. But there isn't much of a story here anyways. This movie gets a 3/10 stars IMO. The boring search and destroy mission to blow up the North Pole and these creatures protecting it...kinda lame. Even lamer is the tagged-on love relationship between two of the characters that you don't see coming. Chalk this one up to being a movie which tries to get actors' careers off the bench and into a video. Don't bother. 
 I'm sure this was one of those WOAH! attractions in 1982 when Epcot opened but now it's just silly. The film's message is clich. The Circle-Vision is disorienting. And that awful song at the end is grating. And I really wish they'd install seats. After so much walking all you want to do is sit down for a few minutes. And when you hear there's a film to see it sounds pretty glamorous! You get entertained while sitting down right? WRONG! You're standing there for 18+ minutes leaning against a short little railing. Disney should make a newer Maelstrom like attraction to liven things up and replace this dull lackluster film. NOT FUN. Skip it. In fact skip Canada altogether unless you're eating there. Move directly to the United Kingdom. 
 Anyone who has watched Comedy Central around midnight in the past few years has probably seen ads for this movie. I first saw ads for this movie back in 2001. It looked like it could be funny but I wasn't about to call up the number on the television screen and order it without seeing the movie first. I figured I would wait until the movie was available to rent at Blockbuster. About a year and a half later I was at Tower Records and in the DVDS for less than $20 pile there was a copy of this movie. Seeing that the DVD was only $6.99 I decided to buy it. I got home put the disc in the DVD player and waited for the laughs to start...and I waited some more. The laughs never came. I'd have to agree with almost every other comment on this page when I say that this movie was horrible. Sick desperately tasteless and poorly written and directed THE UNDERGROUND COMEDY MOVIE is an atrocious piece of garbage and is in my opinion the worst movie of all time. No stars. 
 When I caught a glimpse of the title I thought are we going to get another try-hard hip slasher but actually I found 7eventy 5ive to be a mildly passable and almost 80s throwback after a tediously slow mid-section it picks up momentum for the final half-hour leading to it's outrageously tacky climax and downright cop out ending. It won't win awards for originality because it's as systematic as you can get and steals its thunder in the way of thrills (usual cheap jump scares) location (secluded mansion) and motivation from other films. The gleaming direction is by-the-book and the material is quite hackneyed with poorly realised red herrings within its elaborate plotting and flimsy script. Sometimes laughable but nonetheless I was entertained mainly due to its brutal and grisly acts of pulpy violence towards some rather obnoxiously annoying college students by a psychotic killer with a battle axe. The performances weren't bad in the shape of a spunky young cast however the characters they were portraying weren't particularly enticing. An always presentable Rutger Hauer shows up in a short supportive role as a grizzled detective. A slickly made but a shallow and forgettable addition to the fold. 
 In The Lost Son a private eye searching for a missing man stumbles upon a child prostitution ring. This film incorporates all of the worst stereotypes you could imagine in a worst-case scenario that exists only in the minds of Hollywood the press and AG John Asscrap. If you get a chance to see this you'd be better off getting lost yourself. 
 I simply cant understand why all these relics from the Ceausescu era refuse to let go. One can see clearly how frustrated they were during the commie censorship that forbade them so many things to show in their movies and now they imagine its dunno what big deal of artsy-fartsy freedom so fill the screen with people defecating urinating vomiting swearing and any other kinds of hideousness imaginable. THIS IS NOT CINEMA FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS! This is simply visual perversion. Forget about Bunuels Chien Andalou about David Lynch about Forman and neorealism and other movie makers who were able to work with an aesthetics of ugliness. THOSE people were mastering their jobs - well you Don't! Do us a favor all you Daneliucs and Nicolaescus and Saizescus and Muresans and Marinescus and Margineanus and other obsolete old-timers and leave us alone! Its bit time to see some Romanian MOVIES on screen enough with your immature terribilisms! You are not directors you are ILLITERATE!!! 
 Released in 1965 but clearly shot years earlier this is an inept little crime melodrama with some inept sexploitation up front. As usual for grindhouse flicks of era there's a fair amount of undressing and dressing for no reason complemented by lousy music annoying narration and awkward editing. The coffee shop scene lays the excruciating groundwork as we chop back and forth between characters to avoid actually seeing them speak their lines. All we get are reaction shots to the off-screen character's voice! 50s-pretty Misty Ayers strips to her French-cut panties a couple of times before the action gets started. She's accompanied continuously by what is apparently stock music from romantic to western to mother-does-the-dishes mixed randomly to produce among other things the most thrilling cigarette lighting ever captured on film. Watch as he taps it! Watch as he strikes the match! Will he inhale or will he be captured by Apaches? Only time will tell!! The film tells the sordid tale of how Sally gets tricked into working in a whorehouse falls for a dope and can't escape. For some reason we're treated to some of the most bored and boring hookers ever committed to film literally doing their nails or knitting rather than entertaining the clientle. Some stupendously lame comedy (boozy dame accidentally drinks milk! Har dee har!) and silent film acting doesn't help. This is one of the worst feature films I've ever seen even on the Something Weird Video marquee. It's really more of a film curiosity for those interested in the history of cinema--very bad cinema. 
 I have seen a lot of stupid movies in my life a lot but this is without a doubt the worst one ever! I usually like dumb movies if they are somewhat entertaining but I can't even think of one good thing about this movie. I like Teen Witch for Heaven's sake. But S.I.C.K. has horrible acting lame porn music throughout the whole thing and even the sex scenes sucked! I would have to compare the lameness of this movie to the likes of Twin Dragons Puppet Master vs the Demonic Toys or even a Very Brady Sequel . Although this is by far worse then any of those. I beg you don't even waste your time. Believe me its 2 hours you'll never get back. 
 While I totally disagree with one reviewer who described Charley Chase as unfunny in this film he certainly is. It's a shame as I suspect the other reviewer must have only seen a few Charley Chase duds and assumed the guy wasn't funny. Films like MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE and WHAT PRICE GOOFY? are very good Chase films so he COULD be really funny given good material. Unfortunately in this film he's given absolutely nothing. Even the inclusion of the usually good Oliver Hardy as a foil isn't any help because the basic premise (boy wants to marry girl but girl's father thinks the boy is a wuss) and the gags are so poor. It's a shame as I really wanted to love this film but couldn't. By the way for those used to the look for Charley from the mid-1920s on you'll be pretty surprised as Chase sports no glasses or mustache--and looks very little like you'd expect. 
 I can't figure out how anyone can get a budget for a movie this bad. It's like the TV station are desperate for anything anything at all. They're buried underneath a bunch of snow the electricity constantly flashes on and off yet magically there is a background light that stays constant. Where does all this (fake) light come from? That and all that stupid bickering between the characters. They seem to be more interested in complaining to each other than trying to invent ways to survive. It tries to create that feel of emergency and people helping. But because it's such bad directing and acting you will not your Florence Nightingale fix with this flick sorry. I'm joining the negative feedback and I concur that this is one of the worst movies ever. 
 I got this movie out of Blockbuster in one of those racks were you can get like 5 movies for 20 bucks. I'd have to say I got my money's worth on this one. I had expected horrible dialogue crappy monsters and shaky cameras. Well as Meatloaf said two outta three ain't bad. The acting is bad though not as bad as some movies I've seen. Or maybe I've watched so many low budget movies recently I've lost perspective. There are some bits were the acting is downright terrible but for the most part it's of at least High School Play level. The CG for the Sasquatch in this movie is probably the second-worst part. The first thing I thought when I saw it (and I noticed another reviewer agreed with me) was that a man in an ape suit would have been better. Clunky stop-motion animation would have looked better. So you may be asking why I call the CG the second-worst part. That's because the very worst part of the movie is the sound effects. They are loud annoying and constant. I've been camping I know what insects sound like in the woods at night and while they can be loud they're not deafening like the cacophony in this movie. Usually when the background sounds drown out the movie's dialogue it's a bad thing but from what I caught of the dialogue of this film I wasn't missing much. The action was infrequent and boring. The tension was non-existent as was any sense of empathy with the characters. Speaking of the characters they were all cookie-cutter and bland. The only mildly engaging byplay was between...actually I can't think of anything. There was a line or two that made me crack a wan smile but that was about it. The cinematography was decent a step or two above what you'd normally see in a movie like this. However it still had that home movie quality to it that you get with movies made on pocket change and a prayer. If you're like me and get a kick out of shoestring budget genre flicks and you see this one in the dollar bin think about grabbing it. Otherwise stay away at all costs. 
 This little show is obviously some stupid little prequel/spin off of the original series. Compared to the live action series this show is utter crap. The live action show had intelligent jokes and story lines. While the animated series is basically a toned down bittersweet version for younger viewers to digest but i think maybe kids deteste this crap. The storyline in every episode is basically just Sabrina has some stupid and pointless dillemma and she uses magic to fix it. Thats basiclly the idea every episode. The most bizarre episode was when Sabrina uses magic to become Gem and Gem to become Sabrina. So then Gem becomes a witch and hypnotizes harvery to become her slave. This then leads to a bizarre yet rather interesting scene were Gem says just adore me for now and harvey get down on his hands and knees and starts kissing her feet like shes a god. (which is quite right since he's her mind control slave) But this stupid spin-off is not worth the time or the effort. 
 What was an exciting and fairly original series by Fox has degraded down to meandering tripe. During the first season Dark Angel was on my weekly must see list and not just because of Jessica Alba. Unfortunately the powers-that-be over at Fox decided that they needed to fine-tune the plotline. Within 3 episodes of the season opener they had totally lost me as a viewer (not even to see Jessica Alba!). I found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish. The new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin. On one of the second season episodes they even had Max sleeping and dreaming - where the first season stated she biologically couldn't sleep. The moral of the story (the one that Hollywood never gets): If it works don't screw with it! azjazz 
 OK a slasher movie. a very very stupid slasher movie. We got your stereotypical teenagers in a house thing going. We got a FBI agent that's seen Dirty Harry one time too many. So what's the secret....punks? We got about 4 different little camera shots and scene that make no sense at all. Hey man i'm fixing the sprinklers ((that guy was my favorite part of the movie)) Suddenly there's a preacher tied up on a couch watching home movies he gets killed. they follow the killer into the middle of nowhere with no cops. suddenly she's in a church wearing a wedding dress. i swear this is the stupidest slasher movie i've ever seen. 
 here was no effort put into Valentine to prevent it from being just another teenage slasher film a sub-genre of horror films of which we have seen entirely too many over the last decade or so. I've heard a lot of people complaining that the film rips off several previous horror movies including everything from Halloween to Prom Night to Carrie and as much as I hate to be redundant the rip off is so blatant that it is impossible not to say anything. The punch bowl over poor Jeremy's head early in the film is so obviously taken from Carrie that they may as well have just said it right in the movie (`Hey everyone this is the director and the following is my Carrie-rip-off scene. Enjoy!'). But that's just a suggestion. (spoilers) The film is structured piece by piece exactly the same way that every other goofy teen thriller is structured. We get to know some girl briefly at the beginning she gets killed people wonder in the old oh-but-that-stuff-only-happens-to-other-people tone and then THEY start to get killed. The problem here is that the director and the writers clearly and honestly want to keep the film mysterious and suspenseful but they have no idea how to do it. Take Jason for example. Here is this hopelessly arrogant guy who is so full of himself and bad with women that he divides the check on a date according to what each person had and as one of the first characters seen in the film after the brief history lesson about how bad poor Jeremy was treated he is assumed to carry some significance. Besides that and more importantly he has the same initials as the little boy that all the girls terrorized in sixth grade and the same initials that are signed at the bottom of all of those vicious Valentine's Day cards. It is not uncommon for the audience to be deliberately and sometimes successfully misled by the behavior of one or more characters that appear to be prime suspects and Jason is a perfect example of the effort but not such a good example of a successful effort. Sure I thought for a while that he might very well be the killer but that's not the point. We know from early on that he is terrible with women which links him to the little boy at the beginning of the film but then in the middle of the film he appears at a party smiles flirtatiously at two of the main girls and then gives them a hateful look and walks away disappearing from the party and from the movie with no explanation. We already know he is a cardboard character but his role in the film was so poorly thought out that they just took him out altogether when they were done with him. On the positive side the killer's true identity was in fact made difficult to predict in at least one subtle way which was also unfortunately yet another rip-off. Early in the film when Shelley stabs the killer in the leg with his own scalpel he makes no sound suggesting that the killer might be a female staying silent to prevent revealing herself as a female rather than a male as everyone suspects. But then for the rest of the film we just have this stolid relentless unstoppable killer with the emotionless mask and that gigantic butcher knife. Director Jamie Blanks (who with all due respect looks like he had some trouble with the girls himself in the sixth grade) mentions being influenced by Halloween. This is of course completely unnecessary because it's so obvious from how badly he plagiarizes the film. The only difference between the killer in Valentine and Michael Meyer's is that Michael's mask was so much more effective and he didn't have a problem with nosebleeds. This stuff is shameless. At the end there is a brief attempt to mislead us one more time as to who the killer is (complete with slow and drawn out `and-the-killer-is' mask removal) but then we see Adam's nose start to bleed as he holds Kate his often reluctant girlfriend and we know that he's been the killer all along. Nothing in the film hinted that he might be the killer until the final act and these unexplained nosebleeds were not exactly the cleverest way to identify the true killer at the end of the film. Valentine is not scary (I watched it in an empty house by myself after midnight and I have been afraid of the dark for as long as I can remember and even I wasn't scared) and the characters might be possible to care about if it weren't so obvious that they were just going to die. I remember being impressed by the theatrical previews (although the film was in and out of the theater's faster than Battlefield Earth) but the end result is the same old thing. 
 If you're looking to be either offended or amused or both you'll probably have to look elsewhere. LMOTP really isn't even very thought provoking beyond rehashing the usual silly clichs. At the end of the second episode I felt a little embarrassed that I actually sat through the contrived mess. Beyond the thinly veiled gimmicky premise thats attracted all the initial attention to it in the first place it's just another lame innocuous and anti-septic attempt at commentary and entertainment that the CBC typically excels at producing. And once the ZOMG MUSLIMS IN RURAL CANADA ROFLMAO!! hype wears out its welcome the show is likely to follow into the ether of cancellation because it's so shallow when judged on its merits alone. Unless you're obsessed with Muslim culture in the west and/or are easily amused by the most minute idiosyncrasies on the subject I really don't see how LMOTP is enjoyable beyond satisfying the curiosity that stemmed from the hype. Other shows have better addressed the issue of cultural/ethnic dichotomy in western multi-ethnic societies. LMOTP will never rank among them in entertainment or insight. 
 This third Pokemon movie is too abstract for younger kids to follow and too repetitious to entertain older kids. The message of the film-- about dealing with loss-- is subverted by the return of the young girl's father during the film's credits. Team Rocket provide some amusement but they're not really part of the small plot so they don't appear very often. 
 My one line summary should explain it all but I'll have a go at it. From the get-go this movie seemed like an overdone soap opera and that's about all I can comment on. There were a few interesting scenes such as the Big one that hit during the middle of the movie but wait what's that? The earthquake *gasp* wait a minute! That's Dante's Peak! Well parts of it butchered and slapped in. I can't believe how poorly this movie was done borrowing scenes from other much better films. One wonders what director thought that viewers are dumb enough to believe large wooded mountain-esque backdrops exist in downtown LA ala Dante's Peak. My advise forget the Bond Wanna-be Nash in this film and go for the real thing (again someone from Dante's Peak coincidentally.) 
 I couldn't believe my eyes when I watched Nuremberg yesterday on Dutch television. It starts very slowly the backgrounds of the Nuremberg trials become clear step by step the Germans have a funny English accent but then suddenly in the last few minutes of the first part of the series the audience gets to see the most shocking horrific footage I have ever seen. It is important that people get to see such footage (although I absolutely don't agree with people stating that there is no minimum age at which children can be exposed to this kind of material) but in this film it was completely ridiculous. It was purely meant to improve the impact of an ordinary TV series. It was meant to shock the audience which is very cheap and unbelievably easy. In stead of trying to move us with well-done scenes inspiring dialogue or interesting viewpoint's the audience is being tortured with horrible images of skin-and-bones camp inmates. It doesn't show any respect for the victims of the holocaust. I'm very angry. 
 How is it possible that no journalist or critic reminded us of the resemblance with that other better Flemish movie Congo Express (1986) ? There are also some characters in congo Express put together without having really a relation to each other: Jean (de Congolees) the workman the two taxi-drivers the street-singer Roger Guy Lucienne and Gilbert. Of course Tom Barman is a star and Luc Gubbels wasn't. That should not be a reason to pardon the flaws in the script (if there is a script) of Anyway the wind blows. The joke (the only one!) at the party about the ice in the refrigerator is taken from that great Flemish movie De Witte (1934) where De Witte is putting too much salt on the potatoes. Some accidents happen in the movie but there comes no explanation after. Tom Barman delivers us here a movie that is more like an experiment to watch at the television than a movie for the theatres. Another missed chance for Flemish Cinema. 
 Regarded by many critics as one of the biggest stinkers of all time (certainly the biggest stinker of director Brian De Palma's career). Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) is a smug rich boy whose life goes to pieces when he and his lover Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith) are involved in a hit-and-run. His story is chronicled by another smug guy reporter Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis). Well as I said in my summary... What is this movie supposed to be? It seems to combine comedy drama and satire but it sure doesn't add up to much. It's undermined by unimaginably loathsome one-dimensional characters who you'd never want to have the displeasure of meeting in real life. I'm no big fan of the novel (I started reading it once but couldn't finish it because it wasn't to my liking) but it's obvious to me that those who did / do enjoy the novel consider this film to be a complete travesty. I've never seen so many talented actors strive to hard to give a below-average movie some semblance of quality and fail. What a waste. The problems start with casting nice guy Tom Hanks in a role that is clearly supposed to be UNsympathetic. And the role of Peter Fallow in the novel was that of a Brit. Bruce Willis is badly BADLY miscast in the role. What was the thinking there. Alas not even Morgan Freeman can escape the film with his dignity intact being obliged to deliver a lame heavy-handed lecture on 'decency' after the climax. This movie ends up turning into an absurd farce. I liked the assemblage of talent; for that I will give it four out of ten but I'm sure some people will say a MUCH better movie could have been made from the source material. 
 Please avoid this movie at all costs. This is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. Most movies have at least one redeeming value. This has none. Totally horrible! 
 This movie does not rock as others have said. I found it really boring and silly. The story is about this metal high school kid who idolizes this really bad heavy metal singer. The singer dies but not before making one last album that is to be played over the radio at of course midnight on Halloween (which would actually make it November 1st a much less potent date to be sure). The kid gets a copy of the record and it contains secret hidden back-play messages. It also is the key that opens the door so that the really bad metal singer can return to bring havoc and death to the world. The first part of this film is not a horror film at all but rather an After School Special. We see the metal kid (the outsider) tormented over and over by the popular kids. And he fails to learn the most important lesson in high school movies: When the cool kids who bully you suddenly invite you to a party DON'T GO! It is a trap. Especially if it is a pool party. Anybody surprised when he ends up in the water?? It was such an After School Special that I kept waiting for Melissa Sue Anderson to show up and teach Jody Foster a lesson. So back to the horror part of the film. So this metal kid gets some powers and instead of using them to kill the bully boys (which would have made much more sense) he freaks out and tries to protect all of the bully boys and girls from harm. What? A sensitive hero? What fun is that in a horror movie? Thank goodness Carrie White did not follow this lesson. He actually tries to PREVENT having the music played at the Halloween Dance the very music that could unleash a power to kill all the kids who had been mean to him. If it were me I would have put that music on and pronto. The rest of the movie is about this metal kid going around town trying to kill the horrible metal star he idolized. Why not partner with him and REALLY do some damage. Why you ask? It seems he is in love with one of the popular girls and does not want her hurt..more appropriate for a Molly Ringwald film. Is this a horror film or an episode of Beauty and the Beast? The movie just goes on and on at this point with no scares horror or anything worth watching. If you went to high school in the late 80s like I did this movie is fun to have a little flashback to fashions and big hair but that is it for this film. Skip it and stay home and just listen to some KISS. 
 As I sat in front of the TV watching this movie I thought Oh what Alfred Hitchcock or even Brian DePalma could have done with this! Chances are you will too. It does start out intrigueing. A British park ranger living in Los Angeles (Collin Firth) marries a pretty demure brunette woman (Lisa Zane) whom he met in a park only a short time ago. Then one day she dissappears. The police are unable to find any documentation that she ever existed and Firth conducts his own search. So far so good. Just as he's about to give up he turns to his womanizing best friend (Billy Zane) and they stumble onto her former life in L.A.'s sordid underground of drugs nightclubs and ametuer filmmaking and then to her history of mental instability. At that point Firth's life is in danger and the film falls apart. None of the characters from Lisa Zane's past are remotely interesting. The film moves slowly and there's very little action. There is a subplot regarding missing drug money but it's just a throwaway. No chases no cliffhanging sequences and no suspense. Just some dull beatings and a lot of chat by boring characters. One thing worth noting Lisa Zane and Billy Zane are brother and sister but they never appear in a scene together. By the end of the movie you're torn between wondering what might have been and trying to stay awake. 
 This movie could have been great(cause its got a somewhat fascinating premise) but it never rises above sheer caricature. The acting is severely flawed and there were moments where i cringed so severely that i thought i was going to fall of my seat in the theater. Never and I mean never Watch this godawfull piece of .... Danish cinema has been getting a lot of good pr the recent years but if this piece of .... crosses the border I'm afraid nobody sane will ever want to rent a danish movie. This movie is the reason why i chose to register here. I really felt i needed to steer people away from this piece of .... my sympathies go out to the people who already went to the cinema to watch this 
 After just finishing the book the same day I watched the movie I knew what was supposed to happen. I had high expectations of the movie because of the rating. The only reason I give this movie a 2 out of 10 stars is that it was alright trying to be a movie. I have a couple main points for not liking this movie. ********** SPOILERS ********** 1. The casting. Jack Nicholson barely fits into Jack Torrence's character. Also I would have NEVER picked Shelly Duvall for Wendy. I pictured Wendy much differently. I can see why they picked Jack Nicholson though the grin the pointy eyebrows but he's not supposed to really look 'evil'. He's supposed to look normal and he turns evil. Also they make one of the worst movie couples. Danny was alright he needed more life though. He acted way to droney. 2. The screenplay. They cut out so many things that were in the book and added things. Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to in the movie were either deleted changed or handled wrongly. Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to seeing (the hedge animals the roque mallet the elevator) were not in the movie and it was 2 and half hours!! I was extremely irritated. 3. The Ending. The ending was changed completly Halorann died Jack froze to death Wendy never got hurt...The Overlook didn't blow up. The Ending was so cool in the book and the movie messed it up so horribly I was apalled. Hallorann was never supposed to die but Jack killed him with an ax. If they wanted to kill him at least have Jack use a roque mallet. You never even saw a roque mallet during the whole movie. There are other things that I didn't like about the movie but there are things that were all right. The camera angels were cool the blood coming out of the elevator (didn't happen in the book) was cool but maybe I was too irritated that the movie didn't go with the book to try to be scared at all. I reccomend reading the book before you see this movie. I applaud Stephen King for actually agreeing to sign a contract to not dis Stanley Kubrik any more. I would never have done that I would have taken all the rights I could get to yell at him all day. I can't wait to see the 6 hour version at least it has the hedge animals. Rating: 2/10 
 Miraculously this is actually quite watchable. I mean it's bad. It's really bad. But whereas the original was so-bad-it's-ruining-my-life bad this is so-bad-it's-mildly-entertaining bad. Right that's enough faint praise. Production values are rotten across the board the acting is excruciating and the Romero-wannabe satire can't make its mind up which side of the ecology fence it's mocking. Internal logic takes a back seat to heads propelling themselves out of fridges virus incubation times fluctuating as the 'plot' requires bullets working against the zombies or not zombies having the power of speech or not. Gore is the draw obviously but the framework is so slapdash it's annoying. The dialogue sounds like it's been translated by the same computers that mangle instruction manuals and the scale of the zombie infestation is implied with none of the ingenuity of Romero's films. It's all topped off with a horrendous synth score. Absolute rubbish. 
 This piece of filth is virtually impossible to follow. The sound is crap the picture quality goes from bad to worse to good to bad again! Things happen for no apparent reason characters appear and disappear. Was the director suffering from a massive brain injury during its production? Poor film making aside the story is vile just sick evil sh*t If you like rape murder and self harm this is right up your alley. And if simulated scenes of murder are not enough you can enjoy clips of actual people being executed. I watched almost all of it but had to turn off after I seen someones brains blown out. Never before have I seen a film that left me feeling so ashamed and dirty. 
 The original Trancers is not by any means a great movie. It had massive plot holes and very little in the way of internal logic. However it was entertaining better done than most low-budget B-movies and could be surprisingly witty. Unfortunately Trancers II is none of these. Trancers II suffers from many of the same problems of most flop sequels. The plot is thin enough to see through and the writing is insipid. It seems that the people behind this movie felt that bringing the familiar faces of the first movie back would be enough and didn't bother with anything else. Not even veteran B-grade actors like Tim Thomerson and Jeffery Combs were able to drag this film out of the muck. A brief plot overview: Jack Deth (Thomerson) is a cop from the future who was sent to 1985 to save the ancestors of members of his government. Trancers II takes place six years after the events of the first Trancers. Jack Deth is married to Lena (Helen Hunt) the woman he met in the first movie and both live with Hap Ashby the man Deth was sent into the past to protect. It is discovered that the brother of Whistler (the bad guy from the first movie) has traveled back in time to create an army of Trancers people turned into mindless killing zombies to kill Ashby. Complicating Jack's mission is the fact that his first wife who had died long before Jack traveled to the past was also sent back to stop Whistler's brother and now Jack finds himself working with her. I have two real problems with this movie. One is that the method of creating Trancers in this movie is radically different from the methods used in the first movie. What makes it annoying is that in a rather poor example of Soviet Revisionism they act like it was always the technique. The other thing that annoys me is that the love triangle between Deth Lena and Alice Stilwell (Jack's first wife) is given very little screen time. This bothered me particularly because it was much more interesting than the actual plot of the movie. It felt like it was just something that was thrown in to fill space in the movie. Alice's character in particular seems very unconcerned with the fact that she is reunited with her husband only to find he's re-married making her either very shallow or very poorly written. The only reason I can think of for watching this movie is if you're interested in watching the entire Trancers series (currently totaling six movies). Otherwise even if you're a fan of the original Trancers stay away from this tepid sequel. 
 My nose is bent slightly out of shape as I write this. I had sent a previous comment on this film some weeks ago that has not yet appeared so I assume it was rejected even though it met all the usual guidelines. I found this film interesting for the first thirty minutes particularly the performance of Jordi Moll a veteran actor who has appeared in such major productions as Blow and The Alamo. Leonor Watling is also quite good. Unfortunately everything sinks eventually under the weight of a truly awful melodramatic script. There is also an abundance of gratuitous nudity that does nothing to advance the narrative or lend even an impressionistic nuance to what is otherwise a beautifully filmed piece of art. An actual day trip to the beach at Valencia would be much less arduous than having to encounter these fictional characters again anywhere anytime. 
 *McCabe and Mrs. Miller* takes place in the turn-of-the-century Pacific Northwest. Into a soggy muddy mining camp John McCabe (a hirsute Warren Beatty) comes barging full of cigar smoke and big ideas about building a proper saloon/whorehouse for the town replete with a trio of the sorriest whores in movie history. He also comes with an unearned reputation as a gunslinger: too shameful about this to blatantly advertise it but not exactly afraid to use it in order to assert alpha-male credentials amongst the locals. And thus he wrangles the boys into building his saloon at the rate of 15 cents an hour. It looks to be a rather sorry operation until Mrs. Miller (Julie Christie) shows up on a startling contraption that's half-railroad car half-automobile (where did Altman find that thing?). Mrs. Miller immediately takes on McCabe as a business partner with the aim of classing up the new joint with proper whores and an insistence that all visitors take a bath before entering. Noting that McCabe doesn't know how to add she also insists on handling the accounts. It's not clear what McCabe's function will be. The plot thickens when a pair of oily representatives from the mining company show up in town and offer McCabe to buy him out for five grand. McCabe tells them to buzz off -- he's holding out for fifteen thousand. The company finds negotiation distasteful so they hire a trio of assassins to simply kill McCabe . . . though how they think they can get away with murdering a man in broad daylight in the center of town is as unclear as McCabe's function in the whorehouse partnership. (Excusing this whopping plot hole on the grounds that the locals would be too cowed to talk doesn't cut the mustard when one considers that any reward-money offered by the local Marshal would be pretty tempting.) *McCabe and Mrs. Miller* purportedly classic Seventies cinema should be a lot better than it is. The movie tells a pretty good story; the main characters have the potential to be interesting. There are some striking scenes especially one involving what looks to be a 14-year-old stone-cold killer. But it's really really hard to enjoy a movie when you can hardly hear what anyone is saying and when you can hardly see what anyone is doing. Once again this director hijacks his own movie with sheer barnyard laziness and sloppiness. According to the trivia-sheet here on IMDb the movie's editor griped to Altman that the sound was muddy; Altman disagreed; and when everyone said the sound was muddy after the movie's release Altman blamed the editor. (Nice.) Along with the bad sound the movie has an atrocious look. Only Robert Altman can hire a world-class DP like Vilmos Zsigmond and make a movie that looks as if they sprayed the camera lenses with dirty dishwater. Reviewers here who praise the dark brown glow of this picture have GOT to be kidding me. The interiors are shot through what appears to be a dark scum. The exterior photography is even worse: it's as if Altman placed 500 fog machines behind the copious trees. During the climactic stretch when Beatty is dodging the assassins while the local church is on fire Altman insists on pretty much wholly obscuring the view with an animated snow-fall that reminds one of a Rankin-Bass Christmas special. Look -- I can't watch a movie under these conditions. Get back to me when you learn how to place boom mikes when you remove all that annoying Altman-esque overlapping dialog and when you wipe the lenses with some Windex or something. 3 stars out of 10. 
 Having seen the first ten episodes I must say this show sucks. What bothers me the most is that the show was shot in Canada. I know it's cheaper but they should have shot it in California so we could have had scenes in the desert. That would have been more true to the movie. The first scene where they are outside in another world is in the mountains with lots of pinetrees where it looks cold. That does'nt feel very Egyptian. What worked so well in the movie was that it felt like you were in the ancient Egypt. Here it feels like they're running around fighting aliens in a Canadian forrest. And it's so lame that appaerantly on other planets the fall comes as well. You can see leaves on the ground in the forrests that all look like forrests outside Vancouver. It just makes the show even more unbelievable and dumb. And then there is Richard Dean Anderson. He is no Kurt Russel. Sure he does a decent job and he tries to copy Russels performance a little bit but he is just not as cool as Russel. And not nearly as good an actor as Russel. And Russells way of playing O Neill well he was much more cynical. Andersons O Neil is way too soft. I liked it that Russels version just did'nt give a s*** and had no trouble detonating the bomb until the very end of the movie. Michael Shanks does a really good job as Jackson though taking over from James Spader. Teal'c is a really annoying character. He is Jaffa. Not a Jaffa. Just Jaffa. Aaaarrgh!! A former bodyguard of a pathetic Ra character seen only in the pilot and in one other episode so far. Teal'c speaks talks and acts like a robot. I've seen better acting from Jean Claude Van Damme. And the fact that Teal'c and the Ra character and the people they saved in the movie can speak English all of a sudden is also incredibly dumb. What made the aliens so scary in the movie was that they spoke an ancient language and were real monsters. As for the special effects they are really good in the pilot. But the very rare effects in the actual show are badly done and looks cheap. Especially a planet they visit with crystals. It's so obvious they walk around on a soundstage with a badly made painting in the background. It's an insult to us viewers that they made it look so cheap. Especially when they could have made it in front of a bluescreen with cgi backgrounds. The X-files had better effects when they aired their first episodes in 1993. That was 4 years before SG-1 started. And they did'nt have the apparent two million dollar budget per episode that SG-1 supposedly had. They must have spend all the money on catering. Because I don't see it on the screen. Incredibly boring and pointless show that could have been great if they had shot the show in Hollywood with a bigger budget and better writers and better characters. 
 I really wish that when making a comedy the people actually tried to make it funny. This is a film that you can sit through but nothing is special about it. After watching it you will say that it was alright. It was not boring to watch but gave the audience no jokes to laugh at. Entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than an o.k. story. This movie wanted to be Tootsie but instead it failed. I gave it a 1 out of 10. 
 I was looking forward to Kathryn Bigelow's movie with great anticipation after the endless hype and 6 Oscars which it was awarded. Unfortunately it really isn't a good movie. The depiction of the situation certainly seemed to be accurate and believable on all counts but beyond that the story simply came across as incomplete and the direction of the movie appeared to be uncertain and haphazard. The actors put in a good effort but for me I didn't really get what the movie was trying to be. It's not as atmospheric and gripping as Full Metal Jacket not as epic as Band of Brothers not as action packed as...well anything. I certainly can't see why it was nominated for so much nor why people are 'hyping it up' to these epic proportions. Mind you given the calibre of movies in the last couple of years I suppose there's not a lot to choose from. 
 This movie deserves credit for its original approach. It combines elements of theater film and epic storytelling. Unfortunately it falls flat on all levels. The films biggest weakness is it's unwillingness to commit to anything; it has camp moralistic and epic elements without ever committing to any of them. As for the story itself Chretien de Troyes is spinning in his grave at this horrible adaptation which turns the lovable unbearably innocent Percival into a most ungallant and rude churl. Most likely two types of people will see this francophiles or Arthuriophiles. Speaking as one of the latter I found the movie unwatchable and an incredibly shabby disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story. 
 I have been watching horror movies since I was 5 years old beginning with Childs Play.Since then I have seen good horror movies and bad but this is without question the DUMBEST movie I have ever seen! The actors did all they could with the material. The plot was just idiotic. Plus it was just all gore. I can stomach a lot of blood but that was just ridiculous! In one of the scenes a character gets stabbed in the rear end and choked with his intestines! Plain Stupid! Another problem with this movie is that its boring and probably the slowest movie ever made. The end of it is just dumb. But then again it goes with the rest of it! At the end when the girl gets away from the cannibal/ancestor she receives help from a old lady. The old lady is making tea but when she turns around to talk to the girl the girl attacks her! She turned into a cannibal! Retarded movie. 
 This is another one of those movies that could have been great. The basic premise is good - immortal cat people who kill to live etc. - sort of a variation on the vampire concept. The thing that makes it all fall apart is the total recklessness of the main characters. Even sociopaths know that you need to keep a low profile if you want to survive - look how long it took to catch the Unibomber and that was because a family member figured it out. By contrast the kid (and to a lesser extent the mom) behave as though they're untouchable. The kid kills without a thought for not leaving evidence or a trail or a living witness. How these people managed to stay alive and undiscovered for a month is unbelievable let alone decades or centuries. It's really a shame - this could have been so much more if it had been written plausibly i.e. giving the main characters the level of common sense they would have needed to get by for so long. Other than that not a bad showing. I loved the bit at the end where every cat in town converges on the house - every time I put out food on the porch and see our cats suddenly rush in from wherever they were before I think of that scene. 
 Like most people I was intrigued when I heard the concept of this film especially the film makers were then attacked aspect that the case seems to emphasize what with the picture on the cover of the film makers being chased by an angry mob. Then to watch the film and discover oh what they mean by the film makers were attacked was some kids threw rocks at a sign and a number of people complained loudly and said Someone should beat those two kids up. The picture on the cover the chase as it were? Total fabrication. Which I guess ties in with the theme of the film lying and manipulation to satisfy vain stupid children with more money and time then sense. I have no idea what great truth the viewer is supposed to take away from this film. It's like Michael Moore's Roger & Me but if Roger & Me was Moore mocking the people of Flint. It's completely misdirected and totally inane. Wow! Can you believe that people who suffered under the yoke of Communism would be really excited to have markets full of food? What jerks! And it's not so much Look at the effects of capitalism and western media blah blah blah since it wasn't just that their fake market had comparable prices to the competitors it was that as many people in the film say the prices were absurdly low someone mentions that they should've known it was fake by how much they were charging for duck. That's not proving anything except that people who are poor will go to a store that has low prices bravo fellas way to stick it to the people on the bottom. Way to play a stupid practical joke on elderly people. You should be very proud. How about for your next movie you make a documentary about Iraq and show how people there will get really excited for a house without bullet holes in the walls and then say HAHA! NO SUCH HOUSE EXISTS! YOUR SO STUPID AND LOVED TO BE LIED TO BY THE MEDIA! . Morgan Please Like Me Spurlock unleashed this wet fart of a film and it's no surprise since Spurlock as One Hit Wonder prince of the documentary world seems to throw his weight behind any silly sounding concept to stay relevant in a world that really has no need of him. Avoid like the plague. 
 Well I was excited at first to download an animated open source movie only to be ruined by a demo reel. The animation is excellent the lip syncing is awful and you keep watching the movie hoping to understand what's going on only to realize nothing is going on. You feel no emotion for the characters only pity for the creators for wasting their time. I have seen short films with twice the emotion in half the time! This could of been an excellent short film if they had just taken the time to hire a real director. I'm sure everyone over at Blender is excited to showcase their software and its rendering capabilities but sorry guys-story telling is what makes a movie. 
 Oh My God! Please for the love of all that is holy Do Not Watch This Movie! It it 82 minutes of my life I will never get back. Sure I could have stopped watching half way through. But I thought it might get better. It Didn't. Anyone who actually enjoyed this movie is one seriously sick and twisted individual. No wonder us Australians/New Zealanders have a terrible reputation when it comes to making movies. Everything about this movie is horrible from the acting to the editing. I don't even normally write reviews on here but in this case I'll make an exception. I only wish someone had of warned me before I hired this catastrophe 
 I am a lover of B movies give me a genetically mutated bat and I am in heaven. These movies are good for making you stop thinking of everything else going on in your world. Even a stupid B movie will usually make me laugh and I will still consider it a good thing. Then there was Hammerhead which was so awful I had to register with IMDb so I could warn others. First there was the science of creating the shark-man which the movie barely touched on. In order to keep the viewers interested they just made sure there was blood every few minutes. During one attack scene the camera moved off of the attack but you saw what was apparently a bucket of blood being thrown by a stagehand to let you know that the attack was bloody and the person was probably dead (what fabulous special effects). Back to the science I thought it was very interesting that the female test subjects were held naked and the testing equipment required that they be monitored through their breast tissue. Anyway this movie had poor plot development terrible story and I'm sorry to say pretty bad acting. Not even William Forsythe Hunter Tylo or Jeffrey Combs could save this stinker. 
 In my opinion this movie advances no new thought. seems to me like taking a spear to a spear without looking to the side! the director seems to have an agenda! Duh! I find that his rational is lacking there does not seem to be room for the alternative view. I for one am usually on the side of the naysayer but this movie lacks credibility as it relies on the fantastic observations of the man/woman on the street. really now if you wish to cr5eate a credible alternative to a creed held onto for 2000+ years you have got to make more of an effort allowing the other side to voice their beliefs. I'm not sure but at the beginning of the movie it felt like an attack on the Cristian faith I for one am a non believer but allow for the beliefs of others and would not wish no ridicule them but try to understand and tolerate. 
 I watched this film not really expecting much I got it in a pack of 5 films all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could I expect? and you know what I was right they were all terrible this movie has a few (and a few is stretching it) interesting points the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch the drummer is very like a drummer i.e damned annoying and well thats about it actually the problem is that its just so boring in what I can only assume was an attempt to build tension a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious (I had my thumb on the fast forward button ready to press for most of the movie but gave it a go) and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking coz they don't half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot I thought he looked a bit like a meercat all this and I haven't even mentioned the killer I'm not even gonna go into it its just not worth explaining. Anyway as far as I'm concerned Star and London are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of London (who was actually quite funny) it wasn't because of their acting talent I've certainly seen a lot worse but I've also seen a lot better. Best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry. 
 The Lady in Cement is a veritable course on social anthropology of the late 60's. The writing not the acting is at center stage. Did I say - pure camp! Prepare to be offended if you are female or gay. Broad and dame are standard terms and gay baiting and bashing are represented for what they were in the day (camp- wise). Most of the lines are tossed off although there are wonderful performances by a very few outstanding character actors. The action scenes are mundane but it is fun to see Dan Blocker play a tough guy who likes bashing toughs. And Lanie Kazan and Racquel Welsh are at the voluptuous peak of their careers. Amazing to note they were both 28 years old and Mr. Sinatra was 53. The musical score wait . . . was there a score? Well you get the point. Watch it with friends who want a good laugh. it's full of them. 
 Hands down the worst movie I have ever seen. I thought nothing would ever dethrone Last Action Hero but this does easily. The movie is about 3 single guys who meet on Sundays to discuss their sexual escapades from the weekend. A fourth guy - who is married and - that used to be a part of the group shows up and talks about what he and his wife do. Nothing works in this movie. The jokes are not funny but they are repeated throughout the movie. The big kicker at the end of the movie is laughable. Avoid at all costs. 
 Blue monkey is actually mentioned in the film but not in any way that makes any possible sense. At one point some kids are wandering thru the deeper levels exploring. They begin to discuss what they'll find down there and one of them (a girl) says she bets they'll find a blue monkey. Yes thats it. Totally inconsequential to the story the only sad connection to the title and no idea why she would suppose she'd find a blue monkey in a hospital's basement. I'm embarrassed for having remembered it but somebody had to remember I suppose! 
 If you have beloved actors Peter Falk Rip Torn George Segal and Bill Cobbs you don't need Billy Burke Coolio or any other distractions. Massive talent is totally wasted in Three Days to Vegas with the blame falling squarely on the script. My neighbor's vacation films are about as interesting as this misguided road movie. If you want to see how to utilize a veteran cast with a good script check out The Crew . There really are no redeeming factors here and watching these wonderful actors struggling with such weak material is a crime. I wanted to like it but the shallow script cheats the audience by essentially giving the actors nothing to work with. - MERK 
 I give this movie 3 out of 10 because I have watched zillions of movies and I can tell clearly what an intellectual movie with a mind-teasing message should look like. Definitely The Broken is not one of those movies. I have to admit that the movie made me think a lot trying to understand what the whole thing was trying to lead to and despite the explanations I've read in prior comments they seemed only an exaggeration just to have one self in the intellectual league of people. the photo on the cover clearly shows that the Broken is the broken upper piece of the face which normally contains the brain. It's a clear message that once this part of the body is broken the rest will be deformed and lifeless. So you start waiting on the movie characters to show their defected sides and this is not obvious in any of the scenes because the movie starts right away without any introduction to the characters and their lives before. Though we see the father holding a rifle when his children try to surprise him as if he is aware he has enemies but still this is not a very strong clue. Had the clues been planted more in the movie one would have said about that it is a masterpiece indeed. But though the movie was so slow in pace it was at the same time so empty with no metaphorical scenes at all. And the reuniting of the evil dad with the evil Gena at the end is a strong refuting evidence of the existential messages that some people spoke about in other comments. Furthermore if Gena truly lives in the apartment as her brother tells her at the end then how come she is the evil one? I bet I can defy any theory about this movie with so many questions that can only lead to one conclusion: This movie is a pretentious one and a waste of time. Obviously it shows someone trying to make out of a meaningless mystery something which is of no value at all. I am a huge fan of horror movies and specially slasher ones that some people call popcorn movies. Horror movies are not supposed to convey deep messages! They're supposed to uncover the beautiful mask of life and show you the other dark side of it which is the truest I guess. Horror movies should have blood screams intensity skeletons body organs and parts. Because that is the real horror and it's never away from reality. I have watched almost all horror movies and I can prove that each one of them can be as real as the sunrising. Nothing is unreal as long as the mind had thought of. For instance the horror movie Train with all the slashing and tensity of it and its similarity almost in everything with Hostel it speaks about a very real thing which is selling body organs illegally by abducting people in foreign places where no one would ask or search for them. And even if we considered the Broken a movie that has an existential message it is still very poorly presented and the least scary. I prefer the addiction message presented in Requiem for a Dream which went beyond drug addiction to highlight the fact that any kind of addiction whether for sex TV safety/being pampered etc... can be so destructive and it scared the hell out of me. And those who always criticize horror movies for being meaningless and very commercial are usually just bunch of people who get scared easily and simply don't like this genre but this doesn't mean that there are fans of such movies and that they have a lot to offer to the viewer from adrenaline turmoils ecstasy leadership lessons (believe it or not!) entertainment to most importantly the face to face interview with the essence of life as ugly and scary as it may seems Death! 
 96 minutes of this is cruel..and I love the old Munster's. Yes the plot is thing; yes the lines are trite; but whoever was at the helm of this was not a fan. There is so much 'intrigue' (and I use that word with great pause) that I wonder if it's an old Starsky & Hutch episode. I lost count of the number of times I noticed that makeup had missed a spot near the collar. Refusing to acknowledge that any time had passed since the mid-60's (ludicrous) the producers simply replace Marilyn & Eddie with younger actors. Why not let them grow and age? The addition of an Addam's Family style reunion does not add to the flavor of the Halloween Party. Grandpa & Herman fly to Transylvania and back in a few hours (preposterous.) Sid Ceaser is the most yes the most unbelievable character (I am including the bad robots) since he babbles an unwild combination of gibberish & yiddish but claims to be an ancient Arabic ruler. And yes it looks like the laugh track is missing. In fact there are several spots where there is dead air as if the laugh track was to be inserted later. The actors seem to wait on the faux audience. It's not laughable; it's sad. Oh and the best part! Yvonne DeCarlo has a line that just goes to show you how out of touch the writers and producers were. Marilyn says something like: Where could Uncle Herman and Grandpa be? They could have been in an accident. They could have been hit by a car...or a train! Lily says responds with something like: You're Uncle Herman will be here if he has to drag himself off the train track. What's amazing about this is: Yvonne DeCarlo's husband was a stuntman in the early 60's and lost a leg and was nearly killed in a train stunt. He never recovered and this financially devastated her family. (check out Biography's fantastic review of her life and career) This line could have been easily changed to be more sensitive to her. If you are a real fan of the Munster's then you'll have to RENT this mess. It illustrates how some things are better left alone. Even with the (nearly) original cast this is almost as bad as the attempted remake of the show a few years ago. 
 This movie was absolute torture. First of all it's a whopping 4+ hours long! True the Kargil war may have had several points that were captured and fought for but every single one of those battles need not have been shown. So maybe this is a documentary not a commercial film as advertised. Sure didn't seem like it as enough background information was not given and there were some flaws. The battle sequences were so poorly executed. I am terribly disappointed from the man who gave well done sequences in Border. Each battle was the exact same as the previous. It was so predictable. (This might be a spoiler.) The whole army marches uphill five or so soldiers curse five thousand times each (they also use the same cussword every time) one of the lead actors is shot someone yells for a stretcher the actor says No don't get a stretcher. That will take 6 men from the battalion and then an actor dies. That exact same thing happens over and over and over again. Oh and the songs are so bad and so long. The cast of the movie is too big for its own good. Despite such a long movie none of the characters were well developed. The actresses had the most miniscule roles. They all are dressed and portrayed to be the same. Two of them were weeping synchronized. It was so comical. They moved their hands and heads at the exact same time and then bit their dupatta together. The list just goes on and on. I know I'm still forgetting something . Anyways I think I have bashed the film enough that you get the picture. 
 In the days before gore and sex took over real horror films were made. Castle of Blood is in my estimation one of the finest although other reviewers have given it mixed ratings. In an odd sort of way it reminds of the more recent The Others which was in the theaters a couple of years ago. Director Antonio Margheriti remade his own picture in 1970 titling it this time Web of the Spider (AKA Nella Stretta Morsa del Ragno). Why he did this I do not understand although the remake starred Anthony Franciosa and Klaus Kinski and was very good in its own right. Perhaps he saw a good story and wished to tailor it more to American audiences. I do not really know. It is interesting that he did the original in black and white and the remake in color. Castle of Blood is excellent Italian Gothic. La Danza Macabra is said to be an unpublished work of Edgar Allen Poe who appears in this film. Poe and Lord Blackwood owner of a haunted castle bet American writer Alan Foster (George Riviere) that he cannot spend All Souls Night in said castle and survive. Foster eagerly accepts the bet but soon regrets it for he is witness to a series of murders committed by ghosts. It seems that the ghosts come back to life once every few years but are doomed to re-enact the crimes they committed in life. Lord Blackwood conveniently forgot to tell Foster that his blood is needed for them to resurrect themselves on the next All Souls Night! It does not take Foster and the beautiful Elisabeth Blackwood (portrayed by the incomparable Barbara Steele) long to fall in love even though their romance is doomed because Elisabeth is one of the ghosts. I will not give the ending away but will just say that Castle of Blood is every bit a romantic tragedy as it is a horror story. Comments. This film is greatly atmospheric even by the excellent standards of the Italians. My personal opinion is they do true horror better than anybody and the somewhat dim black and white filming only enhances this. In fairness Web of the Spider was fine in its own right even with color and greater brightness. I loved the lingering shots something most modern day directors do not have the patience for. Indeed when Alan first enters the doomed castle we are treated to several minutes of him doing nothing but roaming around from room to room the dread ands unease building in his face and mannerisms. By the time the first ghost appears the audience is thoroughly primed and ready. There is wonderful dialogue between Alan and the ghosts something else not often done in standard ghost stories. There are also memorable scenes very visual for this type of film. Elisabeth's murder and the dance scene (reminds somewhat of the similar dance of the ghouls in 1962's Carnival of Souls) were particularly good. Sadly few general interest viewers will ever hear of much less see this film. That is a shame for this one is a cut above the rest. I got my copy from Sinister Cinema and am not certain if it can be purchased anywhere else. For persons interested in this genre it is a must see. 
 Another rape of History This movie is a catastrophe; it just uses a historic story and makes a sweet love story with bad acting and low budget production. The movie should be 1/3 the time they just dragged the time to make a mini series. The battle scenes are so stupid and illogical the solders log stupid the costumes a catastrophe. The Romans were good in fighting in opened areas one of their armies was completely destroyed by the Germans when they tried to fight in a forest in this movie the Romans choose to fight in side the city I mean get real. And by the way Cleopatra was from a Macedonian origin which means a light skinned person. 
 This is really terrible. The only redeeming feature about this movie is that the next time people ask me what is the worst vampire movie I have ever watched I would have a suitable reply. I think it is filmed on 35 mm so it is already tacky like hell. I wouldn't have bothered commenting but I noticed some fanboys (probably connected to the movie) had claimed that this was the best movie since the Matrix. Let me debunk the myths and lies. There is nothing good in the movie. Everything yells tacky. The actress is ugly. The fight choreography is the worst I have ever seen. The fight scenes are unbelievably amateurish. Imagine a girl flailing her arms around in a circle helplessly and delivering weak kicks which wouldn't hurt a kitten. Obviously the director just pulled people off the street to give them roles in the movie. I know the director did not have much budget for the movie but still better movies have been made on smaller budget before. Unforgivable. 
 I went to see this movie with my 17 y.o. daughter. I insisted we go the matine showing not because I'm a tightwad but just feeling I had. In the NASCAR spirit this is a sponser's dream. SO much blatant advertising it almost qualifies as an info-mercial if it weren't for the so-called acting. Keeping with tradition the Herbie franchise continues with its cheesy story lines the car is only a 'vehicle' (no pun intended)for this cornball of a motion picture. Earlier Herbie installments (although cheesy as well) were produced during more serious times making them a little easier to digest. Ms. Lohan Disney's reigning drama queen has little acting ability. I was surprised that Mr. Keaton and Mr. Dillon would get involved in such a project. Only the snack bar was a bigger ripoff! 
 Start with the script. I have seen cartoons with more depth than Envy . Anytime characters keep repeating what you have already seen and was not funny the first time a movie is in deep trouble which Envy certainly is. A movie that relies on one joke had better have somewhere to go with it. Here we have a film that goes absolutely nowhere. Christopher Walken especially would like to forget this bomb because his character is so weak. Ben Stiller has been in some pretty good black comedies Flirting With Disaster and Duplex immediately come to mind. Be certain that Envy is not a black comedy. There are no double meanings just total nonsense. Envy deserves it's low rating because like it's subject matter it stinks. - MERK 
 There aren't many good things to say at all about Underneath Soderbergh's untrue endeavor into neo-noir. Soderbergh remakes Robert Siodmak's decent noir Criss-Cross faithfully not altering the plot very much at all however the adaptation drains it of every ounce of its state-of-the-art film noir atmosphere giving it the same story set in the very least appealing places lifestyles and anachronisms. Soderbergh who would later make wonderful crime films like Out of Sight and the Ocean's series with great style and atmosphere takes the dangerously obvious route to modernization by renovating the story with the ugliest dullest and flattest fashions of the early 1990s. Nightclubs have terrible revoltingly dressed garage bands Peter Gallagher's uninteresting version of Burt Lancaster's anti-hero is left by his femme fatale girlfriend for compulsively buying cinematically lifeless modern appliances like stereos TVs and other up to date pieces of equipment that suck the reaction out of the film. It could've been more entertaining and less boring had it a few saving graces like a good score more flesh to its characters more than just William Fichtner giving performances that aren't wooden a crisper pace. Unfortunately Underneath has none of these things. Soderbergh a fine director does not utilize his dry detachment to the benefit of his film this time. That disposition works wonderfully when he's helming a crime movie with more tongue in its cheek like the George Clooney pictures previously mentioned or a social or character drama like Traffic or sex lies and videotape. With a movie like Underneath it intensifies the boredom experienced by the viewer. 
 The Hazing is one of them films I always wanted to see solely based on the illustrated cover image here on IMDb. Yes that's how shallow I am! I don't care if ten million people call it a crap movie the poster looks awesome so I guess I'll just have to see it ? Now The Hazing can somewhat be described like its alternate title: curious! The poster and title make it sound like a genuine horror movie set on campus and dealing with sinister initiation rites but this movie is actually more of a crossbreed between comedy and thriller. First of all there's something very wrong with the tagline on the old VHS box I watched. It says: He had good grades a good girl and good buddies ? until they put him through the Hazing . That's not the case actually. Protagonist Gilbert Lewis is finally accepted by an acclaimed campus through an athletics scholarship. It takes over half the movie before we even hear about his girlfriend back home and the only buddy he has is a very nerdy Charles Martin Smith (still with hair in this film). Both of them are approached to become members of the prestigious Delts fraternity but during their hazing exam ? in which they have to descend a mountain dressed in their tidy white undies ? Barney falls off a cliff and breaks his leg. When Lewis returns with the other frat boys Barney froze to death already. Together they intended to keep the body frozen for five days and then claim he never returned from a weekend ski-trip. With Barney's body hidden in the cafeteria freezer Lewis has to cover for him so that Barney's absence doesn't look suspicious. The set-up of The Hazing is quite original and potentially innovative but the problem here is that the execution could easily have been a lot better. The tone is too steady and too serious for a comedy movie even a black one but on the other hand there aren't any proper attempts to build up suspense or thrills neither. The soundtrack is cheerful and full of light-headed tunes but that's nearly not enough to make this film a comedy. Around an hour into the film the plot also runs out of steam and idea and the makers have no better alternative to fill up the emptiness with romantic compilations of Lewis and his outer town girlfriend biking through the countryside. I didn't like the final twist because it's quite implausible and because it has been done numerous times before and after (though admittedly after). The Hazing is not a complete waste of time but still I'm glad I found an ex-rental tape at a friend's house instead of having to spend any money on the recently released DVD. 
 Roman Polanski has made many many movies that are unexceptional. His fame bewilders me. Nothing stands out as a high point except Chinatown (I haven't seen 'Knife in the Water' or 'Tess'). Any contribution he's made to film concluded more than twenty years ago; his work is just embarrassing safe and/or dull (The Pianist Frantic Oliver Twist The Ninth Gate Pirates). R's Baby must have signified the end of the establishment at the time it came out. It's lux-produced and fairly high concept for a 1968 'horror' movie (never show the baby). But this is just misconceived horror sap. Everything is arty to the point that the plot line becomes hopelessly clear very early (Um thanks for that finale-destroying title) and on a clear day you can see the twist ending coming for days. It did not sustain my interest. I find that whatever this movie might have been it is utterly derailed by the 1960's version of what femininity was. Farrow is such a chronic distracted helpless waif/housewife. Her frailty is oversold... she's irritating in the extreme. There's no real ideas in it... nothing to consider except being the mother of the devil. The Dakota is barely exploited for it eerie potential. 
 So the other night I decided to watch Tales from the Hollywood Hills: Natica Jackson. Or Power Passion Murder as it is called in Holland. When I bought the film I noticed that Michelle Pfeiffer was starring in it and I thought that had to say something about the quality. Unfortunately it didn't. 1) The plot of the film is really confusing. There are two story lines running simultaneously during the film. Only they have nothing in common. Throughout the entire movie I was waiting for the moment these two story lines would come together so the plot would be clear to me. But it still hasn't. 2) The title of the film says the film will be about Natica Jackson. Well it is sometimes. Like said the film covers two different stories and the part about Natica Jackson is the shortest. So another title for this movie would not be a wrong choice. To conclude my story I really recommend that you leave this movie where it belongs on the shelf in the store on a place nobody can see it. By doing this you won't waste 90 minutes of your life as I did. 
 This was a popular movie probably because of the humor in it the fast-moving story an underdog character who shuts up all the loudmouths etc. Funny thing is you probably couldn't make a movie with this title if you substituted anybody but white as anything else would be deemed racist by the PC police. Nonetheless Woody Harrleson as the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players is interesting as is his main counterpart Wesley Snipes. Snipes had a lot of funny put-down lines providing much of the humor. The bad part of the film - which doesn't bother a lot of people - is the extreme profanity in here and the sleaziness of all the characters. That includes Woody's girlfriend played by Rosie Perez. There are no really clean nice people in this movie. For that reason I can't honestly recommend the film at least not to friends or those who are offended by a lotof profanity 
 The character acting is a little stiff as if it is the first time man of the actors have appeared on screen. Unfortunately one of the better actresses Jean Simmons (played many bit roles on TV like in Star Trek TNG and In the Heat of the Night) dies quickly and thereafter her acting can be markedly missed. The lead role is Mr Ballard as portrayed by Cliff Robertson. Cliff is forced to carry this movie with his body language for most of the time. He doesn't do a poor job but it is a little overmuch to ask of an actor to plug the oceans of blank screen time during which the characters spend their time NOT talking and also NOT acting. Robertson's most memorable role may have been Ben Parker in the last 3 Spider Man movies (starring Tobey Maguire). The plot is predictable. A husband murders his rich wife for her money. thereafter the wife seems to comeback and haunt the husband driving him insane until he leaps from a high window (fearing the specter of his dead wife approaching him) on the day he is predicted to die no less. The second chauffeur Mr Ballard hires looks a lot like an English mark Hamill. Uncanny really! The only thing that stands out is the utter disregard for dialogue. Many minutes pass in quietness no one speaks and few act. It is a shame the MST3K guys never got hold of this movie. It could have been much better if not just as predictable with more dialogue or shorter scenes of 'nothingness'. I kept expecting G'Mork's red eyes to appear from the shadows and proclaim that he works for the nothing that inhabits this film. 
 This movie is not as good as all the movies of Christ I've ever seen. And I'm quite amazed that in this story Pilate wants to finish Jesus when the Scriptures (as well the other movies) state differently. It lacks also a very important issue: The Resurrection.. None of the other movies skip this very important part: the faith of all of us Christians lies in this very event. As Paul says in one of his letters If Christ did not rise from the dead our faith is vain . A very impressive scene for me in this movie was seeing on the streets the remains of the palms that were used when Jesus entered Jerusalem. Finally and in opposition to my Jewish co-commentator Jesus WAS NOT a myth. And as a matter of fact he was also a JEW. There are plenty of documents (relgious and secular) that prove the existence of this extraordinary man(or should I said God become a man) that indeed changed mankind. I strongly advise him(given he is a historian) to read about Flavius Josephus the most brilliant Jewish commentator of the 1st. Century. 
 Absolute garbage worse fight scenes than a 20 year old van damme movie or American ninja etc. Truly dire acting not a skill in sight in the entire movie its like a cast of wooden sculptures. Watch it just for how truly bad this film is it may have been acceptable in the 80s but this is a 2006 movie i don't have much love for this movie as it wasn't born in the 80s. If you like real fight movies then check out tony jaa in ong bak and the protector those are proper martial arts films. have a laugh and watch this today you may see the unintenional humour at how grim it is. 
 I only watched this because it was directed by Lucio Fulci and featured Claudio Cassinelli an actor I like. I was certainly disappointed. The idea that condemned prisoners would fight to the death for TV ratings has been overdone with Rollerball Logan's Run Blade Runner and the new film Death Race which will certainly suck me in because it stars Jason Statham. This was just a bore for the most part. The Kill Bike action was ridiculous. The training was a snooze-fest. It just never grabbed me and made me want to care about anyone including Dallas star Jared Martin or Fred Williamson. Pick one of the others mentioned and you'll be better off. 
 Ira Levin's Broadway smash comes to the screen with hardly any meat on its bones a mystery plot with just a few tricks and twists but nobody worth caring about. Frustrated writer Michael Caine plots to steal the work of a brilliant young man and pass it off as his own; his devious plan may include murdering the talented kid which has Caine's flighty spouse up in arms. The first act in which everyone is introduced is excruciatingly dead with Caine doing everything an actor can to keep the pacing up. Dyan Cannon is miscast as his wife (she's too smart and clever herself to be passed off as a ditz) and Christopher Reeve (in the middle portion of the film) seems extremely uncomfortable in the role of the better writer. These three characters and Irene Worth's bothersome neighbor are so undefined that what happens after the set-up barely even registers until well after the second act has begun. Sidney Lumet's direction is stagy and fuzzy the set design unconvincing and poorly-lit and the finale is a total disaster. The actors struggle to give the script some substance but with such thin material all we see are their laborious efforts. *1/2 from **** 
 A death at a college campus appears to be a suicide but is actually a cover for murder. The dead man's roommate finds himself embroiled in a mystery as he tries to uncover the truth behind the young man's murder. Twists and turns as well as some false leads makes this a tough case for our collegiate hero to solve let alone (keep) out of the clutches of the killer according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis. The stars may be bigger than the movie. Handsome Charles Starrett (as Ken Harris) who has a small lingerie scene became one of the top western stars of the forties peaking in The Return of the Durango Kid (1945). The man playing his father Robert Warwick (as Joseph Harris) was one of the most respected actors of the teens beginning with his performance in Alias Jimmy Valentine (1915). Watch out for red herrings. **** A Shot in the Dark (2/1/35) Charles Lamont ~ Charles Starrett Robert Warwick James Bush 
 This movie commits what I would call an emotional rape on the viewer. The movie supposedly caused quite a stir among the critics in Cannes but for me the final scene was just a pathetic attempt for a newbie director to get himself noticed. Hardly a voice in the discussion on the issue of violence drug abuse or juvenile delinquency (or any other issue for that matter). The main character's metamorphosis from good but troubled boy to the vicious rapist is virtually nonexistent whereas the rape scene (being an over-dragged exaggerated version of the rape scene from A clockwork orange ) is unbearable and I refuse to comment on its aesthetic values. There are some things an artist should not do to try and achieve his/her goal. At least in my opinion. To wrap it up: shockingly brutal revolting and NOT WORTH YOUR TIME. See A clockwork orange or Le pianiste instead. 
 This is truly an awful movie and a waste of 2 hours of your life. It is simultaneously bland and offensive with nudity and lots and lots of violence. However the nudity is not that exciting and the violence is repetitive and boring. Also the plot is flimsy at best the characters are unrealistic and undeveloped and the acting is some of the worst I have ever seen. I have heard that this movie is supposed to be funny but it's not. I did not laugh once while watching it nor did I even crack a smile. The makers of this film tried to combine a comedy movie with an action movie and they failed on both counts. Some poorly made movies are funny because they are so bad but this is not one of them. 
 About twenty minutes into this movie I was already bored. Quite simply these characters were fairly dull. Occasionally something enjoyable would happen but then things would slow down again. Fortunately my patience was eventually rewarded and the ending to this movie wasn't bad at all. However it was by no means good enough to justify sitting through the first ninety minutes. So I would say that the movie was mediocre overall and considering all of the talent in the cast I'd call this a disappointment. 
 The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael is bad film in every way. The script the dreary pace the lack of depth in any character the pointless sub-plots the dreadful acting the needless climax all make this possibly the worst film I've ever seen. I found nothing likable enjoyable or intellectually stimulating in any way. I imagine the film makers thought they were making something clever and dark with its moody lighting long protracted silences and vaguely haunting classical soundtrack. If so they failed utterly. It just bored me and I wish I had never watched it. Avoid at all costs. 
 I had read a few positive reviews of this film and was truly surprised at how dreadful the whole thing was. Positioned as some cross between an AIDS-related story and some kind of Ghost / Blithe Spirit tale this film can't always make it's mind up what it wants to be. Simon and Mark are a gay couple who have an open relationship - Simon is able to have anonymous (though safe) sex on the side when he wants. Mark is HIV+ and he and Simon don't seem to have a sex life anymore. When Mark dies Simon - who has made a habit of shutting off his emotions after being rejected years ago by his father - tries to erase his memory and just get on with being a bachelor. Not that his behavior before Mark's death was much different. But Mark returns in ghostly form and foils his various trysts while getting Simon to open up and admit his true feelings. Unfortunately Simon is such a selfish SOB it's impossible to feel any empathy toward him for most of the film. By the time he is supposed to be more sympathetic it's too late to care. Mark on the other hand follows in Demi Moore's footsteps from Ghost by crying profusely throughout the movie. There is a bizarre switch in tone after Mark returns. Suddenly we get some lame attempts at humor a la the TV show Bewitched. But that doesn't last long. Once Simon's emotional health is at stake the whole thing becomes increasingly mawkish with amateurish attempts to jerk at your heartstrings. The finale with a gold-plated muscle-boy angel guiding a tearful Mark to heaven while a chastened grief-stricken Simon waves goodbye is just stupefying chiefly because it isn't intentionally funny. 
 Absolutely one of the worst movies of the year. The plot is ridiculous the characters poorly developed and the premise irritatingly stupid. It all begins when Michael Keaton fresh off of doing nothing noteworthy since Batman loses his beautiful author wife Anna to a car accident possibly caused by her driving one of those convertible VW bugs even though she's supposed to be rich. In his grief Batman moves to a new apartment and takes up a hobby: recording nothing and then watching it. He learned this from a really fat pathetic guy who got murdered by three tall shadowy fellows who lived in his TV. Pretty soon he starts to see dead people thanks to EVP or Electronic Voice Phenomenon which is evidently this deal wherein dead people can send messages to living people through tape recorders video cameras dead cell phones ( Anna cell calling? But she's...DEAD!...Must be ghosts. Mhmmm. No other possible explanation. I'd better start messing around with this indiscriminately. ) etc. Why they can't just write something down on a piece of paper or knock over some stuff to form creative pictograms is never explained. ANyway eventually Batman discovers that he's actually seeing the future and he decides to go help this woman he doesn't know. He gets out of his house just in the nick of time because the tall dark guys enter just after he leaves ( D*mn it! Can travel between the living and dead using electronics but I'll be d*mned if we can be on time! Am I right guys? (They nod in bemused agreement). ). He tracks this lady to a warehouse and finds out that this character from the first ten minutes of the movie (look hard or you'll miss him!) is actually a serial killer working for three tall shadowy demons who in Raiders of the Lost Ark style swoop down and kill him looking like the cartoons that they are. Just then some detectives show up and save the lady. After Batman's funeral he decides to send a message from beyond the grave apologizing to his son for being an idiot evidently feeling that the best way to protect his kid from the horrors of EVP is to expose him to it. The little kid just smiles. Nothing phases that dude not even when his dad Batman of course starts talking to TV's. The high-point of the movie was when someone's phone rang and some guy yelled out It's Anna!  
 I just saw this movie premiere on MTV. I must say this was extremely mediocre (at its best). The dialogue doesn't explain the story very well and I was left feeling like there were a lot of plot holes. There isn't one likable character in this adaptation due to poor acting. I just find that all of the characters are way too possessive when it comes to someone they love. Also Cate and Heath's love seems very incestuous. They seem more like brother and sister rather than lovers. I don't understand why the father would accept something like that under his roof. I watched this movie because of a few actors that I respected and enjoyed to watch in previous films but like I said it's extremely hard to like any of the characters. Katherine Heigl's performance was horrid which was a complete shocker. She was terrible at being the bitchy older sister of Edward and there just wasn't enough lines for Aimee Osbourne for me even to critique her performance. Johnny Whitworth did well and it was great seeing him in something recent and even though his character was a bit kooky he was the only person I sympathized with. As for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel they were supposed to be our heroines but came off as whiny and overdramatic. I just didn't enjoy this movie very much or the music in it. There was a brief appearance of the Christian punk band MxPx but that small appearance would not convince me to watch this movie again. MTV did a tremendous job in convincing me this was a movie it was not. I just pictured something so completely different. 
 First of all my heartfelt commiserations to anyone who bought a cinema ticket in the hope of seeing a film in the same mould as the fantastic Gregory's Girl and Local Hero but ended up leaving the theatre feeling disappointed and vaguely cheated. While it's true that sequels are usually bar a few notable exceptions a mistake and exist merely to provide studio executives with an opportunity to cash in on the success of a previous film by offering us either a thinly disguised retread of the original story or a plot line so far removed from the intentions of the original that the resulting film makes no sense. In the case of Gregory's Two Girls Bill Forsyth has the dubious honour of managing to commit both sins - on the one hand revisiting the plot of Gregory's Girl while at the same time serving up a frankly incredible and moronic storyline involving Scottish arms dealers. Schoolboy Gregory is now a teacher at the same school where at the tender age of sixteen he harboured a hopeless passion for the football playing Dorothy. Although now thirty five Gregory still harbours a hopeless passion but now for the football playing Frances also sixteen despite the fact that music teacher Bel has made it clear that she is attracted to him. His passion for Frances and his desire to impress her lead to his involvement in a scheme to expose a local arms dealer who also happens to be an old schoolfriend. There's no point in going any further as the rest of the story is forgettable and the ending makes no real sense at all. The main problem lies with the character of Gregory himself in that there is no sign of the endearing and charming sixteen year old Gregory who actively and comically pursues Dorothy convinced that he would eventually win her over. At thirty five Gregory is presented to us as a rather sad and friendless creature whose life is neither active nor comic. Outside of work his time is spent watching videos of Noam Chomsky and reading magazines about international injustices. As his friends and family from the previous film have seemingly vanished save two pointless scenes with his younger sister who no longer offers him advice or seems at all interested in his life we are left confused about what it is Gregory really wants who he is and why he is the way he is. Why for example is he friendless? Why does he never see his father who is clearly still alive? Why has he returned to teach at the school he once attended? Why is he so interested in Noam Chomsky and injustice? Why has he become so apathetic? Why is he attracted to Frances? Why isn't he attracted to Bel until the last twenty minutes of the film? What in heaven's name do Bel or Frances see in him as he is neither drop dead gorgeous or even interesting? Why does he continue to try and impress Frances even after he and Bel have become an item and when their association threatens to completely disrupt his life? Are we really to believe that a Scottish arms dealer openly selling weapons of torture to oppressive regimes could manage to evade media scrutiny but fall foul of a couple of school-kids? Does Gregory really think that dumping a handful of computers into the sea will change anything? To make matters worse actor John Gordon Sinclair attempts to rehash his performance as the adolescent Gregory right down to the facial expressions and awkward body language. Unfortunately on a thirty five year old it just comes across as odd and vaguely creepy. On top of that it's hard to feel any sympathy for or empathy with a teacher who has erotic dreams involving sex with one of their uniform wearing pupils while they both lie on a pile of gym mats. Rather than being amusing it simply smacks of paedophilia. It's hard to know what was going through Bill Forsyth's head when he wrote this script or why he thought fans of the original film would embrace a story so completely lacking in the charm wit and warmth that turned the first movie into a classic. I can only assume that the plan was to craft a film about a man who was refusing to grow up and commit to adult life and perhaps whose happiest memory was of being sixteen and pursuing the best looking girl in the school but who by degrees is forced to accept that a life lived in the past is no life at all.That at least could have been the basis of a film which was thematically interesting and intelligent. As it is Gregory's Two Girls adds up 116 wasted and pointless minutes saying nothing and signifying even less. Gregory's Girl was responsible for launching Bill Forsyth's career here's hoping that Gregory's Two Girls won't be responsible for sinking it. 
 What a disappointment... admittedly the best of the prequels but the story is weak the plot is rushed and the end result is just a collection of set pieces poorly realised and tacked together amateurishly. There are numerous continuity errors that clash glaringly with the original films and the emergence of Darth Vader was handled so terribly that what could have been a legendary moment in modern cinema is now instead a cheesy goof that will be ridiculed for many years. I won't complain about the abysmal dialogue as this is Star Wars... the original three films had style cult feeling and cracking stories and the strange dialogue added charm. The prequels were shallow attempts to make more money and this lack of love shows in spades. Utterly disappointing. 
 I just did not enjoy this film. But then I loved Babe a Pig in the City and have been spoiled by talking animal films that are exceptionally well done in every way. The animals were not likeable. They were all irritating especially Chris Rock's guinea pig but then what could I expect it's Chris Rock. I believe I smiled once or twice at a couple cute lines but that's it. 
 I got to see an early preview of this movie and I hope they have time to edit it in what ever way they can to improve on it before it comes out Aug 3rd. It stars Andy Samberg from Saturday Night Live as 'Hot' Rod Kimble. He's plays a teenager in a small town who wants to be a stunt man like his late father. When we meet him he's jumping a mail truck on his mo-ped yes a mo-ped and almost makes it. This would be worthy of a 'Jackass' movie if he wasn't honestly trying to do this. Isla Fisher plays the slightly older and much more mature girl-next-door Denise. She seems to like Rod enough to join his 'crew'. Jorma Taccone (also SNL) plays his half brother Kevin who documents the stunts with a camcorder. Sissy Spacek plays Rod's mom Marie. She remarried Frank Powell played by Ian McShane. Frank's a real tough guy who enjoys beating Rod in some real drag out brawls. It's clear that Rod's not going to earn Frank's respect till he can beat him. We find out Frank needs a $50 000. heart transplant and Rod is determined to raise the money just so he 'can beat his ass' once he's healed and prove himself a man. A long fall down a mountain side convinces Rod to 'go big' on one stunt. Rod sets out to get seed money by charging for doing stunts that would make you cringe if you saw them in real life. Like the human torch- at a children's birthday party. There were those at the showing who managed to laugh at most of the stunts. Just when all hope and money is lost along comes a sponsor who saves the day by getting the 15 school buses Rod wants to jump. He gets exclusive broadcast rights and sets up phone lines to get donations. Rod gets a new outfit and a real motorcycle. The whole town turns out and the world tunes in. Does he make the jump? Does he get the girl? Do they raise the $50k? Does Frank get his ass beat by Rod? Wait till this 90 minute movie comes out on video to find out. 
 Ever wanted to eat worms? Here's a 'documentary' to show you how! Yeah...The kid eats live worms! And that's about the most interesting part of the movie. This movie has been pretty well summed up by previous reviewers as rather boring. I'm totally in agreement here. The movie just doesn't go anywhere....unless you're fond of worm eating! This is one movie it's almost impossible to write a spoiler for....because nothing much happens. Now on the technical side: They should have given that kid a haircut. Who's he trying to look like anyway...Bozo the Clown. It was almost comical...I almost expected him to turn into the shaggy dog or something. And on top of that; the kid was way too chunky to ever look hungry! Should have kept him off the junk food for a couple of weeks before filming. All in all this movie nearly put me to sleep. And my kids could only handle about 15 minutes before they left the scene for something more interesting. I will admit that the scenery was very impressive. And had there been a decent story to go with it it might have made a hit. It did seem safe enough for kids to watch: The bear scenes and the 'oddball' eyeball were too weak to frighten most kids and the brief 'skinny-dipping' scene didn't show anything. I gave this one a very generous 3. 
 First off I would like to say that I am a fan of Chris Rock. I like his other movies but this movie is just like my summary. The Biggest Sack of Crap ever. In the beginning Chris Rock plays an aspiring comedian who get stage fright at a Comedy Building called the Apollo. On his way home from a gig while riding his BIKE he sees this woman he likes and is hit by a Truck. A little while later he chooses the body of an old white and selfish millionaire. Then he dresses up like the music group Outkast while trying to replay the scene from the original where he comes out as a Jockey. Second he goes back to the Apollo and tries to be the comedian he tried to be in his previous body and starts dissing the white population and tries to be black. Do you get my drift? This movie is awful it tries too hard to be like the original and in the process comes out looking like a sack of crap. Just take my advice don't even watch this movie. 
 STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Ray (Ray Winstone) has a criminal past has had problems with alcohol and is now forming a drug habit that is making him paranoid and prone to domestic violence to his wife Valerie (Kathy Burke) who tries to hold the family together but ends up coming off more like a doormat. Meanwhile her mother Janet (Laila Morse) is aware of Ray's son Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles) and his escalating drug habit that is sending him off the rails. The film follows these despairable characters as they tredge along with their lives. It is said that the British seem to enjoy being miserable and that would include watching films that entertain them this way. Films like Nil by Mouth highlight this. It's a tale of a broken family torn apart by crime poverty booze and drugs the kind Jeremy Kyle would lap up like a three course meal. It is also essentially a tale of self destructive men three generations apart and each copying the other tearing a family apart and women trying to hold it together despite not being strong enough. If you pick up a little of what it's about from the off-set you can see it doesn't promise to be cheerful viewing from the start and it certainly doesn't disappoint in this. It's true what everyone said about the performances and the lead stars Winstone and Burke do deliver some great acting. We see Winstone lose it with his wife beating her senseless after some more coke induced paranoia breaking down during a phone conversation with her and unleashing a typical arsenal of f and c words when she refuses to let him see his kid. Likewise in a private moment we see Burke skillfully lose her composure on a staircase the full impact of the night before kicking in. This is another of those films where there's no 'plot' to follow as such just a real life feel of these hopeless lives carrying on from one day to the next. It's been acclaimed by many (including the Baftas!) but it really was just too grim and bleak for me. I have no right to criticize it for this knowing what I knew about it from the off-set but sadly this is how I found it. ** 
 First of all: I love good Splattermovies and am not afraid to get in touch with art but this zero-budget-flick is none of it! The picture-quality is so damned low the soundtrack the most annoying one I ever (!!!!)heard and as for the FX... well the super-low quality makes some of them look not as bad as they would in a real movie (what this junk here isn't). No concept a wafer-thin storyline primitive acting and rare dialog - I think I counted about 10 sentences in the whole movie each one repeated about 20 times... same for a lot of film-sequences (may be an indication for which kind of audience this crap was made!!!) The story seems to be that a young boy had to watch his father rape and kill his mother got psychological damaged and as an adult goes touring performing a show of self-mutilation. So far so good... But for these pseudo-art-idiot-directors this plot is just a line to put cheap produced shock scenes in a row which neither have a message nor make any sense (freshly taken-out bowels are thrown on a naked bound woman in an earth-hole... why?? and why is that the only time you see both woman and thrower in the whole bloody movie )??? Disturbing? Yes!! Sick? Yes!! Necessary? No! Artistically? NO!!!!! Everyone mistaking this cheap gore-show for art should as soon as possible visit his psychiatrist or should watch Pink Floyd's The Wall to see how a similar topic can be worked out in an artful way... I hope this was your first and last (!!!!!!!!) movie Andrew Cobb... !!!! And all you gore-heads out there remember: Not everything that looks cheap and makes obviously no sense at all is automatically Art ... 
 It was a good story but not very well told. I liked the themes and the main story line which wasn't as clear as it could have been. Maybe there was too much going on and a lack of ability to reign it all in. The acting was okay to cheesy some were stronger than others and even the stronger actors had their moments of lesser quality acting. It took me a couple of months to get through the entire movie because it didn't keep my attention and the flow was just bad. I only just finished watching it and I'm glad I did as the movie finally gets moving and has some continuity toward the end. Again a good story but the delivery was sub par. Would recommend it for the story line and maybe a little eye candy and I do mean a little. 
 It utterly defeats me why Godard is taken so seriously - and One Plus One is a great example of his ineptitude as both a filmmaker and an 'intellectual' polemicist. It's hard to credit that Godard actually believed all that Marxist and Maoist kant. Anyone with half a brain could work out the bankruptcy of those 'isms' and how many people they had destroyed and were continuing to destroy even as Godard was making his films supporting them. As a filmmaker ask yourself: would you have boring voice-overs reading tedious political diatribes at your audience and then when you couldn't think of anything else to do layer another voice-over to the first voice-over which had lost its listeners after the first 100 words in any case? Brilliant Jean-Luc! As for Godard insisting on making a film with the Rolling Stones: of course he did; wouldn't you? It was the only guarantee of getting such mindless rubbish seen in the first place: the genius of the Stones eclipsing a talentless and babbling political idiot set loose with a camera. The bookshop scene wasn't worthy of even the worst fringe theatre and was an insult to the intelligence of even the young children who were used to play in it - as could be readily seen. Copping-out by allowing friendly critics to claim that all this artless crap was a satire on mainstream film-making is no more than a safe get-out to offer those who clearly see Godard's poverty of intellect and arrogant contempt for his audience. Ironic that Godard's one-time great friend Truffaut with Nuit Americain made the best film about film-making ever and Godard made the worst with Le Mepris! Incidentally Godard didn't choose the Stones' track of Sympathy With the Devil. It just happened to be the track they were working on when the 'film' started shooting at Barnes Olympic Studios. 
 This movie does not really promote kids to be nicer and have better attitudes as a family movie should and this wouldn't be considered family anyway because it has some things in it that children shouldn't be seeing. Not the best ABC Family film if you ask me. If there were less sexual themes in the movie then maybe it would be better. Hollywood isn't doing anything to make a movie better by adding in sexual situations. There's really no reason for them. At least this is a TV movie. I wouldn't want to waste my money on this garbage by renting it. If you have other things to do other than watch this movie please proceed to them. 
 The producers made a big mistake casting Mark Lester who couldn't act or sing in the title role. Aside from his very bad acting all of Lester's singing had to be dubbed by a girl. I don't know why they cast him at all since there would have been so many boys who could have played the part infinitely better and done their own singing as well. Shani Wallis was far too old to play Nancy who was only supposed to be 16. The current West End version is so much better than the movie in every way. Ross McCormack is the best Artful Dodger of all time and he is certainly far better looking than Jack Wild ever was. It was clearly political to award this old-fashioned musical so many Oscars after the tumultuous events of 1968. 
 Stereotypical send up of slasher flicks falls far short as supposed entertainment. Gerrit Graham Michael Lerner Zane Busby and in fact the entire cast are totally wasted. Lame jokes abound and every punch line is well telegraphed. The dumb one liners come at a fast pace and almost every one falls flat as a squashed grape. The musical numbers only contribute to the boredom that sets in and lingers for the entire movie. Another negative is the claustrophobic setting entirely within the walls of an abandoned high school. Avoid this and seek out one of Lampoon's truly funny films like National Lampoon's Golddiggers - MERK 
 The Darkling was a very interesting and entertaining film while F. Murray Abraham was in it. Spoilers: About halfway through F.Murray gets zapped because The Darkling is some kind of demon-like creature who enjoys living vicariously. He takes bums and losers and perverts them further while giving them all they want in terms of success. He feeds from their enjoyment of the Seven Deadly Sins. However part of it is that he needs to get people who may be flawed but not completely evil. Otherwise he cannot pervert their natural goodness. That's what the little guy said in his Barry White voice which I found both charming and amusing. Mostly amusing. Like imagine Barry White if he were a little dwarf and he was telling Aiden Gillen Dee Plane Dee Plane Bos Here eet come Dee Plane! All through the movie Dee Dwarf (actually a robotronic cherub) talks to Aiden Gillen in the Barry White voice saying things like It's OK to be bad you know you want it. Now you've committed murder you're really moving up in the world and other remarks that sound like commercials for Being Evil Stores or something. It really is hilarious in a sick way. Anyhow Aiden Gillen is no F. Murray Abraham and the movie tanks as soon as Murray gets the axe (or knifed?). F. Murray brings a certain happy malevolence to his role in this film. He is a good actor. Aiden Gillen on the other hand has a permanent happy smirk on his face and he looks like maybe his remedial English Comp. class had never hit the Mythological Characters and he could not imagine what the movie was about. The ENDING is really creepy and yet almost comical. If this movie were a parody the ending was perfect. If it was not a parody then it was creepy; but a cheap use of a little girl to deliver a gross-out that the movie itself could not deliver. The people who made this movie lost whatever it was that they wanted to do with it somewhere before the ending. It just ends like they just realized that they had run out of money and had to film a quickie ending. 
 I had some expectation for the movie since it had a nice star cast and it is the return of the duo of Akshay and Saif. Well I was hesitant to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for Dhoom franchise because I hated Dhoom 2; but if Dhoom 2 is compared to Tashan I would say Dhoom 2 is very realistic. When I saw the credits at the beginning I felt nice because it was put up in a nice way. Well the very first scene itself pis*ed me off. Then the major drawback of the movie is the action sequences. Me and my friends were laughing our guts off watching this crappy fights. It was like Akshay against some 30 thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns! Phew...you got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are. The other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story. It reminded me of some of the early 80's movies. Well the only thing the movie is worth is of sexy Kareena who looked really hot in this one.And for that I give a rating of 2 out of 10. Guys please..please...don't see this one thinking that it is a real gangster movie. Well you can watch this to have some laughs at the terrible fight scenes. Thats all. 
 I don't think I'm too far off base saying that this is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. I've been working on a list of my favorite war movies: The Longest Day To Hell and Back Bridge on the River Kwai (all black and white) which all have good plots rich characters and great acting. I've seen better dialog and acting in student-written high school one act plays. The plot however isn't a bad premise - just poorly implemented. It's kind of like a traffic accident though I couldn't seem to turn it off! A movie doesn't need big money or great sets i.e. Twelve Angry Men and Lifeboat to be good... so budget is no excuse. What were they thinking? 
 About the worst movie in distribution right now! I love zombie movies and saw this in the used rack so I thought why not? Oh my god a shame to zombie movies and fans to the genre! Whoever made this movie needs to put away your camcorder and go to film school! There are so many gore hounds out there who have put time and effort into their films and they have something that this film doesn't dignity. I know it what it takes to make films and I'm sure there was a lot of money and time spent in making Meat Market but none of that money and time went in to making it good. You need actors a script a real camera invest in some books on how to make independent films. I don't know how you got a DVD release but whoever did that is either a really good friend or banging their head on the wall. In gore films it is quality not quantity the effects are weak! I was so angry that this is actually in stores and that I couldn't get my money back. Please if you have seen this film write here and put an end to shlock. I know I'm being very harsh I only had 10 lines so I'm trying to get to the point. 
 The story is seen before but that does'n matter if you can figure out to make a proper storyboard. It is clear that the director haven't spent his work on the storyboard. Alongside this the cameraman spent far too much time leaning angles that do not match the message of the movie. The funniest is however if you take a look at the movie's website you can read that it was on purpose that the director has chosen to make the film with bad camera angles. Because it remind us about hunting. But I have never heard of hunting with poor camera angles ;-) It will have 1 stars because the story is OK. It is a pity that Ti West has not spent more time to review his story. It is as if the movie was more important than the planning. Because you have a camera does not mean you should make a movie right away... come. Everyone can make a movie but not all will be just as good. So a word of advice to Ti West are: stop and labeling what you want. Use your time to start planning and not filming until everything has come down on a storyboard. You certainly have the ability and desire - so don't abuse your talent. 
 That's what the title should be anyway. This movie combines guns explosives and mindless killing to make one flop of an action movie. Let me make my point in a series of questions: answers type deal. What happens in the movie? People die. Is that it? Yes. What is the plot about? What plot? What is the point the movie is trying to make? Killing is the only solution. What are the characters like? Extremely flawed and contradictive toward their own personalities. Is there anything good about this movie? Yes. I'm sure they used some nice Panavision cameras in filming it. If you like constant killing and greed then watch the movie. If you happen to be repulsed by such low-standard entertainment then Made Men is not for you. To sum it up the plotline stinks the characters aren't worth their while the storyline is completely resistable and nothing fits together. This proves one thing: the actors directors and whoever helped make this movie certainly aren't Made . 
 and it did. It is through my experience that when a horror film reaches franchise status and subsequent titles are released thereafter they all in turn become stricken by one inevitable factor: irrelevance. Omen IV: The Awakening makes no exception to this rule featuring another small child supposedly embracing their role as the Anti-Christ foretold by a religious prophecy. Haven't we seen this before? Wasn't it enough that over the span of three films prior to this release we've experienced the rise and fall of Damien Thorn? If you're a horror enthusiast such as myself you'll realize that it's common for a horror movie that has many sequels and prequels to its credit to fade away into redundancy - Children of the Corn Hellraiser Phantasm; the list goes on. At this point in the game I'm sure you know what to expect when you're prepared to view the fourth title in a series. Regardless there are times when you sit back and realize how shameless some filmmakers are. Omen IV: The Awakening is just that too - a shameless money making exercise. This film does not offer anything new or intriguing to the Omen lineup. As unique and genuine as Omen IV tries to be compared to its siblings the similarities and plot devices are embarrassingly alike. Elements like the guardian dog the involvement of a priest the skepticism of the people involved the decapitation death scene (clearly a homage to the original film when the journalist is beheaded by the sheet of glass)...even right down to the father's involvement in politics and prestige within the community make it too predictable. Although it is common to star a B-Rated cast into a horror title this far into a series the acting is off the charts chock-full of ridiculousness and unintentional humor due to some of the poorly delivered lines throughout this film. The atmosphere has completely vanished in comparison to the first three titles. In addition the epic score composed by Goldsmith in the previous movies has been replaced by an auditory debacle; an absolute joke and made me wonder if it was actually intended to be used for this film or just pulled from a bank of stock audio...which really says something because rarely do I comment on the lousy misuse of a musical score - until now. All in all I'd call Omen IV: The Awakening a failure. In the world of horror movies that carry a long list of titles behind them some manage to hit the mark and some don't. If you're interested in creating another notch on your weathered horror belt such as I am for completion purposes perhaps you could carve this title into it as well - if not for entertainment value then to appreciate when a film is executed properly or poorly. 
 Les Visiteurs the first movie about the medieval time travelers was actually funny. I like Jean Reno as an actor but there was more. There were unexpected twists funny situations and of course plain absurdness that would remind you a little bit of Louis de Funes. Now this sequel has the same characters the same actors in great part and the same time traveling. The plot changes a little since the characters now are supposed to be experienced time travelers. So they jump up and down in history without paying any attention to the fact that it keeps getting absurder as you advance in the movie. The duke Jean Reno tries to keep the whole thing together with his playing but his character has been emptied so there's not a lot he can do to save the film. Now the duke's slave/helper he has really all the attention. The movie is merely about him and his being clumsy / annoying / stupid or whatever he was supposed to be. Fact is; this character tries to produce the laughter from the audience but he does not succeed. It is as if someone was telling you a really very very bad joke you already know but he insists on telling that joke till the end adding details to make your suffering a little longer. If you liked Les Visiteurs do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel. If you didn't like Les Visiteurs you would never consider seeing the sequel. If you liked this sequel... well I suppose you still need to see a lot of movies. 
 I don't know why this has the fans it does and I don't know why I have even given it the score I have. This is preposterous. There are many a giallo where one has to suspend disbelief let the picture roll and catch up with it somewhere before it becomes delirious and some poor police officer has to eventually explain what we have seen. But this has very little going for it and has overlong sequences where nothing happens and have no relevance to anything while we have to listen to a most repetitive soundtrack even by Italian standards. Not a giallo this is a complete mish mash of horror ideas featuring Klaus Kinski in one his most blatant 'phoned in' performances. I reckon he turned up did a day's work and cleared off leaving Mr D'Amato to get others to fill in. Ewa is of course pretty but no it is not enough and in the end we have seen far too much of her popping up all over the place long after we have completely lost interest in this mindless and pretentious twaddle. Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood! 
 This movie is a bad to alright rip off of Friday the 13th. The movie is about a killer named Bernie who kills people around a camp councilor training camp. He kills people because the camp councilor training camp is on land that was owned by his father and when the police came to forcefully take his fathers land they accidentally killed his mother (Another F13th take off). The intro is seeing Bernie killing his first victims. Then we are introduced to a family going camping in the same woods soon after they arrive they are joined by a strange old man who likes talking about his son. Later we learn that his son is Bernie and that he has him locked up in the back of his caravan after having broken him out of a mental institute. He sets Bernie after the family so they can take their stuff and then the chase is on. This Movie is only recommended to those who enjoy B grade 80's Slashers. 
 I remember Devil Dog playing on TBS almost 20 years ago and my older sister and her friends watching it and laughing all the next day. It's not that bad for a made-for-TV horror movie but it is derivative (mostly of The Exorcist) and businesslike for lack of a better word. It won't blow you away with artful cinematography or great acting but it's not a waste of time either. It's the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you aren't in the mood to think too hard. However if you go into the movie looking for some laughs you won't be disappointed. The early scenes with Lucky the Devil Dog as a cute little puppy with Children of the Damned eyes are hilariously non-threatening and the climactic blue-screen effects of a giant black dog (with horns!) are pretty side-splitting. And keep an eye out for the cloaked Satanist in Maverick shades toward the beginning. Not a great horror film by any stretch of the imagination but I wish they still made stuff like this for TV. 
 Please be warned: this movie though a pretty bad storyline was one of the most gruesome movies I have seen...EVER. Just remember that before you settle on your sofa to enjoy the movie. So it officially begins with a party. Just your average party but there's some guy there. He's pretty into Kate...if you know what I'm saying. Memorise his face; it'll help later. So anyway Kate goes of to find George Clooney (didn't I say the plot was bad?) and so takes the tube. That's London underground at the middle of the night but she's just stupid like that. So the timetable says the next and last train will come in 7 minutes. Now Kate dumb party girl that she is decides that she can have a nap in the spare 7 minutes. Typically she misses the train and finds herself locked in the London Underground. Alone. Well almost... So the movie just carries on from there. Blood guts limbs even certain parts of the body I shall not mention are slashed and gashed and eventually amputated from the body. In short it's a typical horror; pretty but thick damsel in distress-type women and sick weird psycho. Or as the case may have it Creep. I'd say give it a go if you're into Saw Hostel or the Texas Chainsaw Massacre but for the rest of us Scream with satisfy out horror needs thankyou very much. 
 As with most of the reviewers I saw this on Starz! OnDemand. After watching the preview with my girlfriend she decided not to watch it from how bad the preview watched. I on the other hand thought it looked weird enough to warrant a watching. I mean the design of Dr. Meso alone warranted at least a brief sweep over this title. After watching it I can say that while there are some interesting aspects to it (namely the browsing over the notebooks and trying to figure out the incomprehensible story) it's best to pass over this one. *Major Spoilers Ahead* After making their first video for their as-yet-unfinished CD the lead singer Cassidy kills herself in an attempt to get her boyfriend Neil to notice her. 3 months later the band is trying to decide if they're going to finish the album or not. To try and see what Cassidy would have wanted they go to see an old psychic friend of hers Dr. Meso and try to contact her through him. In his card reading Dr. Meso turns up four straight Death cards for the four remaining band members. Bad times are ahead. (I just wanted to make a point that later in the film they do explain that the Death card really just represents change. Kudos to them on that at least.) Even without the approval of their deceased friend they decide to go ahead and finish the album. But while in the bathroom Cassidy's best-friend Dora catches a glimpse of her deceased friend. When another band-mate goes in to check on her Dora is standing in the dark requesting his sunglasses. That's when the killing begins. My main problem with the film from the very get-go is that it seems to be heavy stylized to a fault. Too many warping effects unnecessary zooms and a plethora of other cheap effects riddle this film. An incoherent storyline doesn't help anything either. While the narrative hangs together for the first part once Cassidy is resurrected everything falls apart. We have jump-cuts between Cassidy and Dr. Meso (who mysteriously was able to get into a locked building) which show they are connected in some way or another. However within a few minutes of that revelation we find that Cassidy really is an independent being from Meso. She then turns on the guy who had been helping her revenge and he scurries away in a way that calls to mind Jack Nicholson as The Joker. But not in a good way. From this point on the whereabouts of Cassidy are shown but there are strange lapses as character moves from place to place almost out of sequence. One scene we see Cassidy standing at a desk when a character enters in the next she's nowhere to be found. As he moves behind the desk we see her at the end of a hallway. Then in another room grabbing the keys (which Neil already has) then back again. Not to mention that from one moment to the next Cassidy's mood seems to go a complete 180 without a catalyst to it. One moment she wants to kill everyone (although she's only wounded 90% of the characters) - the next she's apologizing to everyone and walks out the door to die again. Sound confusing? That's because it is. It's a jumbled mess that I'm sure the writer couldn't even figure out. As for the performances most are particularly wooden. Some though are interesting but overall this isn't a piece that would be known for it's acting. The story is the driving force behind this piece. 
 THE SCREAMING SKULL (1 outta 5 stars) This movie boasts some pretty cool opening credits (an offscreen narrator warning that movie patrons will be offered a free burial if they die of fright watching this movie a scary shot of a skull emerging from a placid pool and the ubiquitous scary music) but sadly the movie is all downhill from there. A widowed man takes his new bride to his secluded mansion... admonishing his servants and friends that the new Mrs. has a very fragile disposition due to a tragedy in her past. Well in no time at all she begins to see and hear mysterious things that no one else can. Her husband assures her that it's all merely in her mind and... well you can probably see where this all is going. You will have figured out what's going on long before our hapless heroine... because you have probably seen the exact same plot in hundreds of other movies and TV shows (and done better too). To add to the movie's myriad transgressions most cuts of this movie (on numerous cheap DVD compilations) seem to be missing a few key scenes. You see the heroine slowly walking towards the window... she goes to open it... you know she is going to see something scary... and then... suddenly the scene cuts to her sobbing in her husband's arms. So what did she see??? I guess we'll never know. 
 This documentary film is based on incomplete considerations of the evidence in which Brian Flemming perhaps purposely fails to mention important evidence to the contrary. Perhaps his most crucial mistake is one of the earliest: His claims concerning the invalidity of Paul's testimony about Jesus Christ disregard key facts like: **The existence of some formulated creeds within Paul's letters. These creeds suggest that most of the central claims about Jesus were already formulated into statements of faith possibly within a few years of Christ's death and resurrection. **The testimonies of the early Christians can't just be tossed out as mere fantasy. There were indeed many people claiming to be the Messiah during that period but only ONE of them has remained: Jesus. Why? Because it would have been preposterous for anyone to have actually believed Christ was the messiah and go on to die for those beliefs if they knew that he had not been resurrected. **Even if the Gospels are dated more liberally we are still talking about accounts of Jesus written within the lifetimes of other eyewitnesses that would have pointed out inaccuracies in these Gospels. And there is evidence that the Gospels were written much earlier. What I am saying is that Flemming's documentary is an incredibly biased and self-serving piece of work that hodge podges different arguments and evidence to serve his anti-Christian view. Don't be fooled by poor investigation. 
 I viewed this movie in DVD format. My copy may have been affected but I was disappointed with the lack of menu screen for the DVD. I will say that my initial reason for viewing this movie was Claire Forlani. While fun to watch I feel she didn't live up to my expectations that I have so far found from her other films. I actually was equally pleased to see Arkin turn in a humorous performance. The other two actors I wasn't very familiar with so I can't compare their performance however they were fairly enjoyable also. The acting is the only endearing quality of this movie in my opinion. The story line while some could say slightly compelling lacked direction. I feel that the main problem stems from the script and not the direction of this film. If you enjoy any of these actors to a fair extent then I recommend this film but otherwise leave it alone. 
 Within the first few minutes of this Dutch thriller we learn that Krabbe is a gay alcoholic writer who sleeps sans underwear fantasizes about murdering his roommate tries to steal a magazine from a news stand and lusts after a studly young man he meets at the train station. And he's the hero of this nonsensical movie that is all dressed up (except for Krabbe in at least one scene too many) but has nowhere to go. The basic plot is very simple but is dragged out to nearly two hours before reaching a pointless conclusion. Verhoeven has a nice visual flair but resorts to scenes of wild hallucinations overt symbolism and gratuitous gore when he runs out of ideas. 
 15 years ago Power Rangers was one of the shows that swept the nations especially that of the youth. When I was a 3-year-old kid living in the Philippines I would watch this show every Friday on ABS-CBN (Channel 2 over there). When the movie came out in 1995 it was all shock and awe to me when I watched it with my dad and 2 uncles. My grandparents even sent me a Balikbayan box full of Power Rangers stuff (including the easy-to-build Megazord figure and the stuffed toys of the Rangers). I even played the video games and loved only one of them ( MMPR: Fighting Edition ) which was REALLY sad. Anyway it was the show that set a stepping stone on my interest on robot series (especially anime mech series like Gundam ) Now that I'm 18 I'd like to think this show is pretty cheesy to me now. To prove this I took a trip down memory lane by buying a 2-set DVD collection with MMPR: The Movie and Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie and watched both of them. I was like Ugh. How awful. Just another junk in the attic for me. For all of you people of my generation this is NOT a show that you'd want to watch over and over again. I'm not saying to leave it behind for the rest of your life but occasionally is not a bad thing now is it? Instead of Power Rangers I'd recommend something like Mobile Fighter G Gundam (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Ninja Senshi Tobikage (aka Ninja Robots) or even the ORIGINAL Sentai shows that were the basis of Power Rangers.  
 This isn't one of those reviews about poor special effects or technology or being dated issues that only the dorkiest people could relate with but rather a review on the story telling which most of us are truly interested in. The plot is about a combination of WWII Allied and German Navy members and two civilians (the hero and heroine) who are thrust together on a German U boat and wind up in a savage land of dinosaurs. The manipulations aren't so bad by film standards and we know from the plot that realism isn't going to be high. What films like this need are credible and likable characters along with some semblance of reason in the actions. This film lacks both. For a full length film only 6 characters are given any time and 3 of them are barely looked into. McClure's hero is beyond routine and doesn't make much sense in any era. The female seems to be looking for an answer to a riddle about the land of dinosaurs they entered but the riddle is not much of a riddle and we could care less. A lot of failure in a film that should have been better even for its time. 
 Interesting story about a soldier in a war who misses out on saving the life of a young girl from the enemy and is haunted by this event even though he did save many other captive children. The film flashes a head and this soldier is now a teacher in a high school that is managed mostly by policemen patrolling the hallways bathrooms and even class rooms. In other words the High School is a prison and most of the kids pay very little attention to their teachers or principal. Dolph Lundgren (Sam Decker) plays the soldier/school teacher and decides he is going to quit teaching and go into another field. However the principal asks him to have a Detention Class as his last duty as a teacher. It is at this point in the film when all Hell breaks loose and the story becomes a complete BOMB. Try to enjoy it if you decided to View IT ! 
 This is the last time I rent a video without checking in at the IMDB reviews. The Limey is directed by Steven Soderbergh who also wrote wrote the truly awful Nightwatch with Ewan Macgregor and directed such trash as Out of Sight with the anti-talented Jennifer Lopez. Terence Stamp is a fine actor and it is a shame he involved himself in such a bad film. There is frequent confusing editing that seems like it was a last minute decision in order to make up for the lack or story filming and just plain common sense. This film does everything wrong. What were they thinking? 
 There was not one single redeeming factor in this movie. The girlfriend and I both love action films. Especially fight scenes (Bloodsport and Kickboxer was awesome) but this movie was not entertaining. Five minutes of action followed twenty minutes of talking and angry facial expressions. The main hero is a troubled character who has seen battle and thus is forced to look seriously constipated at all times. The Army has disrupted his bowel movements on top of perfecting his fighting technique. The music isn't good either. They fight to the rap and hip-hop style of the streets 'cause these guys are thugs. The rest of the soundtrack is the usual background noise to low-budget dramas. Everything about this movie is classic B-style. The actors deliver their lines as if reading them from cue cards and the lines themselves should be set on fire and left burning in some rotten Hollywood alleyway. The film is called Honor but there was no honor in making this film. It was simply a waste of money and spending wisely is something I consider to be honorable. Go see Felon instead. The fight scenes and situations are more real. 
 i cannot believe i wasted 80 minutes of my life watching this terrible film i kept hoping it was going to get better by the end but boy was I wrong. The plot was abysmal the acting was extremely poor and the special effects were awful. Not even the 2 beautiful girls could revive my interest in this boring and bloody mess. However i cannot lie some of the lines in this film were quite memorable such as when the Asian boy says '' i lost my virginity to the babysitter so f**** stereotypes '' please do not waste your time with this crash unless u are prepared or want to have a good laugh .. maybe that way u can watch it to rip this movie with some mates 
 Stalker is right! Girl sees guy girl wants guy girl contrives mundane ways to keep bumping into him girl won't leave him alone girl pretends to be a patient girl can't stop talking about him girl pretends to love another guy (or two) he doesn't pay attention to her because she's annoying girl STILL won't leave him alone. Played right Drake's character could have been charming but she's completely wholly unrelenting in her pursuit of Cary Grant's character her girlfriend-in-cahoots is dull and sadly Drake's attempt at playing charmingly screwball comes off as disturbingly demented. Grant is himself as usual which is fine for Cary but it's as close to a phoned-in performance as I've ever seen from him. The direction is lackluster and the dialog is just plain dim. Screwball comedy is very difficult to do successfully and when it fails like in this stubbed-out butt of an attempt it just stinks. Worse still Drake spends the entire film in need of a lot of Valium and a restraining order. She ruins any humor to be found in this drier than mummy dust relic. 
 Without wishing to be a killjoy Brad Sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichd films i've ever seen - this being one of them and Camp Blood being another. The acting is terrible the print is shoddy and everything about this film screams seriously you could do better yourself . Maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap? I bought this for 1 but remember you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life. You'd do well to avoid this turkey even at a bargain basement price. 
 warning:It contains spoilers. If a movie starts with a sex scene then it's a bad movie. (see for example 300). This one confirms the above lemma. The second scene constitutes the spinning center of all the action. The fact that we know the end makes the movie boring. Even more other plots are revealed as the story goes back and forth several times. And this made more frustrated. To compensate the consequent lack of suspense we learn more and more about how unbalanced are the characters. And oh yes they have lots to show. Andy (P.Hoffman) for example is a drug addict more? he is cheating his wife more? he plans to rob his father more? his wife is cheating with his brother more? he doesn't regret his complicity to his mother's death more? he is a serial killer more? etc etc it's not enough space to write here... I wonder how could he have a top job. And why his wife didn't leave him before. On the other hand I enjoy much the performances of the actor Hoffman. Even here PSH saves what is left from my 7$ spent for this absurdity. Why absurdity? Because it doesn't have sense why should I care for the despicable characters? Another broken lemma is that a movie should have a sympathetic( at least pleasant) character. Also it's a lot of sentimentality for example we are supposed to care for the sufferance of the widowed father without knowing anything about the parents'lives before the crime. 
 Too bad I really like Kristen Cloke and Gary Busey. But the director failed to put this together. There's a lot of action a lot of promise but it all comes off hokey. The director didn't do his job. Promising action comes off lame. So much seems contrived in a desperate attempt to save the film. This version of The Rage (DirecTV credits it as 1996) simply isn't worth the time to watch it. Another director would have done a better job. 
 What the ........... is this ? This must without a doubt be the biggest waste of film settings and camera ever. I know you can't set your expectations for an 80's slasher high but this is too stupid to be true. I baught this film for 0.89$ and I still feel the urge to go claim my money back. Can you imagine who hard it STINKS ? Who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motivations??? Well actually you couldn't possible care less. And why should you? The makers of this piece of garbage sure didn't care. They didn't try to create a tiny bit of tension. The director ( Stephen Carpenter -- I guess it's much easier to find money with a name like that ) also made the Kindred (1986) wich was rather enjoyable and recently he did Soul Survivors. Complete crap as well but at least that one had Eliza Dushku. This junk has the debut of Daphne Zuniga !!! ( Who ?? ) Yeah that's right the Melrose Place chick. Her very memorable character dies about 15 min. after the opening credits. She's the second person to die. The first victim dies directly in the first minute but nobody seems to mention or miss him afterwards so who cares ? The rest of the actors...they don't deserve the term actors actually are completely uninteresting. You're hoping they die a quick and painful death...and not only their characters My humble opinion = 0 / 10 
 The opening sequence is supposed to show the Legion arriving in Paris on 13 Nov 1918. The troops pile off the train -- wearing the uniform in which the French Army including the Legion marched off to war in 1914! This a sure sign that the war flick you are about to see will be a turkey. (The French Army realized by 1915 that going to war in red trousers and dark blue overcoats was not working. Metropolitan French troops were put into horizon blue and Colonial troops were put into khaki.) The Claude Van-Damme (sp?) remake at least got the uniforms more or less right. Really is too bad when directors make these sorts of mistakes when they then go to all the effort to get other things right. 
 Sadly the print of the film we were going to watch burned in the fire at Universal Studios last week so we were stuck with video. That could even be a metaphor for this second-rate King Kong movie from Toho studios' stalwart director Ishiro Honda. Essentially it's a warm up for King Kong versus Godzilla . It even uses the idea of a Mecha-Kong like Mecha-Godzilla. Of course the movie climaxes with King Kong fighting Mecha-Kong on top of the expo tower in Tokyo but if you didn't know that already then maybe you're in the age group that this movie was intended for. The cast is headed by a guy named Rhodes Reason who we had never heard of... glancing over his list I see mostly a lot of scattered American TV credits so it's interesting that they dragged him all the way to Japan so that they could have a nominal American hero. The real hero of the movie is the more sensitive Japanese commander played by Akira Takarada who I recognized from Hiroshi Inagaki's iconic version of Chushingura (47 Ronin) and also from the original Godzilla films by Honda. I'm sorry Rhodes Reason whoever you are but this guy has way more screen presence and you can bet that everyone wants him to end up with the cute little blonde played by Linda Miller. We laughed at the way Reason would always find a way to interject himself between Miller and Takarada who it seemed like she kind of preferred. Of course like all Kong leading ladies her primary relationship is with the King himself. She discovers a nice trick: if you talk to a giant ape really..... really.... slowly..... he'll understand what you're saying. And if you're a blonde gal that means that he'll do whatever you tell him to do. That fact is not lost on Dr. Who (Eisei Amamoto) and Madame Piranha (Mie Hama) -- representing a nation which shall not be named -- who plan on using her as bait to get Kong to dig up mineral deposits that are trapped at the North Pole. Yes this is truly the plot of the whole movie -- apparently only a giant ape is going to be capable of digging out these minerals which can be used to make super powerful weapons. Dr. Who builds Mecha-Kong to get it but the circuitry gets in the way so they decide to go for the real Kong. Kong himself seems momentarily infatuated with Mecha-Kong a story element that might have made the film more interesting but wasn't followed up on. By the end of the movie the cute blonde has shouted Kong or King Kong in her chirpy voice so many times that when the two heroes tell her to let him go at the end they're speaking for all of us. Basically this movie squanders whatever majesty was possible in the Kong character by making him a heroic and friendly figure much too early just like the newest version of the story. Kong is just a guy in a suit in this movie and they show quite a lot of him to the point where the goofy face becomes impossible to take seriously. It's a nice looking movie I'm sure it satisfies the demands or desires of fans of this type of thing which is really more of a wrestling film than a monster film in a lot of ways. The monsters don't ever really scare in these films they just jump around and push each other around a lot. It's not a worthless movie but it's extremely predictable and formulaic so for anyone under the age of 10 or so it probably will only be entertaining as comedy. 
 Nacho Libre (2006) Directed By: Jared Hess Starring: Jack Black Ana de la Reguera Hctor Jimnez & Darius Rose MPAA Rating: PG-13 (for some rough action and crude humor including dialog) Say what you will about it (I know some people who despise it to no end) but I have always thought that Napoleon Dynamite was a funny movie--not the brightest brick on the wall but a funny movie nonetheless. Jack Black is also a very funny man--irritating at times yes and massively overrated by adolescent audiences who practically worship him but funny. There has rarely been a Jack Black comedy that I did not enjoy to some degree. So I was very happy to hear that Jared Hess the writer and director of Napoleon Dynamite and Jack Black would be teaming up for a movie about a Spanish friar who becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage. My only reservation was that the plot seemed a little too thin. Unfortunately my one reservation turned out to be downfall of the entire movie. This plot had it been done as a skit on some such show as Saturday Night Live or possibly even Mad TV would have worked flawlessly. Unfortunately the plot runs far too thin over the approximate one and a half hour runtime and this one-joke comedy falls flat. Nacho was raised in a Mexican monastery and became a devout man of the Lord. Feeling shunned by the entire monastery Nacho (Black) now the monastery's cook decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler. As the monastery's finances hit an all-time low Nacho decides to join a wresting tournament so that he can win the prize money and provide good food for the monastery's orphanage. This plot sounds so sweet and caring. It seems like the perfect movie for Jack Black. Look what he did with School of Rock after all. Well to my displeasure this plot is almost completely ruined by offensive and gross humor that just takes away from the heart of the movie. It is again Hollywood's way of showing that they feel that teen audiences will only understand fart jokes and stupid humor?of course for all I know maybe that is the general thought of teenagers as many seemed to enjoy this movie. Watching an obese woman scurry like a mouse across the floor will certainly make people laugh but don't expect to get an award for putting it in your movie. A seven-year-old could make up the same joke. The performances in Nacho Libre are actually good. Jack Black proves once again that he is absolutely hilarious and that he can make even the most idiotic worthless lines in ever put on paper comical. Unfortunately this movie just wasn't enough for him. It didn't give him anything to go on and the only reason any of his jokes worked was because of him. I had never seen or heard of Ana de la Reguera before but now I can say that not only is she quite talented but she is also one of the most beautiful women to have ever graced my eyesight. She just clicked in the role and it worked wonderfully well. Hctor Jimnez who plays Nacho's bumbling partner Esqueleto kept me laughing continuously. He did a very nice job and it was very effective when partnered with that of Jack Black's. Darius Rose who plays an orphan named Chancho didn't have many lines but what can I say I just enjoyed him. He was adorable. The rest of the cast did their job. It is unfortunate that they were wasted on such a sub-par movie. Nacho Libre just does not work. Its plot is stretched far too thin. The heart of it all is soiled by moronic humor and sickening jokes that just don't work. I very rarely laughed and if I did it was because of Jack Black or another member of the cast. And that leads me to the bright side of Nacho Libre : yes the cast. This cast was just?well for lack of a better word they were on. They all clicked had excellent chemistry together and pumped as much life as possible into the flat script. After Jared Hess's Napoleon Dynamite kept me thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the movie I was surprised to find myself so often bored with Nacho Libre . Something was lost here and I have yet to understand what it was. All I know is that Nacho Libre is not a good movie and yet because of its cast it is completely worthless. There is a small reason to watch if only to watch Jack Black work. But if you are not a fan of Jack Black then avoid this movie like the plague. I like Black but I am done with this movie and with this review. Final Thought: Yikes! This is Jared Hess's surprisingly disappointing follow-up to his hysterical Napoleon Dynamite . Overall Rating: 4/10 (C+) 
 Man To Man tries hard to be a good movie: it has its heart at the right place it aspires to be epic and it has a message that no doubt everybody will appreciate. But there lies also some of the problems of this picture. It strives so hard to be good and to get its message across that sometimes the viewer must feel unchallenged. So it is only adequate that the images which are used by this picture are simplistic - Man To Man doesn't let the viewer decide what he thinks is right but is hammering its message in his head. Joseph Fiennes exemplifies this in his role: he does his best to look concerned genuinely moved and all the other emotions you can express with the single one facial expression his repertoire has to offer. Add that the movie is overlong and loses its speed towards the end you would be easily led to the conclusion that Man To Man is not worth watching. But there are enough points to defend it: it is entertaining has some humorous scenes and the show-stealing Kristin Scott Thomas. Of course you should not compare it to humanistic masterpieces like The Elephant Man (David Lynch) but you'll be leaving the theatre satisfied. It tries to grab your heart (even if your brain thinks that it is too obvious) and succeeds most of the time. 
 After seeing this film I complained to my local cinema about the quality of the sound-track or whether the cinema sound system may be faulty. For at least the first half of the film it is extremely difficult to understand what anyone is saying because of the background 20's music and the scratchiness of the sound-track. I was ready to blame the cinema equipment but not so - it was the Director. I was told the subject of my complaint was an essential part of the making of the film. The music and the sound was supposed to be distorted to create a very disturbing effect within the film. These days directors will go to many lengths to make their film unique. Unfortunately no matter where or how you see that film the sound score will be the same. So apart from the historical inaccuracies of this film (which you can find out for yourself elsewhere) the sound-track distortions are in themselves a good reason to give this film a miss. You will only hear the distorted scratchiness of the sound-track and certainly not a cat's meow. 
 I have to say I was very curious on viewing this film and it was considered a notorious disaster when released by 20th Century Fox in 1970. It has also popped up on several critics lists of bad films and this only deepened an interest as I just had to see what made this movie so bad.Upon seeing it I think I have my answers. Although I will say it does make for curious viewing the acting direction and script are so laughingly bad that the supposed satire is completely missing. Racquel Welch seems to try to carry the film but after the opening sequence of the sex-change operation the film goes so far down hill that she cannot handle this task alone. John Huston as Uncle Buck Loner is certainly no help as he licks and leers at the screen he sometimes looks like he wonders himself what he's doing there. Rex Reed bounces around as Myron Myra's alter ego and even has his own celebrated masturbation scene. Bravo for debut performances! Farrah Fawcett plays a dumb blonde; she certainly seemed convincing in this role. But of course arguably the most notorious role went to Mae west. The sight of a 75 year old woman with a plastic face making sexual innuendos seemed more suitable for a horror film. I don't mean to put this cast down personally; but in this film no one comes out looking good. The direction seems so unassured and non-existent that the film is not only bad but boring as well. Throw in some old film footage of old stars and the movie becomes even more disconnected. To each his own to anyone that enjoyed this and I was glad I at least saw it but Myra Breckenridge seems to be the disaster that it was always reputed to be from the beginning. 
 Okay... it seems like so far only the Barman fans have commented on this film - time for a counterpoint. Beware this writeup is *LONG*. For those not in the knowing (mostly the non-Belgians) : Tom Barman director of this film is the frontman of dEUS one of the better known rock bands of the late 90's here in Belgium. Basically they made a couple of very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly rose to fame on the national scale. Then egos started hurting and the band basically fell apart with Barman and a couple of others remaining to go on making albums under the dEUS-monicker. The way it always happens in such cases the post-breakdown dEUS was a lot tamer and less interesting than the original. They tried to go for an international breakthrough with their album The Ideal Crash in 1999 presenting a much diluted form of their earlier style of songwriting. They didn't quite make it. However egos were still pretty big it seems : big enough for Barman to consider himself enough of an artist to try on movies. More often than not this sort of thing is a VERY big mistake and this film does not make the exception. And Barman clearly went for *art* on this one another very big mistake. For one thing he's a musician not a movie director. For another dEUS at it's best made fun and provoking music but never anything close to what I would consider *art*. It shows. So what's this movie about? Basically it tells the story of a bunch of completely uninteresting people doing equally uninteresting things over the course of a totally uninteresting friday in Antwerp as even more uninteresting stuff happens to them in the act of being uninteresting. The characters are shallow the plot totally pointless and the film just doesn't have any other redeeming qualities to make up for these shortcomings. Humor? The whole film made me smile (slightly) about 3 times and actually managed to provoke a single 5-second laugh (not quite loud). Mood? The film just doesn't seem to show any kind of emotion or feeling at all. Mystery? Well (*MINOR SPOILER*)the idea of the wind-man inspiring the name of the film is as enthralling as a banana pepper pizza - not very and has been done a thousand times before (anyone remember Johny Destiny - one of Tarantino's worst appearances on film to date)(*END MINOR SPOILER*). And well its *artistic* so don't expect any kind of real action to make up for all the previous. In other words except for the few smiles it bored me out of my shorts. So what remains? Well the soundtrack is pretty good though it suffers from some of the same problems that other OST's have shown lately : first it makes the movie seem like nothing more than a commercial for the CD. Second it gives the impression that Barman is trying to hide the weaknesses and lack of emotional content in the film behind the content quality of the songs which simply doesn't work. In the end it makes the film look like nothing more than an illustration to the songs. And sadly it's Barmans own contribution to the soundtrack which gets the most attention though it is the weakest part of the whole soundtrack as far as I'm concerned. All in all it just stands to show that Barman knows more about music than movies. Camera work is okay as well though not anything that would make you scream out with joy. The only thing about this movie that kept me watching was the sight-seeing factor. Since I originate from Antwerp it was fun to play a kind of guess-the-location game. I would hardly consider this as a quality though. All in all another chance lost for Flemmish film. I keep on noticing that lately the best Belgian movies have been coming from the French part of the country. This is mostly because at least they have something to tell and manage to tell it in way that is both sharp and emotional (the brothers Daerden come to mind). Maybe the Flemmish art-house filmmakers should try that too. 
 The female lead was a terrible actress which made the whole movie mediocre. She was smiling too much when she first went in front of the cameras to talk about her daughter. This should have made the police suspect her. I would have been inconsolable in the identical situation. She seemed way calm for a mother who could not find her daughter. It was as if she did not want to even be in the movie. Jennifer Aniston would have played the part better. And it would have made a lot more money for such a controversial important subject. Everyone else was excellent. I don't know where the lead actress is but I hope she got some acting lessons. 
 You gotta love the cheesy low budget movies. This one comes complete with bad effects props and bad acting (really bad). Plus every time I see Mercedes McNab (the sister) I keep thinking 'Watch out! She's a vamp! - for those that know Buffy/Angel. A perfect example of what happens when someone with bad taste and wants to waste money making a flick the little that was spent of course. I don't know if I feel more sorry for the writer of the movie or the producer who didn't make back any money. I'd say it's good for little kids in it's simplicity but I don't know if I'd want to subject a kid to it... umm...1/10 because that's the lowest it will go. 
 Despite being released on DVD by Blue Underground some five years ago I have never come across this Italian sword and sorcery item on late-night Italian TV and now that I have seen it for myself I know exactly why. Not because of its director's typical predilection for extreme gore (of which there is some examples to be sure) or the fact that the handful of women in it parade topless all the time (it is set in the Dark Ages after all)?it is quite simply very poor stuff indeed. In fact I would go so far as to say that it may very well be the worst of its kind that I have yet seen and believe me I have seen plenty (especially in the last few years i.e. following my excursion to the 2004 Venice Film Festival)! Reading about how the film's failure at the time of initial release is believed to have led to its director's subsequent (and regrettable) career nosedive into mindless low-budget gore I can see their point: I may prefer Fulci's earlier giallo period (1968-77) to his more popular stuff horror (1979-82) myself but even on the latter his commitment was arguably unquestionable. On the other hand CONQUEST seems not to have inspired Fulci in the least ? seeing how he decided to drape the proceedings with an annoyingly perpetual mist sprinkle it with incongruent characters (cannibals vs. werewolves anyone?) irrelevant gore (we are treated to a gratuitous nasty cannibal dinner just before witnessing the flesh-eating revelers having their brains literally beaten out by their hairy antagonists!) and even some highly unappetizing intimacy between the masked brain-slurping villainess (don't ask) and her slimy reptilian pet!! For what it is worth we have two heroes for the price of one here: a young magic bow-carrying boy on some manhood-affirming odyssey (Andrea Occhipinti) and his rambling muscle-bound companion (Jorge Rivero i.e. Frenchy from Howard Hawks' RIO LOBO [1970]!) who despite being called Mace (short for Maciste perhaps?) seems to be there simply to drop in on his cavewoman from time to time and get his younger protg out of trouble (particularly during an exceedingly unpleasant attack of the 'boils'). Unfortunately even the usual saving grace of such lowbrow material comes up short here as ex-Goblin Claudio Simonetti's electronic score seems awfully inappropriate at times. Fulci even contrives to give the film a laughably hurried coda with the surviving beefy hero going aimlessly out into the wilderness (after defeating one and all with the aid of the all-important magic bow?so much for his own supposed physical strength!) onto his next ? and thankfully unfilmed ? adventure! 
 Mona the vagabond lives on the fringes of French society in a life without meaning purpose or direction. I watched this because of all the stellar reviews but I'm afraid I must have missed something. The character of Mona has little or no personality while drifting through life being rude to people getting high and contributing nothing to anyone's life. She's not interesting or exciting. She's just useless. I've seen and known enough people like that: there is no secret meaning to what they're doing. They are just lazy bums. I wouldn't want Mona anywhere near me as she tends to steal anything that isn't nailed down and leave her friends in the lurch. Sure she's enigmatic - because there isn't anything to her. Lots of junkies winos and bums I've seen are enigmatic; I wouldn't want to see a film about them either. Possibly there is something there that I totally missed. Otherwise I'm assuming that all the reviews are from people who assume anything done by a French female director is high art. 
 This film turned up on local TV here in South Africa recently and I thought that I'd warn even those who enjoy watching B grade bad movies (which I do)that this is not even amusing. The plot concerns a couple visiting a house in the country. Some strangers appear and .... The problem is that most of the film obviously shot in the early seventies consists of extreme wide shots of people walking in real time and awfully slowly from A to B. This makes the film tedious in the extreme and the expected blood and gore payoff just never happens. I am really curious - how many people have actually watched this from beginning to end? 
 I've seen this movie today for the first time and I never heard of it before probably because of it's poor message. First of all the directing itself is quite good the actors played well and the CGI (I'm not a fan of CGI) is magnificent. But that alone doesn't make a movie. No story at all no message behind beautiful exploited talents. Or do I have to make people remember the art of a director is not only your vision but to know how to tell a story. And this is what's missing the whole 7 minutes. There for a simple 4 rating. 
 I'm not sure what dragged me into the cinema to watch this movie but few minutes after it started I wanted to leave the theater. For a while I hoped at least the story will surprise me but then realized it's a waste of time there was just nothing there. I stayed only because I had another show after it. Design: some designs where quite beautiful mostly of the environment but the characters were terrible both in terms of animation and design. They look great while still - on posters and screenshots but not when they have to come to life! They just didn't work mostly because the very same mistake most 3D companies make: technically it is very hard to create really natural materials in 3D that would make you feel that the character is alive. You need a lot of effort and knowledge (hence money) to create something that really feels like hair skin fabric etc. Those characters in the movie were made out of cloth and that just didn't work! So they had this ugly cold feeling of the computer artificiality where the cloth stretches or squeezes like a piece of plastic. It just didn't have the feel of a material that dolls are made of (that's what those characters meant to be). I think it was a big mistake choosing this style for the characters. It just had a feeling of a 3D shoot'n'run computer game. I don't want to go to cinema to have a computer game on my screen don't know about you... Animation was also a disgrace. I am a professional animator and was terribly disappointed at the low level of animation in 9 . It was stiff boring almost lacked any imagination or mood. It was just a little bit above most average 3D animations I saw and that doesn't add to it any good... And all that - the bad character design and bad animation could be solved with a good story right?! That was not the case here. Actually the story was the worst thing in that movie. It was below any level. It starts straight forward it goes straight forward and it ends the same. There is no twist no surprise no good dialogs even no development. We've heard and saw stories of machines overtaking the humankind thousands of times and 9 is just one of them and we know how it ends at the very first minute of that movie. The characters don't even have time to get into the story - they are just there showing themselves almost immediately and immediately some of them take action without even getting to know what's going on. It just didn't work. There are also many repetitive action sequences that looked as if they were made to fill in the time for the lack of a story... Acting sound and script - oh my gosh what can I tell it was pathetic. Bad story has a bad script and except dialogs like No don't do it! I will do it! But... you cannot do it alone! We can do it together! But there are rules! But we have to save him! etc etc and so on and repeating itself all the time so besides those terribly pathetic dialogs there were those non stop Ahh and Ohhh and Ehh and Oooh and Whatchout and Run! and OhOhh! that were following almost every jump run or fall of the characters and it even sounded as if they were out of sync or even unrehearsed. Conclusion: bad acting bad animation bad sound bad story bad script bad characters everything expected no surprises no twist nothing. Only some good designs are not worth the time. BIG NO! 
 Demi Moore's character in the movie was selected for the SEALs because of her looks. That was a bad start and the movie went down from there. The plot was totally unbelievable. The will to make it in a tough military unit is not enough. This movie did not convince me of a woman's physical ability to perform the types of tasks required. Trying to pretend that women and men are basically the same is an insult to everyone's intelligence. The differences between the sexes are what makes life interesting. 
 I have seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiest/worst attempts at one. A lot of the scenes work in a plug-and-play manner inserted strictly to conform to the romantic-comedy genre. Usually this is okay because we're dealing with a genre but the challenge generally resides in making it original new and inventive. This movie fails to do so. There is no sense of who the characters really are apart from Sylvie Moreau's (who is the real star of this movie not Isabelle Blais). They fit into this one-dimensional clich and they become nothing more than simple puppets serving the purpose of a very light narrative. The pacing of the movie can become annoying rhythm lacks and the editing is filled with unnecessary close-ups. I should also mention the overly stylized decors making some scenes devoid of any naturally or rather making the attempt at naturally seem too obvious. Of course along with that you have the right-on-cue sappy music which unfortunately often sounds mismatched. I can't believe that a movie who makes obvious Woody Allen allusions ends up being this deceptive. If you expect a good light-hearted romantic comedy this is not it. Or rather this a poor attempt at it. You will only leave the theater wondering why this film has been getting such praise when cinema is now more than 100 years old and there are far superior Quebecois directors making better flicks. Les Aimants is a good movie for what it is. But it's a bad one if you regard cinema as an art and directors as auteur's. 
 JUST CAUSE showcases Sean Connery as a Harvard law prof Kate Capshaw (does she still get work?) as his wife (slight age difference) and Lawrence Fishburne as a racist southern cop (!) and Ed Harris in a totally over the top rendition of a fundamentalist southern serial killer. Weird casting but the movie plays serious mindf** with the audience. (don't read if you ever intend to seriously watch this film or to ever watch this film seriously due to the spoilers) First of all I felt myself rolling my eyes repeatedly at the Liberal stereotypes: the cops are all sadistic and frame this black guy with no evidence. The coroner witnesses and even the lawyer of the accused collaborate against him (he is accused of the rape and murder of a young girl) because he is black. Connery is a Harvard law prof who gives impassioned speeches about the injustices against blacks and against the barbarous death penalty. He is approached by the convicted man's grandmother to defend him and re-open the trial. Connery is stonewalled (yawn...) by the small town officials and the good IL' boys club but finds that the case against Blair the alleged killer now on death row was all fabricated. The main evidence was his confession which was beaten out of him. The beating was administered by a black cop (!) who even played Russian roulette to get the confession out of him. Connery finds out that another inmate on death row actually did the murder and after a few tete a tetes with a seriously overacting Hannibal Lecter-like Ed Harris he finds out where Harris hid the murder weapon. He gets a re-trial and Blair is freed. I think... film over.... Then suddenly! It turns out that Blair IS a psychotic psycho and that he used white guilt to enlist Connery. He concocted the story with Ed Harris in return for Blair carrying out a few murders for Harris. now Blair is on the loose again thanks to Connery's deluded PC principles! The final 30 min. are a weird action movie tacked onto a legal drama Connery and Fishburne fighting the serial killer in an alligator skinning house on stilts (yes you read that right) in the everglades. That was one weird film. So the whole system is corrupt and inefficient the cops are all just bullies and Abu Graib type torturers but the criminals are really psychotics and deserve to fry. Truly depressing on every level! The system is completely rotten and the PC white guilt types who challenge it are seriously deluded too. Two thumbs down. Connery obviously had to make a mortgage payment or something. 
 A recent post here by a woman claiming a military background contained the comment A woman's life is no more valuable than a man's . This mantra of the politically correct is not true as history as well as biology show. Societies have managed to recover from heavy losses of their male population sometimes with astonishing speed. Germany was ready to fight another war in 1939 despite the 1914- 1918 war in which over two million of her men were killed. In South America's War of the Triple Alliance (1865) Paraguay took on three neighboring countries until virtually her entire male population was wiped out but fought to a stalemate in the 1932 Chaco War against much larger Bolivia. No society however has or ever could survive the loss of its female population. Only when the very life of the nation is at stake are women sent to fight. Israel faced that situation in 1948 but since then has never considered coed combat units for its Defense Forces despite the popular image of the Israeli girl soldier. G.I. Jane is Hollywood fluff. 
 TV movie about an ancient Egyptian curse brought to the US in the 20's during the filming of DeMille's first version of the 10 Commandments and which is reawakened when DeMille's sets are unearthed in the desert. One of the worst films I've seen in a long time. The question is were the filmmakers serious or kidding when they made this film? If this is serious its a laughably bad movie and a great film to pick on for its badness. If its a comedy its less good but funny for all of the wrong reasons.You will laugh long and hard AT this film probably more than many other Hollywood comedies . 
 This Italian semi-horror movie starts out very much like a soft core porn movie and turns into a mystery that has a few to many loose ends to be good that and the fact it is rather dull just makes this film rather unwatchable for my tastes. The only thing really worth watching are the many boobs spread throughout the film. The story has a guy who at the beginning of the movie luring girls to his castle where he proceeds to take them to his dungeon go berserk and seemingly kill them. They show the nudity but they never really show the murders at this point in the film. Then the guy finds a nice red head at a party and proceeds to make out with her and marry her. He has a thing for red heads you see as his beloved former wife Evelyn was also one she also died under circumstances that must have not been the viewing audience's business. After a lot of talky scenes murders start to take place involving snakes foxes and such. At this point it is easy enough to figure out who is responsible for the murders and what the motive is then you have a nonsensical ending where everything wraps up not so nicely. This movie just did not work for me it left me with to many questions and the last third of the film just did not have the boobs of the first two thirds of the film. Explaining Evelyn's death would have helped the film as would have some sort of ending where Evelyn did rise from the grave. Granted the title is not totally misleading as she did sort of leave the grave just not under her own power. The gore is very light for the most part as there is a scene with the foxes and a scene at the end with quite a bit of blood too. I just thought for the most part this movie was a tad dull. 
 Yowza! If anyone who loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and feel good about it you're a better person than me! This movie while a great attempt at 'imitating' Laurel and Hardy through appearance sound and routine falls very short of honoring them or even being a movie of any substance. I blame Larry Harmon. Dialogue is torn from old L+H movies and planted in unrealistically the plot is muddled with useless characterization of the other needless co-stars Pinchot's accent was bizarre for Stan and while Sartain did an excellent job with Ollie's accent he tried too hard to create the wonderful mix that was Mr. Hardy. Where was a (good) musical number? Editing is choppy acting is stiff lines are horrid physics are -implausable- (although perhaps they were TRYING to give it that feel of cheap sets?) and overall it's a terrible thing to witness. It's even more painful to watch than ATOLL K where the legendary duo did their last film in awful 1950's era writing and photography. Do yourself a favor and watch as much of the ORIGINAL Laurel and Hardy films as you can and learn how things WERE. You know what a MAGNATE is don't you? Stan Laurel did not perpetually reply with semi-moronic quips at every sentence. I pity anyone who thinks that THIS was a decent update/honor of the boys. Where was THE CLASSIC THEME SONG?!? Why ruin 'Here's another fine mess'? Why skip 'any the wiser'? Why was there a pointless gaggle of co-stars?! WHY MISS GULCH FROM THE WIZARD OF OZ???? WHY MUST LARRY HARMON BE IN IT? WHY BOZO!? And did THE LEARNING CHANNEL help fund the thing? I mean really. Fart jokes for God's sake. FART JOKES. 
 I couldn't make sense of this film much of the time and neither could anyone else based on other reviews. The opening scene of this film has virtually nothing to do with the rest of the story. In it a photojournalist with a big mustache cancels his vacation to get away from his girlfriend. He is assigned to photograph a mountain range. It's rumored to be haunted but I couldn't tell whether he heard that from his boss or later in the film. On his way he meets a beautiful writer (Patty Shepard) and convinces her to join him on his working trip. Throughout the film there is this terrible music score mostly consisting of noisy singing that makes you want to scream SHUT UP ALREADY!!! What really will gall a person is that the film always seems like it's about to become good though it never does. There is beautiful mountain scenery and some genuinely creepy atmosphere. The inn and the silent abandoned old buildings scattered on the mountain are rather ominous. The foggy nights look real not like someone put an artificial fog machine on the set. And the idea while not original had potential. But it never does improve at least not enough to be worthwhile. Here's how it goes more or less. They stop at this inn run by a weird innkeeper (you expect him to be named Igor) with a hearing problem. There is a scene where the writer thinks a peeping tom is in her window but the scene is so dark I had no idea what was going on. Whether this was poor lighting or a poor film transfer is unknown to me. In any event we never find out know what happened. There is a scene where she wanders off during the night. Whether she is sleepwalking or mesmerized by the witches of the title is never explained. Another scene which is never explained is when their car is stolen then found again with nothing stolen. They wind up in this apparently abandoned mountain village whose sole inhabitant is this seemingly kindly old woman. There are other things including a chained wild man in a cave who is never explained an attempt to sacrifice the writer in some way (will they kill her or brainwash her into joining them?) the witches themselves a bunch of brunette women in white robes who don't show up until the last 15 minutes of the film and whose practices and beliefs are never explained. Even the closing scene doesn't make any sense. When all is said and done most people will be saying Huh?  
 Alien Hunter: 5 out of 10: Is it me or does every movie that starts in Roswell New Mexico suck. Take Alien mixed with The Thing mixed with Contact mixed with of all things On the Beach The Andromeda Strain the classroom scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark and a throw in a little Stargate to boot. Derivative doesn't even begin to describe this movie. Of course with nothing original plot wise they amp up the gore and sex right? Nope gore is a blink and you miss it affair and sex is all tease. (James Spader causally mentions he needs a shower and the delectable Leslie Stefanson asks to join him?. he turns her down. AGGH!) In fact if a movie ever needed a shower scene to liven things up this is it. I mean if your going to have impossibly good-looking women in white bathing suits wandering around an Antarctica research base why not go for broke. With about 30 seconds of actual thrill in the entire movie Alien Hunter is remarkable serious and slow going for a sci-fi adventure. Needed a much better plot twist to liven it up and by the way the Alien itself is a horribly clichd artifice and has virtually no screen time for someone who shares half the title. I also inquired during viewing what is with the Children of the Corn in space motif. (Note that since Jason of Friday the 13th fame Pinhead from Hellraiser and that Leprechaun have all traveled to space to slay nubile teenagers why not the cornfield?) The characters in the cornfield dress like Logan's Run extras and I was just waiting for the stalks to come alive and attack them. That however would have been exciting and apparently against this movies covenant. The acting is mostly fine as Spader reprises his Stargate role while Stefanson and Janine Eser model the latest in Antarctic beachwear. John Lynch however read the whole script and acts the like the insane bad guy well before the story would indicate it. Alien Hunter is a disappointing derivative slog that makes me pine for a proper Children of The Corn in Space movie. 
 Oscar Wilde's comedy of manners perhaps the wittiest play ever written is all but wrecked at the hands of a second-rate cast. Sanders is as one would expect casually indolently brilliant in the role of Lord Darlington but the rest of the cast makes the entire procedure a waste of time. Jean Crain attempts a stage accent in alternate sentences and the other members of the cast seem to believe this is a melodrama and not a comedy; indeed the entire production has bookends that reduce it to tragedy -- doubtless the Hays office insisted. Preminger's direction seems to lie mostly in making sure that there are plenty of servants about and even the music seems banal. Stick with the visually perfect silent farce as directed by Lubitsch or even the 2004 screen version with Helen Hunt as Mrs. Erlynne; or try reading the play for the pleasure of the words. But skip this version. 
 I saw this movie today at the Haifa Film Festival in Israel after hearing rave reviews but I guess the critics were just sucking up to Willem Defoe and his wife (the director) who were present at the festival. It is definitely the slowest movie I have ever seen with numerous pointless ridiculously long scenes of nothing. Besides Defoe who was decent the acting of the two and a half other people in the movie Defoe's wife Giada included was ridiculously awful (how they cast the part of the salesgirl at the bakery is beyond me). This movie is pretty much plot less with a lame attempt to be abstract and off the wall. The only scene that stirred any kind of reaction in the crowd was vulgar and came from nowhere as if just to add some kind of shock value to the dullness that is this movie. Sorry for being so harsh but really this movie is a precious waste of time and money. I appreciate good indie cinema but this movie is not worthy of moviegoers' time. 
 This is only related to the first movie by the name. The plot has nothing to do with the first and the whole movie stinks!!! I have no idea what they were thinking but this movie is so bad. Avoid this at all costs the first movie in the series is acceptable as a slasher flick and so is the fourth but this one and the 3rd are rubbish!! 
 Man would expect that a movie shot with an approx. budget of 300 000 000 U$D should at least entertain you for the time you are spending in the cinema actally watching it. Matrix Reloaded proves this assumption wrong. The Matrix worked out better despite having apparent holes concerning logic of the story. At least nobody could explain to me why beating up a bot (aka agent) inside a simulation (aka martix) would harm the responsible computer program in any way... Unfortunately the Wachowski brothers made excactly this agent-bashing the main thing in Matrix Reloaded : it's a beat 'em up o-rama. This fighting scenes may be work out sufficient (or even cool) in a 5 sec. trailer but prolonged for several minutes apparently being faked choreographed poorly and repeated over and over again it is nothing more than boring. Despite seeing the promised spectecular stunts there is nothing more than simple low-quality unimaginative bashing already seen (or better not) in eg. Van Damme 'movies'. The difference of post-production (etherything is 5 times faster the camera floats around a lot and freezes on certain scenes and this is repeated for at least 5min) doesn't help here all this has nothing to do with the very meaning of martial arts . Beside these 'fights' all actors do refuse to do what they are payed for: acting. What's up besides the fighting scenes? Few except Hollywood routine. This oh-so-multicultural bunch of hippies which sucked in Waterworld are recycled as citizen of Zion (mans last city on earth) and on the order of Morpheus they start dancing 'cause this is a good opportunity to show a lot of barely covered tits and butts. The oh-so-popular cliche of the frog aka frenchmen talking with this je ne sais quoi dumb accent who wastes his fortune because of a liason d'amour is bravely served. Following this (and unwanted funny) is the fight between Neo and the sinister followers of 'the frog' since it takes place in an Erroy Flynn like enterieur luckily featuring a lot of mideaval weapons for decoration. For Neo posing with the hellebarde just add 2 stairs and a lot of statues (for being destructed thrown over evil guys and the like) and you get 5 more senseless boring min. of this junk. Whats left to expect? The usual merchandising hell. And revolutions which will happen or not - certainly without me. 
 This is possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don't care what the critics say it's bad. I think the problem is with Kundera's novel. It's not that it's unfilmable; it's just that like 99% of his work it's pretentious and overdrawn. He seems to be enamored with himself his characters come off as navel-gazing and his novels as a whole are misogynistic. I have read many of his works (even his Socialist Realist poetry. That was truly awful) -- I just don't understand what the fuss is about. Characteristics (like the self-absorption) in his novels make for infuriating reading. In a movie all the things that I dislike about Kundera were magnified. Maybe I just missed something but I don't think so. On a side note I cannot believe that this is a Criterion Collection DVD. No way is this movie THAT essential. 
 This pile of sh!t is tied in my book as the worst thing ever made. I can't BELIEVE that someone actually relased this CRAP let alone acually MADE it. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. Not even worth mentioning the damn story or any details about it. THAT's how bad it actually is. Avoid it like SARS! 
 It's the worst movie I've ever seen. The action is so unclear work of cameras is so poor actors are so affected ... and this lamentable 5 minutes of Arnie on the screen. My advice from the bottom of my heart - don't watch it unless you like such a low class torture. 
 To be completely honest I haven't seen that many western films but I've seen enough to know what a good one is.This by far the worst western on the planet today.First off there black people in the wild west? Come on! Who ever thought that this could be a cool off the wall movie that everyone would love were slightly no no completely retarded!Secondly in that day and age women especially black women were not prone to be carrying and or using guns.Thirdly whats with the Asian chick speaking perfect English? If the setting is western Asia isn't where your going. Finally the evil gay chick was too much the movie was just crap from the beginning.Now don't get me wrong I'm not racist or white either so don't get ticked after reading this but this movie this movie is the worst presentation of black people I have ever seen! 
 Wow could have been such a good movie Starts of with Brittany Daniels tied up Im thinking cool we are going to get a flash back but nothing movie starts anew with the kid filming. This movie probably would have been better if it wasn't for the acting. I mean the acting was mostly horrible.. Although with the lines the poor actors had to deal with i guess they did the best they could..Still it really ruin the movie for me.. The twins were the only ones that seem to have some acting skills.. The movie drags to long for the supposed shocking conclusion.. All in all I have seen worse low budget movies but considering this was hype with the 8 films to die for I was very disappointed.. By the way were did some reviewers say there was gore and stuff. Did I see the same movie.. Well this is 4 out of the eight and so far only one has been any good.. 
 The plot of this film is not strong at all lots of holes. If you approach it as a car movie its not bad lots of great cars in this one. The reason I like it is because I am from the area where this was filmed. I get the most enjoyment looking at the recognizable places in St. Cloud MN and seeing how the town has changed since 89. Its an interesting historical piece for us locals. Seems like whenever a film is made here everyone wants some relationship to it. It is impossible to find a copy in any of the local video stores as they were all stolen once it came out on VHS. Had to get a copy from Japan on Ebay I find it interesting how the path of the drag race is all over town. I didn't know the director was from St.Cloud. 
 I was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent Indian Candians but i found this show to be not funny at all. The producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back because as far as they are concerned it's getting talked about! I was ready for some stereotyping and have no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason they are usually true. But there really wasn't anything funny about these stereotypical characters. The fresh of the boat dad who doesn't understand his daughter. The radical feminist Muslim daughter (who by the way is a terrible actress) and the young modern Indian man trying to run his mosque as politically correct as he can (he's a pretty good actor i only see him getting better). it is very contrived and the dialog doesn't flow that well. there was so much potential for something like this but sadly i think it failed and don't really care to watch another episode. I did however enjoy watching a great Canadian actress Sheila McCarthy again she's always a treat and a natural at everything she does too bad her daughter in the show doesn't have the same acting abilities! 
 I have yet to read a negative professional review of this movie. I guess I must have missed something. The beginning is intriguing the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and entertain each other with invented stories. That's the best part. After the three go their separate ways the film splits into three threads. That's when boredom sets in. Certainly the thread with the Felliniesque babushkas who make dolls out of chewed bread is at first an eye opening curiosity. Unfortunately the director beat this one to death even injecting a wild plot line that leads nowhere in particular. Bottom line: a two-hour plot-thin listlessness. If you suffer from insomnia view it in bed and you will have a good night sleep. 
 This is probably the first entry in the Lance O'Leary/Nurse Keat detective series; in subsequent O'Leary films he was played by much younger actors than Guy Kibbee. A group of relatives (all played by well-known character actors) gathers in an old house (on a rainy nite of course!) to speak to a wealthy relative who goes into a coma. While they wait for him to recover all sorts of mysterious goings-on happen including a couple of murders. A creepy film; worth seeing! 
 I picked this movie up to replace the dismal choice of daytime television and to go with my thirst for femme fatales. Well for the previous it is better than daytime television....though I'm not sure how much. It does have its points but after about the first 20-30 minutes the good points pan out and one comes to the conclusion that they are watching a made for TV movie that was put together with not much time to make something that will hold together. In short a terrible Sci Fi channel type movie. It has its points such as the future is dirty like Blade Runner showed ..... of course this is no Blade Runner . The Captain looks sort of feels like actor Robert Forster the kind of person one might want to be around. But unfortunately it rather ends up feeling like a bad Andromeda rehash where the muscle of the crew consists of poor copies of the smart gunners of Aliens the mystic is vampire Willow sexually intensified and the new Captain might as well be like Jan-Michael Vincent running around on Danger Island in the Banana Splits ; he only put on the uniform with the epaulets; he's got very little right to it. All of them running around with their version of force lances inside a ship that looks very much like the 'Eureka Maru' as they are fighting a class of 'people' who occupy the universe and are broken up into several different tribes or sects of different evolutionary qualities.......just like the Nietzcheans in Andromeda . It might have a redeeming feature with Michael Ironside but after a while one gets the feeling that he took the part as a hoot! He probably had fun doing it but it doesn't help the movie much. It's ..... okay . Okay in the way that one might watch the DVD once without turning it off; if they watch it with commercials they will probably change the channel. One might watch it once .......... but a few hours later be wondering what it was that made them watch it all. For me that was the femme fatale ............. when she was fighting. 
 I gave this more than a 1 because I did think there were some moral lessons in this story and it provoked some thought and comment from my wife and I. The acting and the dialogue were mediocre and I must confess I came out feeling like I had been beaten over the head with the God this God that and Christ is our saviour stuff. The movie and the story line did not need it. If as I am you are a recovering Catholic or Christian avoid this one it will make you nauseous. The movie did a good job of demonstrating the thin line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker focused on what might have been. 
 Where to begin there's so much wrong and horrible about this movie I am not sure where to start. Okay the two stooges who wrote this crapper. Joseph Green and Rex Carlton first they couldn't make up their so-called minds for a name. My guess they split the difference that's why the main title is BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE but the end screen says HEAD THAT WOULDN'T DIE. Neither one knows anything about the Medical profession. After all Doctors take oaths to do no harm . Killing a woman for a head transplant would be considered harm . Plus a little thing called blood and tissue matching. Rejection would spell death for Jan in the pan. Plus who keeps a patch work monster. What medical school did Bill graduate from FRANKENSTIEN UNIVERSITY? Old FU or MAD SCIENTIST TECH? The monster had no name that bugs the hell out of me. Plus the brilliant surgeon Doctor Bill Cortner doesn't know how to keep a patient sedated? All and all a disaster of a movie it's incredibly stupid and unwatchable except on MST3K. I give it THE THANKSGIVING TURKEY. 
 I watched this movie because I like Nicolas Cage and well I found it strange and completely pointless... so I decided to poke around a little bit and got my hands on the 70s copy of it. Wow. what a difference. The original one was way better. I'd like you all to know it did originally actually make a statement it's existence did have a purpose. It was really the Christian public expressing their fear of paganism. If you dig deeper into it it also makes comments on life but I don't want to go into details just simply put if you were disappointed and you'd like to know what it SHOULD look like feel free to watch the 70s version a little dated but A lot better. 
 This is a badly made poor remake of Bimalda's classic Parineeta. The story is based on Sarat Chandra's book of the same name and it is a distortion of the original. Well one can appreciate some degree of creativity but not sham creativity. The acting by everyone is affected and the entire movie is a sham. Shekar's father's choice of words in abusing Lolita ( Balan ) sounds cheap and morbid and destroys the spirit of the original story. Again the scene where Shekhar ( Saif ) slaps Lolita is quite out of place with the flow of the movie and the characters is quite jarring to the senses and could have been easily avoided. Similarly the sex scene between Saif and Balan is quite unbecoming the movie and a cheap gimmick to attract the audience. When a creative work is not faithful to the original and destroys it's spirit the work falls apart. The song piyu bole is quite OK. Another silver lining in the dark cloud of this movie is the scene where Saif stands up for himself and rebels against his father. This is a positive departure from the original and deserves credit. On these counts this movie deserves 3 stars. The song and dance by Rekha smacks of artifice and it is a put on. The song is tuneful but I remember having heard it somewhere before and if Iam not mistaken the tune appears to have been plagiarized. Well agreed the times have changed from then to now. But then this movie is not even reflective of the modern times. This is what happens when the modern Bollywood film makers get increasingly obsessed with impressing the NRIs and grabbing the lucrative NRI entertainment market. Such movies end up neither belonging to India nor to any other part of the world. 
 There was nothing of value in the original movie this one was even lamer. The fact that I even found it to rent was absolutely amazing. Anyone connected to this film has to be high on something! So what was the story line? What was with the girl? Was the viewer supposed to get the story line in the first four minutes of the film. Sadly I tried several times to watch this. I even borrowed a kid from someone to get some feedback. Kid said it was stupid and he was four years old. I find that possibly some credit could go to the filming director as possibly some of the shots made the movie more than a B film. That might be pushing it. I did love the theme song. Good thing it was only a dollar it was worth it. I suppose you might enjoy the film if you were high as the cast and crew would have to be. Is pot legal in France? 
 (48 out of 278 people found this comment useful and counting...) People are such suckers for image and looks - as much as for the intellectually hollow idealism that lurks behind Communism. Che's charisma and looks have as much to do with his iconic stature as the misinformation that has been spread by Leftist propaganda (such as this movie) about him. I don't know what's worse: being captured by one of Che's murder-squads or having to sit through 4 hours of this typically Soderberghian garbage. The question isn't why this pet-project was made but what took them so long. By them I'm referring of course to Left-wing Hollywood and its secret love of Marxist tyrants (Lenin Castro... take your pick). I am fascinated that it took decades for one of Tinseltown's least talented liberal directors to finally take on such an irresistibly biased propaganda project. Where was Oliver Stone all these years? Robert Redford? Tim Robbins? Warren Beatty? Alan Pakula? George Clooney? Barbra Streisand even? It's a mystery. All these overrated artists have often indulging themselves in similar politically one-sided projects yet somehow Che Guevara who is arguably the most popular and well-known Communist hasn't been a film topic of theirs yet. Guerrilla has all the hallmarks of an American truth-bending story of an epic scale; there is as much factual detail to be found here as in other similar Hollywood big-budget political fairy-tale bios such as Malcolm X or Gandhi i.e. almost none. The movie stars Del Toro as the famous Argentinian revolutionary. Nevertheless however controversial and criminal this man's actions may have been one thing nobody could take away from him: he was an intelligent manipulator who came from a rich family - which is why Del Toro fits the bill only visually. Del Toro may be an interesting charismatic actor and he may resemble Guevara physically but he exudes no intellectual qualities whatsoever hence he makes Guevara come off as too primitive. Casting such mediocrities as Bratt Philips and Franka Incompetente only underlines the director's lack of sound judgment. The movie is to the most part extremely slow (no surprise there) and visually uninteresting. Even a director as brilliant as Kubrick would have carefully considered releasing a movie that goes beyond the 3-hour mark so it's quite telling that this Soderbergh who has only made one or two solid movies and early on in his career would think that His Oceanic Grandness was up to the task. If you think the film's length indicates that a bulk of Che's life has been shown here - then think again. Soderbergh focuses on Che's last phase and a lot of the movie is tedious jungle nonsense full of Guevara's alleged idealism. (Psychopaths don't have ideals.) I do wonder what kind of a mind this highly esteemed director has to have to actually choose to ignore some of Che's earlier life. Did he actually consider it too uninteresting? A massacre of 600 people holds no interest for the viewer huh? Amazing. Some much better directors than this over-praised charlatan would have easily fit not one but two complete biographies into a 4-hour movie. Soderbergh in a sense becomes an accomplice by never addressing the negative dark side - which is more than 90% - of Guevara. By spreading this kind of historical inaccuracy consciously ignoring the ugly truth (God forbid he should taint the holy image of Che) Soderbergh proves himself not a humanist - a fake image which most Hollywood and pop music personalities struggle very hard all their careers to uphold - but the opposite: that he cares only about ideas never about the people on whom these ideas are tested (like on guinea pigs). Soderbergh and the like are elitists of the worst kind; such people often have a latent contempt for the proleteriat (what a stupid term) they're supposedly siding with. Half of all students around the world wear Che's image on their red and orange shirts but without ever knowing why. He has become an iconic figure for clueless uninformed very often young people who think that by having this man's face on their chest that somehow makes them appear edgy intellectual hip or interesting. In reality wearing a Che shirt only underlines one's overall shallowness and total disinterest in self-education. (Wouldn't YOU want to find out more about a person before you start advertising his/her face to the world?) Wearing Che's by-now clich image has become as common as having a Bart Simpson coffee cup. All those Che-wearers probably know more about Marge's blue hair than they'll ever read up on about Fidel Castro's dead ally. After everything that'd been done in the name of Marx one would think that these mongrel ideals would be finally laid to rest. It seems mankind will never learn. Stalin Mao Kim Il Pol Pot Castro Milosevic Ceausescu the Iron Curtain a hundred million dead more than a billion ruined physically and/or mentally through this system... so none of that matters huh? The fact that Del Toro won a Cannes Award should only surprise those who are absolutely clueless as to how Cannes and other European festivals work - and vote.

 My goodness is this movie bad. I was totally misled by my local movie review because this is certifiable garbage. Yeah yeah good guys wear white bad guys wear black....and the good guys always win. Now go home and hug your kids and feel how good Hollywood has made you feel. Blech! I can't believe this brain dead movie was made by Wes Craven. I'm guessing he needed a little money to pay the mortgage so he made this piece of dung. It is the sort of production that makes anyone who watches movies regularly believe they could do as good or better than such an experienced director. Ya see a bad guy wants a sweet girl who loves her daddy to do a wittle IL' bad thing or he's gonna hurt her daddy. But being Ms. All-American girl next door we know she's gonna save the day and beat the bad guys...the end. Girl power ROCKS. C'mon now only an idiot would find this entertaining... a roller coaster ride let alone something fresh or new. All those super-duper reviews you see on this site are from industry hacks who are either making money off this flick paying back a favor or they have sold their souls to the devil. Rachael McAdams is beautiful....yup that's it. Not a good performance not a horrible one...she's just cute. She would have had to show a whole lot of skin to save this movie. She isn't tough enough to be a good female action lead. Cillian Murphy was at least passable in 28 Days. But here he plays a dumb villain pretending to be a smart one. He gets his ass kicked to and fro by the 5'5'' McAdams because after all she was a cheerleader...and a field hockey player...and I'm sure she owns all the Tae Bo tapes...so she should be able to kick the crap out of an international terrorist for hire. I wouldn't trust him to steal a pack of gum from 7-11. Ya see this movie was done before except before they did it well. Go re-rent any of the Die Hard movies. You have loved ones in danger international terrorists except the characters are more likable and believable and the bad guys are WAY more competent and interesting. I simply don't understand how Hollywood can continue to make such crap as if they were oblivious to the proper models they can readily copy. No wonder movie revenues are down. Throw your $6 down the toilet and save yourself 2 hours of your life you'll never get back. ciao FreddyShoop 
 You know I went to see The Hills have eyes 2 wanting to like it. I really enjoyed the original and the remake was fairly entertaining. They obviously had more money to throw around than Wes Craven did on special effects the second time around. Even though I still prefer the original film the remake was done well and it was kind of a guilty pleasure for me. Bloody intense and great special effects. In short a great popcorn movie for any horror fan. Which brings us to The Hills have eyes 2 . Man where do I start? The plot or lack of one is paper thin. We are not exactly breaking new ground here.The military has decided to monitor the area and all of these people turn up missing. So what do we do now? Let's send in the National Guard to investigate. In true Hollywood fashion we need to make them the dumbest and worst soldiers ever seen. Gee I've never seen that premise before. To make a long story short you have the mutants killing off the moron soldiers one at a time in graphic fashion. Once again the special effects by Nicotero are great but the kills no matter how graphic become boring and predictable. Honestly it seemed to me that this flick was done just to grab a quick buck. It was bloody and graphic but I found it predictable boring and not scary at all. For me it would have been nice if this film contained one original thought.Wes Craven and his son shared the writing duties and he has been involved with many of my favorite horror films but sadly this isn't one of them. 
 AKA: Mondays In The Sun I have no idea what I just watched. Three men wander aimlessly and drink grousing about everything and at everyone in their path. This is supposed to be a drama but what it is is a total waste of film without a single redeeming quality. I have read reviews touting the performances herein as wonderful beautiful and heroic. I'm afraid I cannot agree unless these men were supposed to come off as the dumbest most ignorant proto-humans who ever walked. All in all? This was not a movie. It wanders throughout and loses everyone but the audience. I've watched this three times and cannot for the life of me see what anyone sees in this garbage. There is nothing profound here whatsoever. It's crap. It rates a ZERO/10 from... the Fiend :. 
 The Crater Lake Monster is easily one of the most awful amateurish film I've ever seen - ranking right up there with Manos the Hands of Fate in terms of poor acting useless direction and kindergarten-level production values. In this movie a silly-looking claymation/stop-motion animated dinosaur wakes up after a meteor hits a lake in Bumblebum CA and begins dining on the local hayseeds. In the thrilling climax the creature described by one local as a giant alligator with flippers drags it's ponderous bulk over the ground to chase its would-be lunch before a bulldozer bumps it a couple of times & it dies from boredom. Every character in this moovie is a complete moron. One pointless subplot shows a hick go into a liquor store to purchase a $4.75 pint of Ripple; instead of simply buying the bottle the idiot shoots the cashier and another bystander shoots at a cop gets chased towards the lake all so that he can eaten by the monster. Unfortunate close-ups of the monster reveal it to be nothing more than a piece of styrofoam. There's a fake magician struggling with a phony British accent (to make him seem more legit) two overly-bumbling redneck boat renters some cheesy pre-historic cave art done in crayon and annoying banjo-pickin' background moosic. In one painful scene the fake magician and his dopey wife/girlfriend/accomplice manage to pad the movie an extra 4 minutes by cowmenting on how may stars they can see in the night sky even though it is clearly day time still. Even on constant fast-forward this moovie hurts and hurts bad. MooCow says call the fumigators 'cause this cow pie really stinks! :=8P 
 This has to be one of the top overrated anime shows ever made. And yes I was even shown the End of Evangelion and that still made me hate it even more. Not to mention the countless rip-offs of this show! I don't mind psychological and philosophy untertones but Evangelion drags it out into the mud like nothing else! Not many of the characters seemed to be very interesting. The only ones that seemed to be interesting were Asuka Misato and Pen-Pen. Other than that mostly everyone else were a bunch of whiny crybaby losers. They need to go to a psyciatric center not piloting giant robots against aliens called Angels . Even the mecha and alien fights did not help at all. Goes something like this: Well there are these robots and they are really cool because they bleed(!) when they get hurt but they are not really mecha but captured angels so sometimes they go insane and don't do what the underaged pilots want and they have to be controlled better...blah blah blah! I am so sorry but I just cannot recommend Evangelion to anyone anime otakus or not. To those who love this series greatly fine you're entitled to that opinion I respect you. But to thoses that have a out of your mind obsession to think that every one will like this series you are more of an egotist. I prefer Macross Mospeada Run-Dim and Robot Taekwon V myself. 
 My title above says it all. Let me make it clearer. If you have seen the BBC's Planet Earth which I am sure most of you have then you are not gonna like this movie too much. And I own all the discs of Planet Earth I had seen the rating for this movie very high and read good reviews about it. I was excited to check it out. Alas I went to the theater and the movie started I saw it was a Disney movie with production companies listing BBC and Discovery. And when they started the first scenes about the polar bear I recognized them from my DVDs at home of Planet Earth . The movie continued and went on and on and on me and my friends kept on recognizing the scenes were all from Planet Earth . We were very very disappointed as I think 90% of the footage is from Planet Earth . I am saying 90% because some of the scenes I didn't recognize. I have a feeling that I simply didn't remember them. So finally what this movie really is is a compilation of different footages from the different discs of Planet Earth with a narration aimed at kids. Yes the narration is quite kiddish. Let me give you an example. When they show the polar cubs walking away from the mother cub the narrator says The polar cubs are not like human kids. They don't always listen to their mothers ( I don't remember the exact words but this is how it is ) So in a nutshell. This is condensed Planet Earth for kids ! 
 In addition to his Tarzan series the prolific Edgar Rice Burroughs did write many other books although aside from the popular At the Earth's Core few of these have been filmed. One exception is the novel entitled The Lad and the Lion brought to the screen as The Lion Man (1936) an over-talkative static old-hat slow-moving and rather dull movie despite being filmed on real desert locations. Actually movie is the wrong word. The narrative doesn't move but proceeds at a snail's pace in an abrupt series of jerks. For instance at least five characters are given elaborate opening scenes and then just disappear. Even more frustrating for the keen movie fan are the characters who make an impression of sorts (like the lass who plies Hall with drugged wine) but are enacted by players who are not credited! The credited thespians generally come off worse than the unknowns. One exception is Australian actress Finis Barton who gives a good account of the kidnapped harem girl who rescues young Master Fairy. Admittedly most of the cast are saddled with atrocious King James dialogue which has to be heard to be believed! But the way to play this rubbish is tongue-in-cheek a stratagem which does not seem to have occurred to a single one of the film's roster of no-talent players. Maybe director J.P. McCarthy scotched that idea. Anyway it's sad to see the lovely Kathleen Burke forced to trade lines with the likes of Richard Carlyle (her dad) and Jon Hall (her suitor). Admittedly Mr Hall delivers his lines with marginally more conviction than Mr Carlyle but that is no recommendation. 
 I had been subjected to this movie for a relationship class in my school. As figured it was nothing captivating and nothing new. Though it tries to be original by focusing on the teen father instead of the mother showing the problems that the dad would go through. It had an interesting side to it but it just doesn't live up to its originality due to the fact nothing else in this movie was original. We have the main character who has the older sister who like in every other movie like this has a thing against him we have the stay at home mother who expects too much and when he gives more she feels offended and leaves him in the dust then we have the father who is always gone. Then the girls side we have the parents who want everything and expect her to be perfect at all she does. On to the story like I said it was interesting but the lack of good acting from the entire cast and the lack of any good writing or storytelling. Everything about this fell into clich the little nerd kid in school starts studying with girl they get together have sex and then boom we have a little kid. Perhaps it could've been better had the writing been well better and had the acting been improved I've seriously gotten more emotion out of Leatherface and his chainsaw than I did out of any actor in this film and that's pretty bad seeing as the Leatherface movies are crap and horridly acted. So far the only interesting teen pregnancy movie I've seen was Juno. So far the comical side of this serious situation has proved more entertaining while still giving the same message. Like I said the idea was original most of these films focus on the teen mother but this one chose not to instead it focuses on the drama of the father but again the originality does not save this movie from mediocrity. I really hope someone decides to either re-make this movie with a better cast and a better writer or just make another similar film because this one was wasted potential. 
 This film was abysmal. and not in the good way as some have claimed. First off the main character is a very unattractive gingerman. Second - WTF is going on with this van love. The plot basically is: boy wants sex so buys a van (which in fairness is quite cool). Unbelievably given that he looks like a newt he scores with lots of chicks! And he fails with some. Then he scores with a really hot chick and realises he loves this dowdy bird who played hard to get. Then he drag races with the hot chicks boyfriend. And he tips his van. At which point danny devito saves the day. Although he didn't need to because in tipping the van the ginger kid crossed the line first. I gave this 2 *'s as i'm willing to assume that there's some sort of 70's Vanning subculture i'm not getting and also because there's some 70's boobage too. 
 I think it's time John Rambo move on with his life and try to put Vietnam behind him. This series is getting old and Rambo is no longer a solider but a cold blooded killer. Ever time he turns up on the screen someone dies. Vietnam was not a fun place to be and frankly I am tired of Hollywood making it seem like it was. This is not the worst of the films concerning Vietnam that honor goes to John Waynes Green Berets. In any case John Rambo carrying around a 50 cal Machine Gun taking on what seems to be half of the Viet Cong army plus a good many Russians is an insult to watch. What is worse is Rambos cheesy speech at the end...Please!! Oh yeah I heard they are making another one... 
 Nahhh! Leila (Grace Mills) is a teenager turned on to Satan (and LSD) by her archaeologist fianc Richard. There's a neighborhood hippie demon cult hanging out at the local decrepit ancient castle where Leila and Richard drink blood drop drugs join in sex orgies dance to lame psychedelic rock and participate in black mass ceremonies where the guys wear pants masks and capes and the women don't wear anything at all. Unfortunately these kind of extracurricular activities have left Leila open to demonic possession from the dreaded spirit of evil. Leila also comes from a screwed up family which doesn't help either. Her older brother John is a recluse who seems to be in love with her. Her mother Patricia (Maria Perschy) is depressed because she thinks she was responsible for the father's death. To top it off her sister (Maria Kosti) is a slutty semi pro golfer named (gasp!) Debbie Gibson. There's plenty of hired help around also to waste more time. Two maids (a young one who takes her clothes off a lot and an old one who spies on everyone) plus Udo (Luis Induni) a bald voyeuristic handyman who spies on Leila changing clothes takes nude pictures of her and sneaks into the pool house to take a sniff of her freshly used bathing suit. Oh yeah and Borg the pet German Shepherd. Paul Naschy is Father Adrian Dunning the doubting priest (zzzzz) who starts snooping around after John and Richard both have their heads twisted around backwards. Leila tells him They say I am perverse and I'm going to prove it is true! During her birthday party she tells her guests You make me sick! I hate you all! and when mom suggests having a doctor come over she she screeches I don't want to see that fat ass! Debbie suggests they commit Leila to a sanitory but Leila runs off and joins the cult again. She is rescued (again) and brought back home (for the third time). By this point in the movie there's only about ten minutes left to go and all we've basically seen is some very boring scenes of characters talking and whining about how terrible and f-ed up their lives are and how Leila is acting weird. It's almost as agonizing to sit through as an Andy Milligan movie minus the gore and laughs. But finally during the last few minutes we get the movie the title implies - an EXORCIST-like possession flick. Unfortunately the best part of it are the contact lenses Leila gets to wear. Some cheap time-lapse slashes appear on her arms legs and face she gets scabby lips and her eyes take on the appearance of blue and white marbles. She begins reeking of rotted flesh spits up some clear gunk starts speaking in her dead dad's voice sneaks into her mom's bedroom slaps her around a bit and calls her a filthy bitch of a whore. In comes Father Adrian who now finally believes she is indeed possessed fends off her attempts at seduction hallucinates frogs and eels are in the kitchen and douses Leila with holy water. Doors open and close a mirror breaks there's sudden thunder and her bed rises up off the floor. After she tackles Dunning and the two roll down the stairs the spirit is out of her and into - guess who? Why Borg the family pooch! The demon dog then turns on Adrian and chews him up a little before he impales it on a fire poker. Then we get one of the most irritating final shots ever committed to film. It's Leila on the floor going from her hideous appearance back to her normal sexy self. But then there's ANOTHER time-lapse effect that sort of seems to suggest that the demon has possibly reentered her body. It's so badly done you really have no clue what to make of it which is the final slap in the face to anyone who has just realized they've wasted an hour and a half on this worthless POS. Screw the contacts 1 out of 10 it is. 
 The statistics in this movie were well researched. There is no doubt about it! Al Gore certainly presents his case very well and it is no wonder that this movie got the praise that it got. Al Gore is certainly quite an actor. He sounds so concerned. But actions speak louder than words! Throughout this movie there are political tidbits and references to his political career sprinkled throughout the movie. Jimmy Carter unlike Al Gore is a man of integrity who not only talks the talk but walks the walk as well. When Carter thought we needed to conserve energy he turned down the thermostat in the White House and got warm by wearing a sweater. Al Gore tells us that we have to conserve energy and claims that we are creating global warming while he travels around in his own private jet. How much energy does his jet use and how much more pollution does his jet create? How much energy does it take to heat Gore's swimming pool behind his mansion? It would be nice if we could conserve electricity by using smaller appliances and making it a point to turn off anything that is not being used. But if we did the power company would react to a 50% reduction of energy by calling it a 50% loss in revenue and recouping their losses by raising the rates by 50%. So just turning it off would not be a very good idea. This movie is a veiled appeal to allow Big Goivernment to take control of everything in the name of saving planet earth that is. 
 The eight Jean Rollin film I have watched is also possibly the weirdest; the intriguing plot (such as it is) seems initially to be too flimsy to sustain even its trim 84 minutes but it somehow contrives to get inordinately muddled as it goes along! A would-be female vampire (scantily-clad as promised by the title) is held in captivity inside a remote chateau and emerges only to 'feast' on the blood of willing victims (who are apparently members of a suicide club) As if unsure where all of this would lead him the writer-director ultimately has the human villain ? actually the blank-faced hero's kinky father ? ludicrously revealed as a mutant(?!) from the future! The languorous pace and dream-like atmosphere (the cultists wear hoods and animal masks to hide their features from the sheltered girl) are of course typical of both the film-maker (ditto the seashore setting at the {anti}climax) and the Euro-Cult style as are the bevy of nubile beauties on display. Personally the most enjoyable thing about the whole visually attractive but intellectually vacuous affair was watching familiar character actor Bernard Musson (who appeared in six latter-day Luis Bunuel films) crop up bemusedly through it from time to time! 
 The 1990's begun to have day time talk shows sprout up left and right. Every network had one and they all lacked one thing Originality. Ricky Lake was just another show to entertain the obese trailer park mother with a Marlboro cigarette hanging out of her mouth while breast feeding one of her dozens of toothless illiterate children. The English language and other cornerstones of mankind where ruined by this shows existence. Titltes ranging from Girl you a Pigeon Head and so on. How could anyone want to watch this pure and utter garbage? Has our society really became nothing more than a bunch of hill billy's and dead beat fathers? The people who appear on this show were Trash. The people who watched this show were Trash. Anyone that wishes to see this show re aired or put onto DVD is TRASH. People wonder why Americans are becoming huge piles of lard and too fat to even get jobs its having shows like this tell them Its OK to be 500lbs overweight and have 12 year old girls act like prostitutes. Having such trash on TV has ruined morals. 
 You know that feeling of hilarity you get when you watch a film that's trying so hard to be a serious thought provoking piece of cinema and fails miserably? When you can't help but bust out laughing at the sheer terrible nature of the trash littering your screen? House of the Dead struggles to achieve even this low graded level of cinema. From start to end House of the Dead manages to recreate the feeling like you've just woken up to find out that the cat has laid it's curled business neatly on your forehead while you slept. It is clear from the start that the female actors have been cast for their cleavage size (which they exploit shamelessly) whereas the males for their hardcore kick-ass attitude. I honestly did not care any of the characters for any moment of the film and found myself actually wishing their demise so as to spare me a good hour of this torture. Uwe Boll should have considered screening two hours of footage from the actual game as a movie. At least then we'll get better acting? However not all blame can be placed on the actors as it is certainly a challenge to produce a convincing film when faced with the script of this film. It is arguably the worst section of the film and actually contains such lines as: These are zombies pure and simple and No cap'n we must not go there! It's evil! . We all know that Zombie movies are never going to be particularly thought provoking or full of meaning; at best they are a harmless two hours of action blood and closet terror. Trash yes but entertaining trash. Not the kind of trash which bursts out of your bin bag as you haul it across the room and smothers your shoes in sour milk cartons and decaying banana skins. According to IMDb House of the Dead received such bad reviews that no Danish cinemas bought the movie. If only we could have had the same privilege. Final Score: 1/10. 
 This review may contain some SPOILERS. Just when you thought they didn't make them so extremely bad anymore along comes Rae Dawn Chong as a space vixen and Willie Nelson as a Native American witchdoctor! It's even worse when you factor in that these two are the BETTER aspects of `Starlight ' a film that should only be viewed for laughs. Chong is an alien sent to Earth to seek out the only remaining half-breed part man and part alien. Apparently the Earth is in dire straits. Something is wrong with the genetics of mankind and in a few decades the world will be turned into a polluted wasteland. Only by duplicating the DNA of the half-breed can the kindly alien race save the planet. Don't ask me how that is since the movie gives the impression that the world will be destroyed by pollution which is caused by humans. You would think Earth could only be saved by getting rid of the polluting creatures not saving them! Anyway the half-breed turns out to be Billy Wirth a man living in a small Southwestern town and is part Native American from his mother's line despite the fact that his mother is a red-headed Caucasian and his grandfather is Willie Nelson. Wasn't this the sort of malarkey that made the bombastic Carmen Electra bomb `The Chosen One' such a howler? Chong arrives in her ship just as Wirth nearly drowns after driving his motorcycle into a lake in a fit of recklessness being the result of just breaking up with his girlfriend. Before you can say utter the word `hogwash ' Chong is revealing her secret to Wirth who isn't surprised for a moment and spreading the word to Wirth's family. Chong also makes pals with Wirth's mother who seems to have lost a few of her marbles over the years. Well this is because Wirth's father was an alien that abandoned her. Of course he is the standard rogue alien that has conveniently picked this moment to come to Earth for Wirth so he can use Wirth's DNA to make the people of Earth his slaves. (Huh?) His laughable attempts to use his telepathic powers and capture Wirth suck up most of the screen time and are the worst scenes in the movie. Not only are they boring but they are the scenes where you will be spotting the flubs the most. The ideas might be nice on paper but they are handled here with the utmost of stupidity particularly in the aforementioned scenes with the rogue alien. But the effects are the bane of the movie. The opening scene involves Chong on her spaceship communicating with her superior someone who we do not see but that Chong communicates with through a vat that emits pink light. They use no spoken words but telepathy so we are treated to subtitles. Trouble is both Chong and her superior's subtitles both look alike and the director gives you no indication as to which of the two are actually `speaking' at any given moment which makes the whole conversation nothing but gibberish. The spaceship is the worst effect to come out of Hollywood this side of an Ed Wood film. Now I am usually lenient on effects when dealing with a low budgeted film such as this but these effects really got to me. The most offensive was the most simple one: a fake night sky. The stars in the sky are so phony they almost sound off a dial tone. Most notably are the moments where Chong tells someone she comes from Pleiades and we get a shot of the seven stars. Thing is the seven stars take up about half the night sky in the movie but any stargazer knows that Pleiades is a star cluster between the constellations Perseus and Taurus and the cluster doesn't take up much room in the sky at all. These effects just get so lousy that your jaw will hang lower and lower with every passing moment. Be careful for it will go right through the floor during the finale when the effects have Willie Nelson turn into a human spotlight and . . . Oh it has to be seen to be believed! Starlight star bright; Last star I see tonight; I wish I might I wish I may; not have to watch any more of this trash today. Zantara's score: 1 out of 10. 
 I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Going Overboard is the single worst film i have ever seen and yes I have seen Cujo. Adam Sandler is an abomination as Schecky Moskowitz a wannabe comedian working on a cruise liner. That's the plot. That's it! Nothing else in the film makes sense it's all over the place like a mad man's breakfast and not in a wacky naked gun kind of way but more of a frustrating 'throw both shoes at the t.v' kind of way. even General Noriega makes an appearance for no reason i can comprehend (it certainly wasn't for humour). Add to the mix Miss Australia who has the worst Australian Accent i've ever heared and you have something which i won't call the worst film ever made because Going overboard doesn't even fit the basic definition of a film. I highly recomend seeing this film as it will elevate the standing of every bad film you ever see. I guarantee the first thing you'll say after seeing a bad film will be at least it wasn't as bad as Going Overboard . 
 The plot has already been described by other reviewers so I will simply add that my reason for wanting to see this film was to see Gabrielle Drake in all her undoubted glory. Miss Drake has to be one of the sexiest prettiest examples of posh totty to have been committed to celluloid. Of her era and ilk only the equally exquisite Jane Asher comes close. What was it about actresses with musical brothers? (Nick Drake and Peter Asher) For those who like me have admired Gabrielle her scenes in this movie will not disappoint. She has a magnificent figure and none of it is left to the imagination here. As a whole the movie is very poor and being of its time very cheaply made. The song that covers the opening credits seems to go on forever and is appalling. 
 Oh my god. the idea that this movie is a thriller is an absolute joke to me. besides the point that it seems to be written by a 5 year old. the plot the acting and even the props and filming of this movie were all beyond disgrace. I am not usually this critical about any movie cause every person has his/her style. But this movie however was probably the worst movie i have seen in 2008. I can honestly believe that this movie is unknown and i think it should stay like this for movies like these are making the thriller genre a joke. I advise anyone that is a fan of thriller movies or even simply movies to stay far away from this one. 
 If Ashanti had been a serious attempt at a film about the institution of slavery still prevalent in third world countries the film might have been better received. Instead it turns into a star studded disaster of a movie where the stars came in said their lines and picked up their paychecks without much conviction. Michael Caine and his wife Beverly Johnson work for the United Nations World Health Organization and are busy doing their humanitarian thing in East Africa. Along comes Peter Ustinov who can barely summon enough ham in him to make a go of the part as a Moslem slave dealer. As Johnson is black he grabs her anyway along with a lot of children and a few adults as well. Of course Caine doesn't take kindly to the kidnapping and the rest of the film is spent in a rescue attempt. The rest of the cast has such folks as William Holden Rex Harrison Omar Sharif and Indian film star Kebir Bedi in parts and looking so incredibly bored with the whole thing. Usually in something like this talented people like those mentioned above will just overact outrageously and feast on a diet of scenery. But Ashanti doesn't even have that going for it. What an incredible waste of time. The aroma of tax write off is permeating the air. 
 Buck's role as The Kahn brings to mind Bob Barker (of The Price is right) running a country the same way he runs his show. But there's lots more to chuckle and snort through in this turkey. Kurt Thomas as the baby-faced hero displays some considerable acrobatic skills but not a whit of acting talent whatsoever. There's a few spooky moments (in the Village of Crazies mostly) and some mildly impressive martial arts sequences. But any given Ninja movie will give you much more entertainment and you won't feel as guilty about laughing. 
 I never much liked the Myra movie tho I appreciate how it pushed the Hollywood envelope at the time. Certainly Miss Welch's costume became an iconic image though I have to wonder if many people who recognize the image really saw the film and know what it was all about - I rewatched Myra on FMC a couple of years ago and didn't think it had aged any better thru the years. There's a segment about it in the Sexploitation Cinema Cartoon History comic books where it's given proper credit for putting such big stars in what was then an outrageous production. However IMHO the movie is too bitter to be charming too silly to be a turn-on and so busy trying to shock that it fails to inform engage OR entertain --- 
 you must be seeing my comments over many films under Evren Buyruk ..I am off to make another comment over a movie that is not even worth a minute of talking though..This film is basically two hours of Dafoe's character drinking himself - nearly literally - to death. The only surprise in this film is that you didn't have enough clues or character knowledge to be surprised. It was just a grim sad waste of time. Willem Dafoe is excellent actor. Peter Stormare is an excellent actor. But this film just sucked. Slow doesn't make the movie bad it was just bad. The sketchy plot mixed with artistic ramblings of anamorphic detail aren't cohesively drawn together in a meaningful way for a plot except to highlight some gore which is illustrated from several perspectives finally at the end. I really appreciate the artistic vision but as entertainment it put me to sleep. (Seriously I fell asleep and had to re-watch the film - which was even more disappointing.) I generally don't like to make negative comments or reviews on the works of others even when they suck but this film warranted one. It's just too bad that these great actors were shamed with this end result. 
 Slashers.....well if you like horrors its definitely one to see otherwise don't even bother.It is completely obvious that this film has an extremely low budget For instance it looks as if the entire film has been shot in a warehouse somewhere and on numerous occasions you will see the mike boom shadow and the camera mans shadow trust me you wont need to look for them.Also try to ignore the cheesy actors if thats what you call them!!The basic outline is a few people decide to go on a game show where they have to survive a night in a big maze due to their being 3 killers on the loose and whoever live's at the end gets rich. Now there is something about this film that keeps you watching and rarely do you find that with a cheap budget horror these days For example when i watched it i thought to my self i would'nt mind having a go at this game! especially for $12.000.000. so anyway i would recommend you watch it and make up your own mind. 
 This is a great idea for a film but it unfortunately doesn't turn out to be a great movie. What starts out as a sweet and almost goofy romantic comedy about a Fluffer in love with his Fluffee spirals out of control into a bizarre combination of genres and a veritable stew of plots with liberal borrowings from BOOGIE NIGHTS THELMA AND LOUISE SHOWGIRLS FRISK and even a curious dash of 400 BLOWS thrown in towards the end. (At least the director did his research!) The result is not necessarily boring but in the end this slick well-produced flick doesn't quite add up to anything. However the actors all do a game job with the material and there are a few good laughs at the behind-the-scenes world of gay porn. 
 Very much a film from the times -- extremely long sequences with no dialogue bad flashbacks and an almost entirely male cast. The two women who appear have a total of under 10 lines and exist only as romantic interests for men. O'Toole is riveting whenever he speaks; unfortunately he spends much of his time peering through shrubbery. Alastair Sims is always a joy to see but he too is terribly underused. The film has one additional positive aspect in that it depicts many aspects of British fascism and fascist sympathies (such as the casual appearance of the Mosley graffiti) that many people today are unaware of. Too many of today's films about WWII paint the Allies as all-good and the Axis as all-evil when history tells us people are far more complicated than that! This would be a good movie for when you're recovering from the flu and are bundled on the couch and not able to absorb anything too complex. If you just need something to pass the time while your electrolytes stabilize this is the movie for you. 
 A fabulous book about a fox and his family who does what foxs do. that being stealing from farms and killing prey. until a trio of farmers decide they've had enough of this fox and try in various ways to have the problem solved . They are of course out foxed at every turn and while the trio are camped out at the fox hole the family perform raids against the three farmers land. The film version and I use the term film very loosely is more of a god awful pastiche of American heist movies particularly the Oceans movies. They they even have George clooney as Mr fox to to add to the insult and manage to miss the point of the story quite completely. So kudos to them .They'll make lots of money and destroy another classic Roald Dahl children book. 
 This movie was horrible. I watched it three times and not even the whole thing. It's just impossible to watch the story line sucks it's depressing and utterly disgusting. I don't write spoilers for anything so if you want to know why it's so disgusting see it for yourself. The only good thing about this movie was John Savage his dialogue at the beginning and some funny parts in the movie. The little kid in this movie is annoying and the whole situation is bullshit. I saw this movie at movie stores around America so I assumed it would be a good movie. Jesus Christ was I wrong!!!! The acting is all horrible and the nudity itself is lame and nasty. Another thing is Starr Andreef the other main character hasn't been in such bad movies in the past in fact she was in some pretty good ones. Same with John Savage. This movie SUCKS! 
 I am sad that a period of history that is so fascinating and so rich in material for film can be made into a ho-hum event . Wm C Quantrill was barely shown in the film probably the most intriquing figure of the period. Frank James was never mentioned Cole Younger ditto and Bloody Bill Anderson who would weep for his murdered sister every time he went into battle was completely absent in the script. Instead we were forced to watch fictitious characters that never developed into anyone we cared about. how sad. The costumes were wonderful however as was the location shooting in Missouri. I hope Ang Lee will make another film from the period and try again or some other film maker will look into the tremendous wealth of material to write a screen play on . 
 Trash/bad movies usually ain't bad because I will find them enjoyable. This one is so bad that I am out of words to describe it - its below bad . There is an instruction in the beginning of the film that tell you what to do during the movie. Needless to say the instruction and a dozen of beer couldn't help me seat through the entire film. One tagliner compares this one to KILLBILL which is certainly unthinkable and an insult to our intelligent. Obviously. this tagliner had a plan to tempt you into buying this DVD. If you are considering renting this one put it down! If you are thinking of buying Dont think! If you unlucky to have this dvd dont play it throw it in trash bin immediately. 
 Johnny Weissmuller's final film as 'King of the Jungle' after 16 years in the role TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS is bound to disappoint all but the most ardent of his fans. At 44 the ex-Olympian one of Hollywood's most active 'party animals' was long past the slim athleticism of his youth and looked tired (although he was in marginally better condition than in his previous entry TARZAN AND THE HUNTRESS). Not only had Weissmuller gotten too old for his role; Johnny Sheffield the quintessential 'Boy' had grown to manhood (he was a strapping 17-year old) so he was written out of the script under the pretext of being 'away at school'. Brenda Joyce at 35 was appearing in her fourth of five films as 'Jane' (she would provide the transition when Lex Barker became the new Tarzan in 1949's TARZAN'S MAGIC FOUNTAIN) and was still as wholesomely sexy as ever. Produced by Sol Lesser at RKO on a minuscule budget the cast and crew took advantage of cheaper labor by filming in Mexico. While the location gave a decidedly Hispanic air to what was supposedly darkest Africa veteran director Robert Florey utilized the country extensively incorporating cliff diving and an Aztec temple into the story. When a young island girl (Tyrone Power's future bride Linda Christian) is rescued in a jungle river by Tarzan he learns that a local high priest (George Zucco one of filmdom's most enduring villains) had virtually enslaved the local population threatening retribution from a living 'God' if they don't do his bidding. The girl had been chosen to become the 'God's' bride so she fled. Faster than you can say 'Is this a dumb plot or WHAT?' the girl is kidnapped by the priest's henchmen and returned to the island and Tarzan followed by Jane colorful Spanish character 'Benjy' (charmingly played by John Laurenz who sings several tunes) and a government commissioner are off to take on the Deity and his priest (poor Cheeta is left behind). After a series of discoveries (the 'God' is simply a con man in an Aztec mask working with the priest in milking the island's rich pearl beds) a bit of brawling action and comic relief and songs by Benjy everything reaches the expected happy conclusion. Remarkably TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS features a musical score by the brilliant film composer Dimitri Tiomkin and is far better than what you'd expect from this 'B' movie! While the film would provide a less-than-auspicious end to Weissmuller's time in Tarzan's loincloth (he would immediately go on to play Jungle Jim a more eloquent variation of the Ape Man in khakis) the talent involved lifted the overall product at least a little above the total mess it could have been. Tarzan was about to get a make over and become much sexier... 
 I only hope that no classicists/ancient historians saw Cleopatra or if they did that they took it as a laugh. The movie is horrendously inaccurate more laughably even than Gladiator (which is at least a well-written script whose historical errors are articulate and correspond well to the story). Most blatant is Octavius Caesar's heir in the Senate before Caesar's assassination: at the ripe old age of 19! Besides this the acting is mediocre. Timothy Dalton has more than a hint of James Bond in him when he says Caesar. Julius Caesar. Billy Zane is a laughably dense Marc Antony. And Leonor Varela tries her best to be the seductive Pharaoh (who in real life was not good-looking at all) but comes off as unbelievable. So this is a warning for all historians--this movie is not true to life! 
 F*ck Me! I've seen some incredibly horrific movies in my time but this takes the p*ss! Honestly I can't express in words how bad this film actually is. Besides the plot that isn't really there the comically crap acting the hilariously dreadful excuses for zombies; You know what I could go on all day. Every little thing in this film is either stupid pointless crap or embarrassing. I express to anyone who wants to watch this movie... don't! I'm ashamed to say I have this on my rack. It's hidden away right at the god damn bottom of the huge pile. I couldn't even give this horse-sh*t excuse for a film away. That's how bad it is. 
 Philip. K. Dickian movie. And a decent one for that matter. Better than the Paycheck (Woo) and that abomination called Minority Report (Spielberg). But lets face it the twisting and cheesing ending was a bit too much for me. Half way through the movie I already started to fear about such kind of ending and I was regrettably right. But that does not mean that the film is not worth its time. No not at all. First half (as already many here have commented) is awesome. There are some parts where you start to doubt whether the director intended to convey the message that showmanship is highly important thing in the future (we will do such kind on corny sf things because we CAN) or is it simply over combining. But the paranoia is there and feeling out of joint also. Good one. 
 I think that deep down in the darkest slimiest part of their heart everyone likes Jerry Springer just a little bit. While his show is undeniably offensive and stupid it also gives us a chance to see that relatively speaking most of us have it real good. When you look at the trailer park livin' dollar whiskey drinkin' incest lovin' people on the Springer show it makes even your worst day seem like a walk in the park. Jerry is performing a public service and we should be grateful. He ditched a political career to host the show just for us. What we should not be grateful for in any way is the piece of garbage movie Ringmaster . Ringmaster shows what life is like for people who wind up being guests on the show or so they would like us to think. The movie follows the pre-requisite Springer story line: Love triangles. One triangle involves Connie her daughter Angel and her husband Rusty. The other involves Starletta Vonda and Demond. When the two hapless groups meet up in LA their lives intertwine and collide head-on all culminating in an explosive episode of the Springer show. It's like what Short Cuts would be if Robert Altman had had a severe crack habit. Ringmaster is true to the show as it is stupid and offensive from start to finish. It also makes me very glad that I don't live in the squalor it's characters do. But the movie has a problem. It's billed as a comedy but it just isn't very funny. What laughs there are to be had are few and far between. Maybe some people watch this and laugh non-stop. If you think blow jobs and rape are funny well then I guess you're one of those folks. Personally I laughed two or three times and spent the rest of the movie in utter awe of the agonizing horrors of white-trash life. The Jerry Springer Show just isn't meant to make the leap from TV to the silver screen. What's funny in an hour long show (less when you count commercials) isn't necessarily going to be funny in a ninety minute movie. Movies have to tell a story and that's something else Ringmaster has trouble with. The story is threadbare. There are so many plot holes and continuity errors that any attempt at telling a cohesive narrative is quickly put asunder. And even if there weren't such problems how much fun can you pull out of a story of stereotypical people in a stereotypical story? Even the Hollywood formula couldn't make this better. Ringmaster: is so bad it even screws up the best part of the Springer show: the Final Thought. Somehow even the smartest and simplest aspect of the show wound up blowing harder than the slutty women the film is built around. The worst offender in all of this is Springer himself. He's such a bad actor that he can't even play himself convincingly. Watching Springer play Springer is sad. It's like he was going for a 'What if Woody Allen played Jerry Springer' vibe and he failed. Miserably. He went to the trouble of producing this disaster the least he could do is try to make it just that much better. Not that I'm saying everyone else in this movie put in an award worthy performance. Just the opposite. They all suck. Not so surprisingly no one in this movie went on to greatness. The best any of them was did was Molly Hagan landing a job on a Nickelodeon sitcom. Apparently Nickelodeon has no problem with hiring a woman who starred in the most vile film of the '90's to star in a children's program. It makes you wonder what kind of things the other adults on that channel have done in their pasts. Here are my Final Thoughts: What we have here is a group of people with no self respect and a man with money to burn who have met and put their resources together to produce a film that shows how much they hate themselves and how little they think of the intelligence of their viewing audience. Should we accept people who make movies that treat us like severely brain-damaged lumps of goo? I say no. Somewhere out there in this crazy mixed up world there is a perfect movie for each of us. We just have to keep looking for it. Until next time take care of yourselves and your loved ones. And don't ever watch Ringmaster . 
 I found this a good movie to pass your time but not by any chance of any historical value. The portrayal of Cleopatra reminded me a cheap soap opera. The twist of the facts is... funny! She gave birth while feeding her people!?!? O please... A pregnant Queen of Egypt (especially this one) would not bother to go from one room to the other for that reason! They tried to make her appear a saint for God's sake! And the way they tried to justify her murdering her own sister... beyond description. Cleopatra was the greatest politician of her time. Her decisions were based anything but her feelings and morals. She did everything for only two reasons: Power and self-preservation! She was borne in a family where she had to straggle for survival something she did very well. Anything that stood on her way was either murdered (her brothers and sister) or seduced (Ceasar and Mark Anthony). Unfortunately Octavian was too powerful to kill and too... gay to be seduced. So he was her end... 
 I can count (on one hand) the number of good movies starring Joe Don Baker. This is not one of them. Interminable chase scenes dim-witted dialogue and terrible lapses in continuity made this movie a prime choice for getting the send-up on MST3K. And that is the only way I was able to watch this... 
 We have an average family. Dad's a famous rapper we have the rebelious teenage daughter the adopted white kid and the cute little kid. And we have careless housemaid what show has had a housemaid like that? Do we have a messed-up Brady Bunch? Yay! When it first came out I thought it was really cool mostly because I was young. The music was bad. The raps were so bad and they were too g-rated. All of his raps were about his family and friends and problems. The dad was kind of the Danny from Full House type of dad. Always gave the advice out. But he wasn't a clean freak. They had a house-keeper for that. Remember? The plots were basically Lil' Romeo was in trouble of some sort or... not that's it. Oh and maybe some preteen drama. Yeah that stuff is good. Not really. But its still a good show for kids. But Nikelodean could do better. 
 Why is it that any film about Cleopatra the last phaoroh brings out the worst in movie making? Whatever attraction the woman had for the greatest Roman of them all Julius Ceasar and his successor Mark Anthony never seems to come across on the screen as other than the antics of over sexed high school seniors. Despite lavish sets and costumes this movie is as bad as any Italian sandals and toga extravaganza of the 50's. Admittedly this kind of spectacular belongs on the big screen which is why Gladiator went over well but Gladiator did not have all the romance novel sex. Miss Varela has as little acting talent as Elizabeth Taylor but Timothy Dalton has talent to spare. Pity some of it didn't wash off on the others. 
 Why oh why can't anyone make a decent film out of a legendary tale? This is the second adaptation of Beowulf I've been disappointed with in a year. But I have to say the previous version ( Beowulf & Grendel starring Gerald Butler) was far superior to this. That one was only a little disappointing. This one is a mess!!! What bugged me most? Was it the useless plot elements they added in for no particular reason (Human sacrifices? Pointless love interest?) or the bad CGI or the inconsistency of the characters or the uninspired acting? Even worse was the way they made beautiful Marina Sirtis look so horrible!!! And lets not even talk about that ridiculous crossbow? And why did they continually remind us that Beowulf had the strength of 30 men and yet he never showed the slightest sign of such strength throughout the entire film. He was tossed around by both monsters he fought relying on his sidekicks to save his bacon. Even when he slugged the arrogant prince he didn't knock him out. He was much too reliant on weapons. Beo-wimp is more like it. This was certainly not the powerful Beowulf of the epic poem! I'd like to end this on a positive note but I can't really think of one offhand. All I can say is if you've ever read Beowulf you'll be infinitely disappointed by this dismal inaccurate excuse for an adaptation! 
 i've seen a movie thats sort of like this were a transsexual drugs woman and he then picks there nose with a knife and rips there nose to peaces. he then slices there tongue and eats it. the most gruesome part of the movie is were he cuts there left eye out and starts dancing with it. he then starts to eat the woman naked. (i'm not sure what the movies called but i know it's a cult movie and that it was made in Germany). anyway THE NOSE PICKER is fairly crap. its a crap movie and the picture and volume quality is very rubbish. please don't waste you're time buying and watching this movie its totally crap. i prefer DAY OF THE WOMAN also known as I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (its one of the best cult movies ever) check out this link http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077713/ 
 'Ninteen Eighty-Four' is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and no one can be trusted. It is a very dark film and it is one that will not make you feel good about yourself. It is about a romance taking place in this society and the betrayal of the lovers and about human nature being self-centred. The film has some very good ideas and is done well in portraying this society with the dark tones in colours (contrasting with happiness and bright colours in the dreams) and a general feeling of loneliness through objects and people and places. However despite the film's cleverness at portraying this idea the film was very slow and did not seem to quite get the idea across. It seemed to spend too much time being clever rather than telling a story. 
 Everyone else who has commented negatively about this film have done excellent analysis as to why this film is so bloody awful. I wasn't going to comment but the film just bugs me so much and the writer/director in particular. So I must toss in my hat to join the naysayers. I saw the original Wicker Man and really loved the cornucopia of music sensuality paganism in a modern world and the clash of theological beliefs. This said I am not part of the crowd that thinks remakes of great movies shouldn't be done. For example I liked the original 1950's Invasion of the Body Snatchers but equally enjoyed the 1978 remake. Both films can stand on their own. Another example is The Thing . The original as campy as it looks compared to today's standards has a lot to be proud of in the 1982 remake with Kurt Russell (my all time favorite horror movie). So that small minority of people who like The Wicker Man re-make can not accuse me of dissing this piece of crap just because it's a re-make. This film solidified for me Neil LaBute's sexism and misogynistic tendencies. It also made me wonder how executives wanting to make a serious thriller would green light a product that is so anti-female. There are too many scenes of Cage hitting women just because he's frustrated with them thwarting his investigation of a missing girl. would he react like this off the island in other cases where suspects aren't forthcoming? The original created a society in which men and women are equal participants in a Goddess based religion. The threat to the main character came from everyone male and female. There was no sexual hierarchy. The metaphor of bees drones etc was a bit heavy handed and convenient ( The drone must die! ) especially when Cage's character has bee allergies. I kept wondering why the men on the island didn't fight back and use mere physicality to stop these women from treating them like grunts. These were not women with special supernatural powers and half of them seemed to be pregnant the other half old and fat and the rest girls and thin blonde waifs so if the men really wanted to escape they could do what most men do when they hate women. Physically dominate them. There didn't seem to be any guns or weapons beyond cutting tools to hold them if they were unhappy. But if they were content being drones why make them unable to speak? They could be used as a threat to Cage because they will defend the community. They are drones because Neil LaBute seems to believe that a society ran by women would leave men castrated. (That movie was made already. The Stepford Wives anyone?) Classic symptoms from men who are afraid of what may happen if women got their sh*t together and were truly equal citizens. The problem with the man-hating female society is that it makes uninteresting movie viewing and creates unintentional humor when Cage starts knocking women out. I belief LaBute should've left the society an egalitarian one kept the sexuality and uninhibited lasciviousness and pushed buttons of discomfort in regards to the children on that island. No one likes pedophiles or children to be sexually exploited. So how would a cop react if he saw lewd acts performed by adults with children around? There would be a logical mental leap that these children are abused thus an urgency created to save the missing child and get help for all the children. LaBute has said he created the fianc and daughter story thread to give Cage's character an incentive to search. I don't think you need that. Any child abused will make an adult react to save them. The irony of course would be that the child Cage saves ultimately brings him death. The dialogue was contrived and campy. The whole third act was hilarious. The audience I saw it with guffawed (and later booed at the end). I just thought the movie started off wrong when the letter arrived written in the fancy handwriting and all the flashbacks cutting into to show how wounded Cage is. We don't need that. Just show him arriving on the island for an investigation of a missing child. Most of us in America have seen Law & Order and other cop procedurals. We come into the movie as if we are Cage's partner solving a mystery. So much potential...wasted. Neil LaBute stick to talking head pictures for people who enjoy your male angst-ridden plays and flicks of that sort. Stay with your own company of men. Leave the thrillers for people who understand thrillers. Here is your jar of honey. I'll watch that. 
 This seemed to be a good movie I thought it would be a good movie and throughout the movie I was hoping it would be a meaningful use of my time and yes I have to admit that the acting talent of Dimple Kapadia and Deepti Naval where truly commendable but despite the best effort this movie falls short of effectively conveying a meaningful message which it seems is it seemed was what Somnath Sen is trying to do. The final point comes short and the ending seemed kind of unsatisfactory after all that happens; a bit like real life in that respect but movies unlike real life ends in about 2hrs and the ending should leave the audience satisfied if indeed that was the director's intention. This falls short in that respect and that is what disappoints me the most. Another aspect that concerned me was the national stereo-typing of the American characters - they all seem to be carved out of the same block. Seems to me that most American characters in Indian English movies are based upon how common Indians themselves perceive Americans to be like and it is clear that no effort has been made to bring any sense of depth or complexity to any American in the movie. These two aspects put together they make for a disappointing story. 
 Well no not really. Its not really a good movie but its not as bad as I thought it was going to be. I really didn't feel ripped off of my rental money and sometimes thats all you can ask for. The plot is OK nothing brilliant or new the acting is pretty bad but the cast is pretty. The directing is passable but the effects are horrible especially the werewolf effects which in a werewolf movie is a pretty big problem. There was a fairly decent amount of nudity which to me is a pretty good thing but it wasn't all that hot. All in all its a fairly average direct to video movie not the worst film I've ever seen and if you're bored a genre fan check it out sometime. I'd even watch it again. Bonus fact for horror geeks Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in a few of them) plays the werewolf. 
 Gee what a heck of a movie!... I said I wanted to become a specialist in bad movies from all decades so I decided to start by this one. It was a pretty adequate choice. I entered this adventure to find some lost gems and uncomprehended masterpieces but I didn't see anything of the sort in this pastel-coloured mess. I haven't really watched many bad films before but I've got the feeling this is what's called so bad that's good probably because it is so unintentionally damn funny! First of all there are the inaccuracies. There are plot-related inaccuracies physical inaccuracies and also psychological inaccuracies. The latter in particular are as insane as Van Damme's ass cheeks inside that blue spandex. Extremely tacky lines exist too and I won't even start to talk about some of the hilarious action moves. There isn't exactly bad acting from everyone involved in that hot mess of a movie except in one particular case. Geoffrey Lewis looks completely pathetic as Frank which is an utterly stupid character. And to tell the truth I was actually very surprised to see that Van Damme did a decent job playing the twins. He succeeded in achieving a different tone and mood in the two roles that was convincing to me. But the movie was mostly very bad and the sad part is that it was produced by a major motion picture studio... which is now bankrupt. 
 I really looked forward to see Planet of the Apes but it was a huge dissapointment. The settings and masks are great but that is the only good aspect of the film. All other things are really annoying. Mark Wahlberg is not acting he is just in the movie looking stupid. The other actors are also not very good. But the worst point of all is the story. It is absolutely ridiculous! For example: the apes are lying unconsiousness on the ground but the humans don`t attack them no they wait until they are up again! This is just one example for the stupid story but it would take too long to tell them all. 
 If movies like Ghoulies rip off Gremlins then Hobgoblins sinks to the new low of ripping off garbage like Ghoulies. These barely-animated furbies have some kind of scheme to fulfill fantasies (which involve basically groteque characters' sex dreams - oh joy) but what that has to do with anything is anybody's guess except to let the director indulge his kinky penchant for erotica. They show this down in the 8th circle of Hell one suspects. There's no real plot - just goblins - kill! and feeble attempts at humor and a mild attempt to arouse the viewing audience. 
 A friend once asked me to read a screenplay of his that had been optioned by a movie studio. To say it was one of the most inept and insipid scripts I'd ever read would be a bold understatement. Yet I never told him this. Why? Because in a world where films like While She Was Out can be green-lighted and attract an Oscar- winning star like Kim Basinger a screenplay lacking in character content and common sense is no guarantee that it won't sell. As so many other reviewers have pointed out While She Was Out is a dreadfully under-written Woman-in-Peril film that has abused housewife Basinger hunted by four unlikely hoods on Christmas Eve. Every gripe is legitimate from the weak dialog and bad acting to the jaw-dropping lapses of logic but Basinger is such an interesting actress and the premise is not without promise. Here are a couple of things that struck me: 1) I don't care how much we are supposed to think her husband is a jerk the house IS a mess with toys. Since when did it become child abuse to make kids pick up after themselves? 2) Racially diverse gangs are rare everywhere except Hollywood where they are usually the only racially balanced groups on screen. 3) Sure the film is stupid. But so are the countless thrillers I've sat through where the women are portrayed as wailing helpless victims of male sadism. Stupid or not I found it refreshing to see a woman getting the best of her tormentors. 4) I LOVED the ending! 5) Though an earlier reviewer coined this phrase I really DO think this film should be retitled The Red Toolbox of Doom.  
 As said before the visual effects are stunning. They're breathtaking. I personally use Blender and graphics like that are not easy AT ALL. But that's all this movie is. Not only is the plot confusing but the overall conflict is not clear. For example in the first scene Proog and Emo are trying to run away from who knows what. The conflict seems to be between man and nature here. Later when they enter the room of the bottomless pit Proog explains that one step out of place and (you're dead) . Here there's a more precise conflict between the careless man and nature. As the movie progresses it's clear that a conflict exists between man and nature. But suddenly a conflict exists between man and man when Proog out of nowhere murders Emo. Proog immediately changes from being a caring guardian looking after a lost child to being a sick man . He betrays us. Not only is this depressing but we don't care because the conflict between the character's thoughts and actions is not developed. It's not a story about someone through struggle emerging stronger. It's depressing and has not point because there's no great truth about the human soul or about the world brought to light like a great drama does. In my opinion the movie is severely underdeveloped in all aspects. However the graphics are stunning but a movie is so much more than mere eye candy. There's no truth no struggle and a bad surprise ending. In conclusion an underdeveloped movie without a point. ...but the graphics are good. 
 I remember the days in which Kim Basinger was nothing more than a pretty face who adorned movies with typical characters of dumb Blondie romantic interest or damsel in danger.But everything changed when she won an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress for her role in the excellent movie L.A. Confidential and I think I was not the only one who was surprised by her solid performance.However after that moment her career did not follow the ideal path.Sure the prestige she won thanks to that movie made her to participate on moderately prestigious movies (like People I Know or The Door in the Floor) but we have never seen her again on a substantial character.The movie While She Was Out does nothing to put her on that situation; and it is not only that her character is not too tasty but also that the movie is really crappy.The screenplay from this movie could not be more hollow and basic.However Basinger brings some conviction to her character and that makes this poor movie to win a few points.This movie is full of clichs and generic villains.The work of director Susan Montford is truly disastrous for many reasons but mainly because the movie never gets a good rhythm and tone.The ending from this movie is extremely ridiculous.I do not recommend While She Was Out at all.This film commits the capital sin of being boring. 
 As far as I can understand TIW WATCHER is the first work of a young director. My doubt is if this is the work of a regular guy who happens to love films or if this is the work of a cinema student since there is a reference to Oporto School of Arts in the final credits. Nevertheless director Ricardo Pinho demonstrates with this movie a total unawareness of some basic notions about cinema. What is a movie? How to tell a story? It doesn't matter for the novice director. One of the first things you learn in school when you're studying cinema is how to tell a story. You learn that just like in novels in movies you should also construct your story in three acts: the introduction the development and the conclusion. You learn that your story should have a protagonist and an antagonist and that there should be a climax. You learn this is valid for a 3-hour-epic for the regular movie for a short film and even believe it or not for a 30-second commercial. You also learn there can be levels of subtleness in your approach to the academic structure and that ultimately you can even deconstruct it. In rough terms TIM WATCHER introduces us its main character and then the movie ends - the whole movie sounds like the introduction of the characters in Jeunet's AMLIE. There are no second or third acts in TIM WATCHER. This is not a parody or an art film thus you can't even try to justify the disrespect for the academic structure. You are expecting to be told a story and it doesn't happen. Worst than that TIM WATCHER defines itself as a warning; and one with no real purpose. It doesn't make a point or at least not a valid one. Its point is childish with a sense of vengeance. The situations portrayed are utterly simple and its approach is Manichaean. I was expecting a lot more from this short. The movie opens with a rather good-looking credits sequence and you quickly realize you are watching something with better production values than the regular Portuguese short film. I don't know the budget for this movie but judging for the thanks-list in the end credits merit must go to the production team for such good connections in a country where's difficult to have doors opened to young filmmakers. TIM WATCHER seems to be an exercise in style color and carefully chosen plans combined with a fine score. That's all. There's nothing else. There's no plot. And that's a shame because it feels like a waste of production values. Hardly you can see in the regular Portuguese short such diversity of locations and so many available extras to enrich a story. As absurd as the comparison may sound I must refer the BMW shorts as a fine example of how you can tell a good story in a very short film severely conditioned to product placement and over-the-top stylish cinematography. 
 Not the worst movie I've seen but definitely not very good either. I myself am a paintball player used to play airball a lot and going from woods to airball is quite a large change. The movie portrays similar qualitys First of all the movie starts off with this team that apparently is trying to shoot this Phantom guy or whatever they appear to be a professional team and wear jerseys and shoot mags autocockers. One guy sporting a bushy. Not much wrong with the movie but more how it's perceived it was very cheesy. A bunch of kids who are the good guys are woodsball players who don't appear to have much money and have dreams of getting better guns . Another team constantly picks on them and insults them because they play woods and blah blah blah The phantom helps these woodsball kids out and trains them and all this crap he gets them to play airball and basically defeats all the teams including the professionals . So what exactly is wrong with the movie? Well the budget is a huge thing a paintball movie WOULDN'T be bad but the budget is pretty low and the movie feels like it was done by an amateur. There are no big names in this film and the acting is very cheesy. The perception of paintball is pretty bad too. They seem to imply that everyone is going to speedball and all this other crap. It just was a lousy movie in my opinion and doesn't give a real perception what paintball is. To be honest real paintball isn't all buddy like it's a lot of cussing and bonus balling not respect and playing by the rules. Don't watch this movie and then expect to go to a field screaming 4 is 1!!  
 This film is pretty poor. The acting is abysmal and completely forced. Furthermore by shooting the film as a docudrama doesn't necessarily make it more believable you can't get out of it that easily Mr Dir. Don't let my comments mislead you however as i would recommend you watch this film as it does shed some light on the psychology or non existent psychology behind the perpetrators of such crimes. However the climax of the film is absolutely rubbish! There is no other way to put it! It pure and simply fails to capture any sense of atmosphere! What takes place does not translate to me any feelings of desperation panic fear or dread that one would surely experience in such terrifying circumstances. No instead it leaves you with jaw dropping Was that it?! spilling from your tongue and by no means are you haunted by these boys actions. Rather you just feel embarrassed for yet another film that started with potential but ended up falling flat on its face at the most crucial point.Zero Day indeed....zzzzzzzzzzzzz 
 Sixth escapade for Freddy Krueger in which he has finally managed to kill off virtually every youth in Springwood; now he wants to broaden his horizons and (**SPOILER**) needs a family member in order to do it. A failure as a horror movie because it simply ain't scary at all. Works better as a dark macabre black comedy to tell you the truth. Freddy Krueger has now been stripped of all of his ability to chill this viewer. (Too many wisecracks that's for sure.) The actors aren't interesting (save Robert Englund as always and an obviously slumming Yaphet Kotto) and there are simply far too many visual effects. The finale is OK but doesn't provide as many sparks as I think one might hope. In adding a new twist to the familiar dream killer's story it provides Englund the opportunity to do more non-makeup scenes than ever before. There are cameos worth noting: a joint cameo by then-couple Roseanne and Tom Arnold that is devoid of entertainment value an appropriate appearance by veteran shock-rocker Alice Cooper and a funny cameo by Johnny Depp that also sort of acknowledges the pop icon that he had become. Film debut of Breckin Meyer who plays Spencer. One of the best things about it is the replaying of key scenes from earlier entries during the closing credits. 4/10 
 I see where a few people involved in this debacle wrote reviews to share their side of the story and I thought what they wrote was helpful in understanding it. The fact that they basically came up with excuses -- rewrites budget constraints production formats etc -- simply underlines how bad this movie is. And my criticisms in panning it are not personally directed but simply a warning that this one doesn't make the cut. It's watchable but barely so. There are plot holes in every corner the dialogue borders on the ridiculous and the ending is telegraphed a mile away. The modestly interesting feature of a hologram interacting with a recon team get drowned in silly dialogue like who makes a meal in the midst of what is supposed to be a tense and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy. Would ya wrassle us up some Hamburger Helper Sally between us getting killed by these automated carpet sweepers? Apparently this elite team equipped with the latest gizmos and red plastic tubed wonder armor has no access to MREs. Once they get into the last rooms they treat the place more like a four star motel than a deadly encounter zone. The rationale for the encounter with the fearsome Rook is that it can't be killed single handedly. Yet only one scene ago the hero making that case abandoned King to do exactly that. Huh? Vivian Woo was attractive and hands down the best acted character in the movie. But that's not saying much. 
 I was so looking forward to seeing this when it was in production.But it turned out to be the the biggest let down. A far cry from the whimsical world of Dr Seuss. It was vulgar and distasteful I don't think Dr Seuss would have approved.How the Grinch stole Christmas was much better. I understand it had some subtle adult jokes in it but my children have yet to catch on. Whereas The Cat in the Hat screamed vulgarity they caught a lot more than I would have liked.Growing up with Dr Seuss It really bothered me to see how this timeless classic got trashed on the big screen .Lets see what they do with Horton hears a who.I hope this one does Dr Seuss some justice. 
 I read Rice's novel with interest and became quite enchanted with its characters and heartbreaking tale based on historical truths. However I was simply APPALLED at this disastrous adaptation. The casting was based merely on physical appearance and not acting talent (with the obvious exception of Peter Gallagher who was neither blond-haired or able to act his way out of a wet paper bag). The cast's embarrassingly clumsy and inconsistent attempts at affecting a French accent was hilarious but not in an entertaining way. I found myself wincing through this muddled and melodramatic tripe and was surprised I made it to the end. A warning to fans of the novel - stay away from this one. 
 This movie isn't about football at all. It's about Jesus/GOD!! It's the same kind of sappy sanctimonious religious drivel you get from those arch idiots who wrestle for Jesus or pump iron for Jesus. Yeah Jesus was totally buffed liked contact sports and definitely owned a full set of dumb bells. DUHHH! This movie should have been entitled Hiking for Jesus or something along those lines just to let the general public know that the real intent of this movie is to convert people to Christianity and to pander to those whose brains have already been thoroughly washed in the blood of the lamb. That the title is derived from the Bible is made clear when the head coach is reading his Bible and asking Jesus for help. The recent sports movie Invincible was 100 times more inspiring than this was and Jesus wasn't even a factor. It was just the desire and determination of an individual with a dream. Any broad appeal as an inspirational sports movie is ultimately lost amidst all of the blatant Bible thumping and sanctimonious religious propaganda. One gets the impression that the sole message is the only way you can succeed and make positive gain is if you accept Jesus as your personal savior. But this is simply not true and is therefore a lie being perpetuated by those who believe that it is true and want everyone else to believe it. The image of the winning athlete thanking Jesus when he wins comes directly to mind. What does he do when he loses? Does he curse Jesus? Of course not! When he loses Jesus isn't responsible. Jesus is only responsible when he wins. And the logic goes round and round and round and it ends up exactly where the true believer needs it to be every time!! I had to hit pause when the scene with the coach receiving a brand new truck came on so I could stop rolling on the floor laughing my ass off and catch my breath. Materialism is not what Jesus taught. I find it odd that most so called Christians seem to either forget or ignore this message from their savior especially when I see a Jesus fish on the back of a huge gas guzzling SUV that passes me like I'm standing still. Another message this movie implies is that Jesus apparently cares more about the win loss record of a mediocre high school football team that he does about the millions of starving children in the world. The final scene where the insecure and unsure kicker boots a 51 yard field goal and it is hyped up as an unbelievably incredible miracle puts the final gag me with a spoon religious red flag on this turkey. I only gave it three stars because the guy who played the black coach could actually act. 
 this one of the best celebrity's reality shows a ever saw. we can see the concerts we can see the life of Britney i love the five episodes. i was always being surprised by Britney and the subjects of the show i think that some people don't watch the show at all we can how a great person she his. she his really funny really gentle and she loves her fans and we can see how she loves her work. i just don't give a 10 because of k-fed he his a real jerk he doesn't seem to like Britney at all. I they make a second season of this great show because it shows at some people how Britney really is. Go Britney your the best and you will never leave our hearts. 
 This movie has not aged well. Maybe it's just the impact and artful characterization acting and directing that we've seen with The Sopranos but I just viewed Prizzi's Honor for the first time on DVD alone. The experience of watching it with an audience 24 years ago must have been quite different but I have to say I was just appalled at the ending. Not just the violence of it but the mere idea that somehow this would be a satisfying ending. I enjoy a good shocker but this seemed so out of character... Also when was this move supposed to be set? The cars all seemed like they were from the 1960s and yet the World Trade Center towers {completed in 1973} were clearly visible in many cityscape scenes. Another way in which the film has aged poorly is the mere idea that a passenger could travel coast to coast with a knife on his person. Somehow mid-1980s audiences found this film charming and funny. Mid-eighties meet the late oughts: only of you can live. 
 When we were in junior high school some of us boys would occasionally set off stinkbombs. It was considered funny then. But the producers directors and cast of Semana Santa ( Angel of Death in the DVD section of your local video rental) are adults and they are STILL setting them off. Like the previous reviewer who wondered if the cast were anxious to get off the set and home I doubt more than one take was done for any of the scenes. Mira Sorvino hot in Mighty Aphrodite and other top-rated films seems to have undersold herself to this project. Her acting is non-existent confined mostly to wistful stares that are supposed to indicate how sensitive she is to the plight of the film's various victims. But let me warn you--do not be the next victim! Step away from the DVD if you find it on the shelf. Tbere are not many good leg shots of Mira (the only high points I could find in the film) and the supporting cast is of inferior quality delivering a mishmash of badly-done dialogue with embarrassing Spanish accents worthy of the best high school theatrical production. 
 Tainted look at kibbutz life This film is less a cultural story about a boy's life in a kibbutz but the deliberate demonization of kibbutz life in general. In the first two minutes of the movie the milk man in charge of the cows rapes one of his calves. And it's all downhill from there in terms of the characters representing typical kibbutznikim. Besides the two main characters a clinically depressed woman and her young son every one else in the kibbutz is a gross caricature of well?evil. The story centers on how the kibbutz like some sort of cult slowly drags the mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follows. There is no happiness no joy no laughter in this kibbutz. Every character/situation represents a different horrific human vice like misogyny hypocrisy violence cultism repression etc. For example while the protagonist is a strikingly handsome European looking 12 year old boy ? his older brother is a typical kibbutz youth complete with his jewish physical appearance and brutish personality. He cares more about screwing foreign volunteers than the health of his dying mother. He treats these volunteers like trash. After his little brother pleads of him to visit his dying mother whom he hasn't seen in a long time due to his military service he orders Quote ? Linda go take shower and I cum in two minutes. There is one other good character in this movie ? a European foreigner who plays the mother's boyfriend. When the animal rapist tries to hit the mother's son the boyfriend defends him by breaking the rapist's arm. He is summarily kicked out of the kibbutz then for violent behavior against one of the kibbutz members. More hypocrisy: The indescribably annoying French woman who plays the school teacher preaches that sex cannot happen before age 18 or without love and gives an account of the actual act that's supposed to be humorous for the audience but is really just stupid. She of course is screwing the head of the kibbutz in the fields who then in turn screws the little boy's mom when her mental health takes a turn for the worse. The film portrays the kibbutz like some sort of cult. Children get yanked out of their beds in the middle of the night and taken to some ritual where they swear allegiance in the fields overseen by the kibbutz elders. The mother apparently can't escape the kibbutz although in reality anyone was/is always free to come and go as they choose. It's a mystery how the boy's father died but you can rest assured the kibbutz drove him to it and his surviving parents are another pair of heartless wretched characters that weigh down on the mother and her son. That's the gist of this movie. One dimensional characters over dramatization dry performances and an insidious message that keeps trying to hammer itself into the audience's head ? that kibbutz life was degrading miserable and even deadly for those who didn't fit in. I feel sorry for the guy who made this film ? obviously he had a bad experience growing up in a kibbutz. But I feel as though he took a few kernels of truth regarding kibbutz life and turned them into huge atomic stereotyped bombs. 
 Faces are slashed throats are cut blood squirts and in end the three main characters are either depressed or they die. They even blow up Kevin Costner's dog with a shotgun. Why would anyone want to see a movie like this? Violence is valid only when the good guys kill the bad guys not the other way around. Take for instance Underworld and Underworld Evolution where you can enjoy seeing justice done when the demons are slain. In this movie the good guys are cut up. See the difference? Why would anyone want to MAKE a movie that depresses the audience? Beautiful photography and skilled editing in a motion picture like this is a waste of talent. Let's put this one into the category of the exquisite corpse. 
 This 30 minute documentary Bu?uel made in the early 1930's about one of Spain's poorest regions is in my opinion one of his weakest films. First let's admit that 70 years later Spain is much richer than it was then (and when I say this I fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own like excessive individualism and consumerism though all in all wealth it's a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here). And if poverty receded in Spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that Bu?uel favored but with Western European style capitalism. But one of the most shocking things about the movie is this: in one scene the narrator chides that in school children are taught the value of Pi. Teaching math to poor people the horror!. Bu?uel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation. What is he proposing? That children are taught exactly what at school? Doesn't Bu?uel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people? 
 Horror movie??really???? i cant believe how bad this movie was what the point of this movie??? the movie almost 1h and 30 min and the first 70 minutes of it is just lena walking around with this stupid look on her face after she had an accident....not much talking at all not even much actions at all.. i have to say tho the last 20 minuets it got little tiny action.. and was still stupid....... and the end oh my god i don't know where to begin it also end up with this stupid look on lena face lol.. don't get me wrong i love Lena Headey i think she is great actress but i don't know what got into her to do this movie.. don't waste your time and watching it because this movie has no story has no acting ..and has no point...not to mention how slow this movie goes and it feels like you been watching it forever. 
 I saw virtually no redeeming qualities in this movie. The only thing I did see was Quentin Tarantino's seeming insane obsession for it... There were some attractive women in this movie and perhaps that is one decent quality. Overall however I found this movie surrealistic and ridiculous. The hand held film making coupled with slow motion and other cinematic gimmicks I found clumsy and dizzying even sickening. Overall the music throughout was horrible and repetitive to the extreme as well reminding me of psychological warfare of the U.S. military against various malcontents. The various vignettes that made up the movie are haphazard in their placement and unfulfilling and unresolved in their content and conclusions. A depressing movie (not a true _film_ a term I reserve for true art) that left me with a bad feeling. Do not believe the various people that try and spin this as a romantic comedy though there are certainly isolated elements of both this movie repudiates in content form and conclusion any association with this genre. I suggest staying far away notwithstanding the seemingly overwhelming positive views of IMDb and other ratings sources. 
 This movie is a muddled mish-mash of clichs from recent cinema. There are some promising ideas in there but while the director was clearly aiming to wind up with a hauntingly ambiguous film what he ended up with was a confusing mess. Lead actor Daniel Wu does a fair job but with no central theme it seems as though he doesn't have much to work with. Furthermore the movie is largely devoid of scares (although in fairness there are some creepy moments amid the drudgery). *MILD SPOILERS* We have the mysterious death of an estranged twin diabolical librarians ghostly love interests identity confusion death by savage monkeys oedipal conflict abusive stepfathers sublimated homosexuality and crime gang connections. The only real commonality these elements share seems to be that they cause the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and discontent. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect to this film is that despite the brother's death by monkeys being strongly featured on the DVD cover the act itself is never directly portrayed. Instead director Julian Lee uses what appears to be stock footage of monkeys - not very scary. *END SPOILERS* Avoid this one. For an excellent psychological ambiguous horror tale check out the Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters (2003). 
 And I mean ultra light. This film features four giant stars about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond that. There really isn't too much to say about this stinker other than that although it has a couple of really good bits most of it isn't very funny. Nor does it work at all as a romance. How about as a romantic comedy? Not on your life. Most of the dialogue is way too flat to be sophisticated much less amusing. What's really ashame is the premise is not bad at all. This movie could have been so much more especially with all the recent focus on some of the bogus ways in which films are promoted complete with phony quotes from critics. The film uncovers the un-mined territory of the press junket -- those all expense paid trips for journalists who almost always write nice reviews. But instead of exploring what should have been a motherlode of jokes it devotes all of about three minutes to this territory and moves on in pursuit of the film's lame romance. The same with Catherine Zeta-Jones' character -- the whinny self centered movie star. Zeta-Jones does a good job with what she's given but she's given practically nothing. It's all homogenized junk that looks very pale in comparison with some of the things we've heard about stars over the years. In the end it is hard to understand what made Zeta-Jones Julia Roberts John Cusack and Billy Crystal sign aboard this doomed ship which sinks like a rerun of The Love Boat. In fact as the old joke goes they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal. It would probably make a better story. So go ahead and tell us filmmakers what do you have on these stars that got them to appear in this? 
 Because some people like me like to know EVERYTHING about a movie even if they plan to see it including the ending. Anyway here's the ending as I remember it because I couldn't have been more than 8 yrs old when I saw it for the first and only time on TV. But I'll tell ya it sure scared the little kid that I was and I thought about it for days afterward and it still stands out in my mind to this day even though some of the details are a little vague. Abe Vigoda was in this movie? I don't remember that! I didn't even remember that ol' Barnabus was in this movie and I LOVED Dark Shadows. So at the end the lead character (Belinda Montgomery?) is lured by the Judge (Joseph Cotton I'm guessing even though I remember it as him being an old family physician or something instead of a judge; see how memory fades?) to the wedding place which as I remember it is in a cavern of some kind? Maybe I've got that wrong; and Shelley Winters is there laughing and the Judge has a cape on and the camera angle is kind of looking up at him and he throws back the cloak and he has goat legs and he announces he's actually her father the Devil and she's played right into their (the satanic cult's) hands because the mortal guy she has fallen in love with (I guess that's Robert Foxworth) turns out also to be the guy Satan wants to marry her off to The Demon with Yellow Eyes and yep sure enough they show Robert Foxworth and his eyes glow yellow. There are a lot of close-ups in the last few minutes of the film. Everyone is laughing and rejoicing except for Belinda Montgomery who is very unhappy and cries or screams or something and that's the end. The bad guys win. 
 I'll try to use words to describe this on.... I saw the original which was good in its own way but back then I should have feared a sequel. And I was 'afraid' when I picked this one up but now that I've seen it I have to say it's even worse then I thought. Why these movies still get money still makes my mind spin. Let's start with the actors;they aren't all that good but it has to be said some make heads turn by being just plain awful. But what can an actor do with a script like this one. It's trying to be a copy of the original only this time the places have changed any form of story is gone and any attempt of actually coming up with something that hasn't been done before fails miserably. In a futile attempt to get it up-to-date they try to make it exciting by making use of the whole 'big-brother' theme but that has been worn out ages ago and offers nothing but a filler for between the beginning and the end. An attempt was made to try to save the movie by making a ton of references to the '83 original but it just ended up being plain funny and sometimes a bit sad. In conclusion if you have nothing and I mean nothing to do... go watch it or play Frisbee... with the DVD.... by yourself. It'll offer you the same amount of fun.. I promise 
 This is listed as a documentary it's not it's filmed sort of like a documentary but that I suspect was just because then they get away with a shaky camera and dodgy filming. This has just been released in the UK on DVD as an American Pie style comedy it's not that either. Basically it follows around a group of teens on spring break as they go to Mexico for cheap booze and with the quest being to get there virgin friend finally laid. Throw is a couple of dwarfs also on the same sort of quest and you have a non-hilarious tale of drunk teens trying to get some girls. Considering the 18 Rating this has very little nudity and practically zero sex scenes mainly I guess the rating is for swearing of which there is plenty. If you like crude Jackass behaviour without the humour then this may be your thing if you have any brain cells left then I would probably avoid this! 
 Movies have put me to sleep before but no movie has ever done that twice so it took me three sittings actually to finish it. The dialog was bad. Women spoke stiltedly and the men were caricatures. And two of the supposedly Japanese women looked Chinese had Chinese names and spoke with clearly Chinese accents. I'm still trying to figure out why the Emmenthal men were sexually wrapped up with each other. 10 minus 8 1/2 equals a tough choice: Do I give this movie a rating of one? or two?

 It is nice to see the likes of Oliver Stone Brian DePalma Al Pacino and even Michelle Pfiefer make one monumental piece of cinematic garbage. It is nice to see people so rich and 'successful' wasting their time on one of the most forgettable trite and pathetic pieces of film-making of all time. This movie represents the worst of Hollywood. What is this? Is it based on a true story. Well they do start with some basic news bites and facts that they read off USA today. But then the movie departs to some fantasy world and a 'cuban' refugee going to make it in the American drug subculture; kind of like Rocky on cocaine. Is it a movie about Cuba or Cubans? For the life of me I don't believe there is a single Cuban in this movie. The accents are totally fake and scene with Antonio's mother looks like a poster for midwest American values. The whole scene looks like something out of the Dick Van Dyke show. Is this movie about Miami? It looks more like L.A. transposed in Florida. Afterall a palm tree is a palm tree. Is this a romance novel. The relationship between Pacino and Pfeiffer is so obvious from the getgo and there is not one shred of possibility that these two characters could ever care for each other. Is this a drug movie? Well no issues of obsession or addiction are even mentioned. The behavior of the actors after a line of coke is nothing different than had they had a drink of water. Admittedly the acting is terrible. Let's get to the rest. The music is disgusting and sounds like latin elevator music or something out of a Lawrence Welk show. I think I heard a polka? The camera work is shoddy with too much movement and far more cranes than could ever be effective. Clearly the photography budget was excessive. The sound is bleached in a number of spots and the dialogue seems to be carried out in a warehouse. The writing is appalling. This is one of those movies were the script writes itself. You are dragged from one trite piece of dialogue to the next each pushing the plot like a sack of bricks. So I am going to ask Is this even a movie? It could be a drama series patched together for two and a half hours. But at least a drama series has some kind of focus. Maybe it is just a bunch of poorly acted scenes taped together. Whatever it is movie or not it is a piece of crap. 
 The 60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton Julia Stiles Jerry O'Connell Jeremy Sisto Jordana Brewster Leonard Roberts Bill Smitrovich Annie Corley Charles S. Dutton. NBC mini-series (later released to video/DVD as full length feature film) about the treacherous 1960s as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family. The film's first half is driven by the excellent performance of Dutton as Reverend Willie Taylor and evenly spreads the storyline between the families. However Dutton's character is killed halfway through and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull incoherent and downright awful 2nd half. RATING: 4 out of 10. Not rated (later rated PG-13 for video/DVD release). 
 What made the French Connection work so well was the relationship between Doyle (Hackman) and Russo (Scheider). In this catastrophe directed by Frankenheimer (who also brought us such gems as Raindeer Games and the Island of Dr. Moreau) the movie focuses on Doyle and his singular obsession of capturing Charnier (Rey). The fictitious idea that the NYPD would allow Doyle to travel to Marseilles to find Charnier with the help of the French local authorities is laugh out loud funny. Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't Charnier skip town with 65 pounds of pure smack!!! A street value of 32 million but yeah let's send Doyle to find this guy it was his pinch after all. Please!!! The story was weak. The acting was terrible (with the lone exception of Hackman who completely overplayed his part). The direction was all over the place. Even the cuts between scenes were terrible. Do yourself a favor and watch the first installment twice and skip this one. 
 What an appalling film. Don't get me wrong Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are good actors but aside from a few interesting set pieces the film is mostly taken up with hysterical submariners shouting crying sweating and generally freaking out when anything goes wrong. Take that with simplistic asides to make sure the audience still understand what's going on (the scene where Denzel Washington explains to a radio repairman how he must be like Scotty in Star Trek is nothing more than a joke) and you have a dumbed down thriller not worthy of the acting. Let us just hope that the real nuclear US Navy is not in the hands of such a script! 
 RUN...do not walk away from this movie!!!!! Aimed at the very young kids this movie will bore you to tears. If the Gamera trilogy of the 90's raised the bar this film just lowered it. It's slow paced and the monster fighting is good but seldom seen. This movie had me dry heaving in the cat box. Just a very poor offering after a phenomenal 90's series. SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT!!!!!!!!!!! Here are the top 10 reasons Gamera fans of the 90's series will HATE this film. 10. This movie is a drama that follows a kid trying to cope with the death of his mother and fears losing baby Gamera to a fight after knowing his father saw the adult Gamera die. 9. You see the adult Gamera for maybe a minute at the beginning of the film. He gets his butt kicked by a few Gyaos and self destructs??? He looks old and lethargic. Plus he looks nothing like any gamera you've ever seen. His suit looked cheap and rushed. 8. The young Gamera you see through the rest of the film looks like a Pokemon. Big-eyed and cute...it will remind you of the baby Godzilla from Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla 2. Gamera is now too cute. 7. This movie has the pace of watching a NASCAR race during a 3 hour rain delay. I watched this movie with 2 other Gamera fans and nobody was happy with how slowly this film moved along. I've seen an SUV full of fat people going up a mountain road move faster. 6. Like Godzilla:Final Wars this movie had very little kaiju time on screen. Final Wars had much more actually and better fights although short. 5. Kids take the title role. The friend of all children theme and poor writing killed the original Gamera series in the 1970's and history repeats itself in the 2000's. The most successful Gamera films abandoned the Sesame Street feel and went to a darker place. Why go back to a failed formula? This was to be a new trilogy and poor ticket sales killed any hope for this story to continue (thank god). 4. Gamera lost his iconic roar. He now sounds like an Elephant with strep throat. 3. This movie may produce a new Olympic event.....Imagine a relay race that involves sending very young children into harm's way. You have to see the ending to understand this point. Where were the parents? Oh yea..right there sending their kids into a kaiju battle zone. 2. The special effects were good but sub-par for a Gamera movie. Legion and Iris had better effects. The best effect was showing the apple sized baby Gamera fly. Not too impressive. 1. This movie is just not what adult kaiju fans come to expect. The director was involved in Power Rangers and it shows. It comes off like a cross between ET Always: Sunset on Third Street and TMNT. Kudos if you know all 3 references. Rental at best or watch once if you buy it to complete the DVD series. 
 This movie is being shown over and over on cable lately so.. There is no excuse for these 2 attractive women to fight over either Luke Wilson or the equally vapid 'villian' in this movie. The female actresses are very cute and that's the only reason to watch this movie. I suppose it is 'funny' that Luke's even uglier/dorkier/stupider friend is around but well that is what we get. Neither of the female leads would ever EVER talk to any of the males in this movie for more than 5 minutes. What we get is them sobbing and crying and fighting and so on over 2 guys that were best described in Friday the 13th 4. Dead *@$# 
 Spoiler!! I love Branagh love Helena Bonham-Carter loved them together in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein - but THIS - I can understand an actor's desire to stretch to avoid the romantic stereotype. Well they did but really - the script droned on Bonham-Carter's clothes were tres chic and the occasional speeded-up madcap sequence could have been an outtake from a Beatles' movie or the old Rowan and Martin Laugh-In. I never got the point - other commenters say the Branagh character was a dreamer. I never felt that. He was a loser and not very bright and certainly not endearing. The business with the bank robber disguise was merely painful to watch. Certainly not amusing. Bonham-Carter's realistic (one supposes) attempts as realistic speech were harder to understand than the first 15 minutes of Lancashire accent in Full Monty. The poetic ending with him high on a hill with her buried under the monstrosity of his airplane was too orchestrated. Was there a choir of angels or merely a soundtrack? Go back to the classics or something with a spine and an arc to it. Donate this to PBS. 
 This is quite possibly the worst Christmas film ever. The plot is virtually non-existent the acting (Affleck in particular) is poor at best. Ben Affleck fans will probably defend this film but deep down they must agree. As far as I could gather the plot consisted of Ben Affleck a millionaire salesman is told by a shrink to go to a place that reminds him of his childhood and burn a list of things he wanted to forget from his childhood. On doing this he ends up paying the family currently living in the house to be his family for Christmas... and that is it. The film goes on and eventually he gets together with the daughter of the family.... blah blah blah. 
 Wow here it finally is; the action movie without action. In a real low-budget setting (don't miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times) of a future Seattle we find a no-brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood. There is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors' performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies mainly Matrix without having the money to do it right. Yes we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot-outs (45 secs approx.) but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody's attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then. And yes we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere as if the script was thought-out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes. Believe me it is as bad as it possibly can get. In fact it doesn't deserve to be taken seriously but perhaps I can make some of you not rent it and save your money. 
 Have not watched kids films for some years so I missed Here Come the Tigers when it first came out. (Never even saw Bad News Bears even though in the '70s I worked for the guys who arranged financing for that movie Warriors Man Who Would Be King and Rocky Horror Picture Show among others.) Now I like to check out old or small movies and find people who have gone on to great careers despite being in a less than great movie early on. Just minutes into this movie I could take no more and jumped to the end credits to see if there was a young actor in this movie who had gone on to bigger and better things--at least watching for his/her appearance would create some interest as the plot and acting weren't doing the job. Lo and behold I spied Wes Craven's name in the credits as an electrical gaffer. He'd already made two or three of his early shockers but had not yet created Freddie Krueger or made the Scream movies. Maybe he owed a favor and helped out on this pic. More surprising was Fred J. Lincoln in the cast credits as Aesop a wacky character in the movie. F.J. Lincoln from the '70s to just a few years ago appeared in and produced adult films. He was associated with the adult spoof The Ozporns and just that title is funnier than all of Tigers attempts at humor combined. Let the fact that an adult actor was placed in a kids movie be an indication as to how the people making this movie must have been asleep at the wheel. 
 I've now seen this film twice and I must say I enjoyed it both times. It's fast paced and fun but ultimately daft. Having said that it deserves to be trashed because of screwing up what could have been a good follow up to the seminal original. It is clear for those who have seen the awful 'Zombie Creeping Flesh' that the films massive shortcomings can be owed to Bruno Mattei and that the little that is commendable about it can be owed to Fulci. This is not idle Fulci sycophancy the directors styles are starkly contrasted throughout and you can tell who directed what particularly in Mattei's case. The film is centered around the outbreak of a virus (oddly referred to as 'top secret' by a scientist it's secrecy apparently being more noteworthy than its potentially apocalyptic effect on mankind) somewhere in south east Asia. The virus causes zombie like behaviour in those affected and the virus quickly spreads across a seemingly arbitrary area of land. Our protagonists unwittingly wander into the danger zone and have to fight for their lives against hordes of infected Asians. The film seems to be stuck half way between being a zombie gore flick and an out and out action adventure and this confusion is captured most clearly by the zombies themselves. They do not appear to have a set of characteristics common to all. Some are of the regular soulless shuffling variety so well rendered in the original and probably Fulci's creation here. The other main group consist of those who in being infected with the virus lost all sense of themselves but incurred a savage aggression and a desire to earn a black belt in ninjitsu: Indecisively leaping around unsure of whether to continue honing their upper roundhouse technique or engage with their brethren in what looks like a mass tickle fest on their hapless victims. Martial arts skills aren't their only talents either they are well versed in guerilla tactics hiding on rafters and under bales of hay and sometimes inexplicably falling from nowhere but the heavens themselves. This is all definitely the work of Mattei. There is a third more chatty variety of zombie. This type apparently retain a sense of irony as well 'I'm really thirsty...FOR YOUR BLOOD'. The ridiculous twist at the end in which the DJ turns zombie but continues to preach ad libbed gibberish about the fate of mankind only serves to enhance the WTF factor and obliterate any hope of a serious resolution. Then there's the infamous zombie head which slowly propels itself through the air a jokerish skeletal grin wrought across its face as if to say 'yeah we know how bad this looks'. The characters are all utterly one dimensional as you would expect. But its the pseudo comical dialogue and dubbing that really prevents us from taking their plight seriously. Having said that the first soldier to die does put up an impressively valiant display against an unstoppable zombie menace. Indeed this is the first and perhaps only time we hit real zombie agro and one of the only effective scenes in the film. The guy who played the chief scientist has heart but no talent utilising pauses in his lines entirely at random so he ends up sounding like a confused asthmatic. The scientists' on screen attempts at finding an antidote are totally unconvincing 'now lets put these two molecules together!' There are a few moments that stick out as genuinely effective however. In an early scene a female protagonist explores an abandoned garage. Upon entering a room we are confronted with a hazy view of a shifting figure in the corner and a squirming mass on the floor all shot in an atmospheric diffused light. The silence is interrupted by the appearance of a speedy machete wielding zombie who trashes everything in his wake in his alarming desperation to have her. His sheer aggressiveness is one of the few moments of real horror in the film. The before and after theme conveyed through the hotel that plays host to the happenings of the earliest stage of the outbreak and later as a refuge to our protagonists is imbued with an thick humid ambiance. There is a scene in which one of the soldiers cautiously approaches a boarded up room that clearly houses hordes of the undead and this is quite tense. Things become more dramatic when they board themselves in the hotel unknowing to what lurks upstairs. But this is sloppily handled and not nearly as effective as it could have been. All in all I would say this film may just about deserve to be called a royal screw up of a potentially effective tropical zombie fest rather than simply a through and through bad film. If nothing else it has plenty of the unintentional laughs that I've come to expect from just about anything Italian and gory from the eighties. 
 Surely no Saturday morning TV kids' show was ever done this poorly. After all those producers had to count on the audience coming back. Well in this awful offering they could at least count the money they saved on sets. The script could have been a reject from some long-forgotten space opera serial with a few smarmy lines added for cool-dude Gerald Mohr to murmur to Naura Hayden. No director could have done anything decent with such a loony storyline so the action just plods boringly along. The spaceship props are absurd--a Bulova wall clock and portable typewriter for example--but the planet sets have got to be some of the worst in cinematic history. Most are crude drawings and it's all bathed in an often misfocused red light. Even Mohr's bare hairy chest is used as a prop. And it's a bad one--as rib-thin as the plot. Any viewer who can make it to the end of this movie will hear a message from the Martians--and will probably agree completely! 
 Home Alone 3 is one of my least favourite movies. It's the cream of the crop or s*** if you tend to be more cynical as it ranks up (or down) there with stuff like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones: Viva Rock Vegas. In fact it could even be worse than those two since those two at least intermittently made me laugh at their stupidity. This just made me cringe in pain constantly and clap when the credits started rolling. No other movie has made me cringe in pain. Now I will point out exactly why this movie is so incredibly atrocious. First off the plot is ridiculous. It revolves around a chip in a remote control car (?!) that is misplaced and how these terrorists want it. Dumb stuff. The action that ensues is similar to that of the other two Home Alones with boobytraps and all but watching these boobytraps being executed is rather than being funny incredibly unpleasant to watch. I didn't laugh (or even so much as smile) once rather I cringed constantly and hoped that the terrorists would nail the kid. The bird rather than providing comic relief was unfunny and annoying. The acting as done by a bunch of no names ranges from poor to atrocious. There is not a single good performance here. Alex D.Linz is absolutely unlikeable and unfunny as the kid while the terrorists act (and judging by their movie credits look) as they've been hastily picked off the street...and well that's it. I can see some people saying: Man it's for the kids. Don't dis it man. Well MAN kids may like this but they can get a hell of a lot better. See Monsters Inc. and Toy Story before even considering getting this out. Hell even Scooby Doo and Garfield (which suck - see those reviews for more) are better than this! So in short this is an irredeemably atrocious movie. This was clearly recycled for the money as it almost completely rips off the first two; the only thing is it completely insults the first two as well. No human kid or otherwise should find any reason to see Home Alone 3. Ever. It's THAT bad. 0/5 stars 
 To grasp where this 1976 version of A STAR IS BORN is coming from consider this: Its final number is sung by Barbra Streisand in a seven minute and forty second close-up followed by another two-and-half-minute freeze frame of Ms. Streisand -- striking a Christ-like pose -- behind the closing credits. Over ten uninterrupted minutes of Barbra's distinctive visage dead center filling the big screen with uncompromising ego. That just might be some sort of cinematic record. Or think about this: The plot of this musical revolves around a love affair between two musical superstars yet while Streisand's songs are performed in their entirety -- including the interminable finale -- her costar Kris Kristofferson isn't allowed to complete even one single song he performs. Nor though she does allow him to contribute a little back up to a couple of her ditties do they actually sing a duet. Or consider this: Streisand's name appears in the credits at least six times including taking credit for musical concepts and her wardrobe (from her closet) -- and she also allegedly wanted but failed to get co-directing credit as well. One of her credits was as executive producer with a producer credit going to her then-boyfriend and former hairdresser Jon Peters. As such Streisand controlled the final cut of the film which explains why it is so obsessed with skewing the film in her direction. What it doesn't explain is how come given every opportunity to make The Great Diva look good their efforts only make Streisand look bad. Even though this was one of Streisand's greatest box office hits it is arguably her worst film and contains her worst performance. Anyway moving the melodrama from Hollywood to the world of sex-drugs-and-rock'n'roll Streisand plays Esther Hoffman a pop singer on the road to stardom who shares the fast lane for a while with Kristofferson's John Norman Howard a hard rocker heading for the off ramp to Has-beenville. In the previous incarnations of the story Norman Maine sacrifices his leading man career to help newcomer Vicky Lester achieve her success. In the feminist seventies Streisand & Co. want to make it clear that their heroine owes nothing to a man so the trajectory is skewed; she'll succeed with or without him and he is pretty much near bottom from scene one; he's a burden she must endure in the name of love. As such there is an obvious effort to make the leading lady not just tougher but almost ruthless while her paramour comes off as a henpecked twit. Kristofferson schleps through the film with a credible indifference to the material; making little attempt to give much of a performance and oddly it serves his aimless listless character well. Streisand on the other hand exhibits not one moment of honesty in her entire time on screen. Everything she does seems if not too rehearsed at least too controlled. Even her apparent ad libs seem awkwardly premeditated and her moments of supposed hysteria coldly mechanical. The two have no chemistry making the central love affair totally unbelievable. You might presume that his character sees in her a symbol of his fading youth and innocence though at age 34 Streisand doesn't seem particularly young or naive. The only conceivable attraction he might offer to her is that she can exploit him as a faster route to stardom. And indeed had the film had the guts to actually play the material that way to make Streisand's character openly play an exploitive villain the film might have had a spark and maybe a reason to exist. But I guess the filmmakers actually see Esther as a sympathetic victim; they don't seem to be aware just how cold-blooded and self absorbed she is. But sensitivity is not one of the film's strong points: note the petty joke of giving Barbra two African American back up singers just so the film can indulge in the lame racism of calling the trio The Oreos. And the film makes a big deal of pointing out that Esther retains her ethnic identity by using her given name of Hoffman yet the filmmakers have changed the character's name of the previous films from Esther Blodgett so that Streisand won't be burdened with a name that is too Jewish or too unattractive. So much for ethnic pride. The backstage back stabbing and backbiting that proceeded the film's release is near legendary so the fact that the film ended up looking so polished is remarkable. Nominal director Frank Pierson seems to have delivered the raw material for a good movie with considerable help from ace cinematographer Robert Surtees. And the film did serve its purpose producing a soundtrack album of decent pop tunes (including the Oscar-winning Evergreen by Paul Williams and Streisand). But overall the film turned out to be the one thing Streisand reportedly claimed she didn't want it to be a vanity project. 
 ...which isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Overall DinoCroc was a much better movie. Sure in that movie Matt Borlenghi played a complete wuss-bag who spent the entire movie crying about his little brother getting eaten by the DinoCroc. But the special effects in DinoCroc were better the plot lines were better and the acting was better. Here are the problems with Blood Surf -- 1) the killer crocodile looks like a kid's model with a retractable jaw. 2) the plot is ridiculous. Matt Borlenghi & Co. get shipwrecked on a deserted island in which they encounter a rabid group of ugly Filipino natives who try to force themselves upon the women in the group. Which was a complete waste of 15 minutes of film. And 3) there's not enough croc time. There are a couple of redeeming qualities of Blood Surf -- the actresses are pretty attractive and Matt Borlenghi gets eaten by the croc towards the end of the movie. But if you're on your deathbed and only have enough time to watch one Matt Borlenghi/killer crocodile movie skip this one and fire up DinoCroc instead. 
 It's not so much that SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION had little potential. Indeed the under-explored title phenomenon is quite intriguing and for at least the opening half this Tobe Hooper effort promises to entertain in a way only cheesy '90s horror can. But somewhere between Brad Dourif's on-again-off-again performance and the overly intricate plot this would-be thriller loses its way. Dourif featured here before his built-in horror fan base had accumulated is average guy Sam. Of course average guys don't stay average for long in horror movies so after a well-done origin outline we see Sam's various body parts start to ignite. Soon he's igniting other people too much to the consternation of gal pal Lisa played unmemorably by Cynthia Bain. While the title of the film implies a fire-happy monster on the loose director Hooper opted to make Sam an unwilling killer. This approach gives the film an added human depth it would otherwise lack but it also prevents us from truly fearing the human flamethrower. We're left wondering whether this would have worked better as a straight-up villain-versus-everyone effort ala NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION is a pretty nominal effort when all is said and done. It will carry added appeal for Dourif's fans and those who can't get enough 1990s horror be it good bad or in between but only on a slow night. 
 Yes the first Howling was a classic. A rather good werewolf movie that I admit started slowly but gained momentum along the way to have a rather good finish then the anchorwoman changed into a cute werewolf only to be gunned down on camera. Yes that made for an entertaining horror movie to be sure...well forget all of that as this movie has nothing to do with that film. Oh sure they kind of make it out that the anchor woman is the same and that her brother or something is wanting to find out what and why things went down as they did but they go from the little cozy retreat from the first movie to Transylvania or somewhere here where they must battle evil magician werewolves or something. I often wonder what in the world Christopher Lee was doing in this movie however I read the trivia here where it says he had never been in a werewolf movie before but still read the script before you take a role. Maybe you could have gotten into An American Werewolf in London hell that could have been possible. It was set in London after all. Heck werewolves do not seem to figure much into this movie except for a rather bizarre and prolonged sex scene. In fact the most memorable death in this movie for me was when the one gal started talking loudly and this one dude's ear's started bleeding. 
 What are people on here talking about? I must have seen a different movie than you guys. I was so bored that I walked out of the theater. What is up with this stuff. I only laughed once and not even that hard. Whoever greenlit this movie should be taken out into the street and beaten. I usually always find something I like in a movie but this is crazy. Slackers makes Not Another Teen Movie look like a classic. It ranks up there with such trash as Body Shots Con Air and Conspiracy Theory as one of the worst of all time. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! I thought the studio would be handing out money to people as they left the theater as a sign of their apologies but to my dismay that wasn't happening. Looks like I will never see that money again or the two hours. 
 Absolutely fantastic. Now before a legion of cinema purists choke on their latts allow me to elaborate. Much as I enjoyed it this is quite simply one of the worst films I have ever seen and is certainly the worst film I've seen at the cinema (an impressive claim as I remember seeing Daredevil on the big screen). The two leads (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) were unconvincing at best and downright awful at worst. Of course they weren't helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a Daphne & Celeste single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the OJ defence. The plot (to stretch the term slightly) was thin to non-existent and the 'gore' scenes whilst undoubtedly brutal were irrelevant and laughably formulaic. What plot there is revolves around a twenty-something model (Cuthbert) who is abducted imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures both psychological and physical. The torture scenes feel like disconnected set pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking rather than scaring the audience. Whilst there really are very very few positives to draw from this film its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a dreadful film. I have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema. Within twenty minutes the entire cinema was in stitches and remained that way throughout. For my part I came out flushed with laughter buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of appalling film-making. Whichever way you look at it this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how not to make a film. P.S. I omitted to mention that I managed to get in to the film free...so I can afford to laugh about it. I was still tempted to ask for my money back...it really was THAT bad. 
 METAMORPHOSIS I am working my way through the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and METAMORPHOSIS is the seventh movie in the set. Released in 1990 METAMORPHOSIS seems to be a remake of The Atom Age Vampire which also featured a scientist striving for similar results. Set in modern times METAMORPHSIS is not my kind of horror movie. A university researcher is working to crack the human genome in order to create a serum that would prevent aging. Pressured by the administration to publish his papers; and produce some results (or risk losing funding) the scientist decides to use himself as a guinea pig! At first thinking that he suffered no adverse side effects he eventually discovers that the serum has indeed altered him in the most unexpected manner! The acting is stilted; and the performances left me with a much diminished interest in the film. The score is pandering. And the science behind the experiments and their findings is not only fallacious; it's absurd; it's ridiculous ? at best. As others noted the end turns into a 30+ minute gag which is seemingly endless. Without giving too much away I'd call this one Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde meet the Creature From the Black Lagoon meets Home Alone.  
 Oh man it is amazing how somebody can claim global warming to be a science well I guess this elitist nonsense is now replacing the science of eugenics! Al Gore tries to make this issue sound complicated even though it just needs common sense to see this whole thing is a big hoax by a man with his own moneymaking agenda! How have scientists estimated historical temperatures of this planet? By estimating the sun spot activity. Has nobody ever questioned if this method has been accurate? No not even Gore himself! So how the heck would it not be accurate to forecast future temperature with sun spot activity if it has been that accurate in the past? According to sun spot activity the temperature today is totally in line with what it should be. How come the temperature in the entire universe has risen (relatively) equal much as on earth? Does our SUVs cause temperature on Jupiter to rise? Use some common sense! You do not need to be a rocket scientist to figure out that this can be nothing else than a HOAX. Please research it yourself. What does Al Gore and his elitist friends like Rothschild (banking family that arranged live earth event) to gain from this? Well the new world bank will be founded on carbon credits that is tax on everything that gives CO2 omissions and it is easier to get away with these taxes if the people are lured to think it is to save the world when it is only about money centralized control and more power to the elitist bankers. Al Gore has even a company that sells carbon credits! Is it not noble to pay voluntarily carbon credits to save the world especially if it goes into his own company? I do not want you to blindly believe me please do your own research and use your own common sense and I am sure you will come to the right conclusion! 
 yeah cheap shot i know but this movie is a great example of how a collection of signifiers of 'deepness' (political turmoil love/lust) can be combined haphazardly to great critical acclaim (see also 'american beauty'). kaufman's movie plods along with gratuitous sex scenes interspersed with often painful dialog sequences (in one scene i counted three different 'generic European' accents affected by the actors) and displays of state might run amok yet fails to tie them together into the coherent meditation kundera offered. and in its over-long three hours it manages almost completely to gloss over franz the missing fourth piece in the love triangle that lies at the heart of the plot and in this manner sacrifices the novel's central mechanism of displaying the spectrum of emotions and of power relations that obtain in love affairs. it also fails to even include token screen time for tomas' son used in the novel to exemplify some of the political points kundera was making in the novel. combined with the overweening soundtrack these flaws make this movie's three hours unbearably weighty in tone yet light in content. 
 This movie wasn't awful but it wasn't very good. I am a big fan Toni Collette I think she is a very beautiful and talented actress. The movie starts off about Robin Williams who is a writer and gets a book from a 14 year old kid. The book is great and he cant't believe a kid wrote it. Toni Collette plays the kids guardian who you don't know if this kid really exists or if she's making it all up. I am not gonna ruin the movie but I will say this the movie is not scary. The acting is pretty good and Toni Collette's performance was awesome as well as Robin Williams. The movie was a huge disappointment in my opinion I would wait for it to come to DVD. 
 A one is the highest rating I could have given this movie considering zero and negative numbers are not allowed. Pee yew pointless mess of a movie with a lot of wasted b-list actors who have done better work written and directed by some guy with the mentality of a twelve year old who smirks and giggles at stupid puns and poop and fart jokes. For example Gene Stapelton's (Ding-Bat from All in the Family) character telling Marilu Henner's character that she swings both ways sexually was a cheap attempt at humor indicative of the general lameness of the movie... You want good cheeky humor? Rent Animal House American Pie (part one only) Old School or Office Space. 
 this movie was just plain dumb i do not think it was scary at all i went in hoping to be shocked and scared but was mostly laughing some of the scenes were just to fake and thrown together blood scenes were extremely over cg and some of the mutants were ridiculously gay looking it also sucked because the acting was just plain horrible u think they could get some good actors and most of the characters i hated just because how stupid and lame they acted even though they were supposed to be in the military i get to watch movies for free and seen many people walking out im guessing because it was so dumb kinda glad i didn't have to pay for it in short DUMB ASS MOVIE don't see it...but then again thats my opinion 
 Shinobi is one of those movies that thinks the mere act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense of gravitas or emotion to the story. Unfortunately for the audience to actually care about the people dying you have to develop the characters otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence. The problem is especially compounded when you have TONS of characters all of whom die. OK so if you can't be bothered to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way you can at least make the REASONS for why they die plausible right? Nope. Here we have a war between two ninja clans with neither side really knowing WHY they are fighting each other. They kill each other because the emperor says so. Yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants ALL of them dead they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions. That's not stubbornness... that's just plain dumb. Fine fine! There is no character development and the plot provides no reasonable rationale for fighting. At least they die fighting in cool action scenes right? Yet again NO! In fact many of the fights aren't even fights at all: super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly (and lamely in my opinion). I'm talking about things like Lalala I'm walking along and I- *neck gets slashed*. THE END for that character. Not even halfway through the film I threw my hands up in frustration at the ludicrousness of it. 
 A surprising misfire from the usually reliable Larry Cohen (God Told Me Too Q etc.) Full Moon High tries so hard to be funny and fails miserably even with decent turns by Ed McMahon(!) and Kenneth Mars. Alan Arkin looks embarrassed throughout his performance and son Adam simply looks numb. This makes Teen Wolf look like a comedy classic. 
 I am very unpolitically correct guy so when I say sexist I really mean it reduced the female guest lead Dr Miranda Jones played by Diana Muldar. in spite of all her supposed brilliance and self control to nothing more inside but a big jealous unreasonable baby You prolly got the plot by now after her technical sidekick Marvik also a spurned lover flips out when he tried to kill the Medusan Ambassador Kollos out of a jealous rage but glimpsed first it instead. (You think he could have just walked in to the room with his eyes shut and phasered the box too easy) he takes the Enterprise into un-navigable space outside the galaxy before the boys could subdue him. Well the ship is stuck in limbo at that point they could have gone to the good lady doctor-liaison and discussed it. Spock has to make a mind meld with the Medusan so we can get home. I mean like beetch do you want to stay adrift until we run out of supplies and die? But the lady in true Star Trek fashion is a jealous monsters who whines and wails when the idea is broached even when her Medusan idol told her to shut up & go along with them. So the beetch out of spite messes with the melded Spock causing him to forget to put on his visor which makes Spock go insane. Kirk naturally figured out what a total twit she was and shamed her into fixing Spock up with her superior telepathic powers. Of course at the end the Lady and Medusan leave and all is forgiven. You almost wish the President from Battle Star Galactica showed up to jettison the witch out of an airlock for her destructive stunt. But in Star Trek land ladies are permitted to be totally unreasonable and cruel yet at the same time supposedly there is sexual equality. This is what I mean by sexist. 
 I mean really. This is not going to help the Australian film industry to make this kind of film with no values of any kind. Okay if you're a stoner and have nothing better to do then maybe. I think film-makers from here should try to show the rest of the world what great talented people we have and this is not the vehicle for it. Come on now this film is just tacky. 
 Curiosity led me to this masterpiece . Unfortunately I didn't rent it I bought it! The most disturbing thing about this film is that it's not so disturbing. For reasons known only to them the makers of this film set out to show the human side of Jeffry Dahmer. Are you kidding me? The man gave new meaning to the term finger lickin' good ! And with all the flash-backs and flash-forwards I had trouble following the story. All in all Jeremy Renner's performance wasn't too bad. You can catch him in S.W.A.T. in which he plays a disgruntled ex-cop. Anyway I would rate this as a 1/10. It only got a 1 because of Renner's so-so performance. There are plenty of books and tv documentaries out there that do a much better job of covering Dahmer's crimes. Avoid this one. 
 This movie is so bad it can only be compared to the all-time worst comedy : Police Academy 7. No laughs throughout the movie. Do something worthwhile anything really. Just don't waste your time on this garbage. 
 It's a real challenge to make a movie about a baby being devoured by wild canines and the mother being wrongly accused of murder funny but against all odds this one succeeds. Meryl Streep gives the performance of her life melodramatic overwrought but with that comic genius that keeps you laughing even as a mother struggles with the ultimate horror. If comedies about the infants being eaten by dogs are not your cup of tea you might be uncomfortable watching this and yes it is an odd choice of topic for a farce but really very little of the movie has anything to do with that as it focuses on giving Streep a showcase for her Aussie accent and facial contortions. Throwing in a slam at media bias and sensationalism and disregard for either the truth or ethics gives the movie the chance to make the daring point that those things are bad. 
 I think that can sum up this show about as well as anything. Batman TAS may be the worst thing to ever happen to cartoons based on comic books because everything that comes after will be compared to it and nothing has measured up yet. It's just too damn good. Was Batman Beyond good? Yeah but it was no TAS. Is Justice League good? It's not too bad but it's no TAS. The Batman is certainly no TAS either but I won't hold that against it. It would be unfair and besides it has plenty of other problems with it. The concept of a younger less experienced Batman fighting crime is a fine one and at times the art is very nice. But all of the rest of the time the art is worthless Americanime and this betrays a lot of the flaws of the show itself. It is paced written and designed like an Americanime. If I wanted to watch Jackie Chan Adventures I'd watch Jackie Chan Adventures. Or I could just bang my head into a wall any time and get the same effect. The Joker is a homicidal mentally unstable clown in a suit who uses his wits unpredictability and clever gadgets to fight Batman. When he is forced to fight hand to hand he will either resort to something cheap or be totally outmatched. He is not meant to be a monkey with dreadlocks who knows kung-fu and can leap into twenty feet into the air accompanied by speed lines. If they had wanted to do that with a villain there were other less important characters they could have used or *gasp* they could have created a new one entirely. And it's not that re-imaginings are a bad thing don't get me wrong. TAS (there I go again) took Mr. Freeze from your standard icegun-wielding B villain and made him into a memorable and morally complex character. Of course Freeze wasn't exactly a classic villain at the time and they performed an upgrade but the point stands. What The Batman does is it takes everything you liked about Batman comics and lore and takes a large smelly dump on them. Guess what? They were eating corn. It's obvious this show can't stand against TAS but stand it on its own legs and it still doesn't work for me. The plots aren't good and they don't develop any better. They've been written for the demographic of children under twelve. Should children be able to enjoy a show? Of course they should. This shouldn't be an adult show with swearing nudity and gratuitous violence. But the mark of a truly good show is that it can be enjoyed on different levels by all ages. This show misses that mark. Is this show a TAS? No of course not. The problem is it's not even a JLU. 
 This movie is a blatant attempt by the left in Hollywood to portray Reagan's administration as incompetent and bungling. Some mistakes may have been made at the time of the crisis but I'm sure not to the extent portrayed in this lame movie. My first reaction was that this movie had to have been directed by Oliver Stone but I was wrong this time. There are apparently many others. 
 I just finished a marathon of this series and it became agonising to watch as it progressed. From the fictionalising of the historical elements to O'Herlihy's awful accent in later episodes the show just slumps the further it goes. If you are looking for some low quality production generalised WW2 fluff then I could recommend season 1 but avoid anything after that it degenerates into being one step from a soap opera with increasingly worse story lines and sensibility. The old B&W film is by far the best of any form of entertainment with the Colditz name attached to it and even that is not what one could hope for. 
 Just PPV'd this. I don't want to waste too much time on this as most of the posters here put it better than I ever could but I did want to say a few things. I didn't know which was funnier: Redgrave chasing tiny moths and tripping over her nurse; Close wailing that her precious boy (whom she and the Mr. had decided was a drunken loser) has been turned into roadkill; that the tone-deaf Ann schmoozed with Peggy Lee; or the horrid CGI of Crypt Keeper Annie gazing at her younger self! I never bought Danes as the younger Redgrave. I didn't buy Richardson and Collette as sisters either. If Meryl Streep's daughter wants to be an actress she better get Mama to give her a few lessons! I had zero idea why any girl (or Buddy) would make fools of themselves over vapid stud du jour Harris! Ann's daughters are as whiny and thoughtless as she Luc is a retarded slacker on crack and I didn't give a rot about any of them! Evening gives Chick Flicks a bad name! 
 I have only had the luxury of seeing this movie once when I was rather young so much of the movie is blurred in trying to remember it. However I can say it was not as funny as a movie called killer tomatoes should have been and the most memorable things from this movie are the song and the scene with the elderly couple talking about poor Timmy. Other than that the movie is really just scenes of little tomatoes and big tomatoes rolling around and people acting scared and overacting as people should do in a movie of this type. However just having a very silly premise and a catchy theme song do not a good comedy make. Granted this movie is supposed to be a B movie nothing to be taken seriously however you should still make jokes that are funny and not try to extend a mildly amusing premise into a full fledged movie. Perhaps a short would have been fine as the trailer showing the elderly couple mentioned above and a man desperately trying to gun down a larger tomato was actually pretty good. The trailer itself looked like a mock trailer but no they indeed made a full movie and a rather weak one at that. 
 After Disney's witty live-action George of the Jungle I had high hopes for this flick. Major disappointment. Thread bare plot bad acting bad visual effects. This film relied on lame one-liners idiotic ( and pointless) product placement and the lamest most annoying side-kick in that gadget car thing. I took two young kids to see it and they where bored out of their mind. The only laugh received from this movie was bad standby of when needing a laugh show a guy getting it in the groin! 
 Christ oh Christ... One watches stunned incredulous and possibly deranged as this tawdry exercise in mirthless smut unfolds with all the wit and dexterity of a palsied Galapagos tortoise. Can such things be? Does this movie actually exist or was I the unwitting guinea pig of some shadowy international drugs company sipping my coffee unaware that it had been spiked with a dangerous hallucinogen? I've seen a lot of films and a lot of bad films but nothing prepared me for this; by the end of it I was a gibbering snivelling wreck tearing at the carpet with my teeth like a dog clawing at the walls howling till my lungs were sore. I pleaded desperately frenziedly for mercy (to whom this appeal was made I don't know) and longed with burning desire for the soothing balm of Ozu Yasujiro. Sweet Weeping Jesus the memories... sometimes they come back to me. When I'm at my most vulnerable when I'm least able to handle them. I shudder I break down in tears I bite my fingernails till my hands are slathered with blood but I can't quite banish the awful flashbacks from my mind. I'm haunted. I'm damaged. I'm a shell of a man. The other user comments here suggest that I am not alone in having undergone this terrifying experience which can only mean one of two things: a) the film does in fact exist or b) I am but one victim among legions of an international conspiracy of truly sinister proportions. What is quite mind-boggling is that some people seem to have enjoyed their ordeal or at least have not been left traumatised by it. Perhaps they're part of the operation. God damn them the maniacs! God damn them all to Hell!!!!!! 
 Awful! Absolutely awful! No plot no point no end. It looks like the director turned the camera on and then the whole crew went to lunch. Every day. I'm trying to GIVE this video away but no one will take it. I'm giving it a 2 instead of a 1 because I like Benigni. Roger I'm going to have to say thumbs down on this one. 
 After Central City loses its mob boss to murder partner-in-crime Robert Armstrong (as Doc Rogers) decides to take drastic measures To preserve criminal continuity he recruits the dead mobster's milquetoast son Richard Cromwell (as Edward Baby Face Morgan) to run the family business.

While Cromwell sells innocently sells insurance his employees run an extortion racket. Cromwell falls for pretty client Mary Carlisle (as Virginia Clark); and the duo find themselves in great danger? Baby Face Morgan catches star Cromwell and Ms. Carlisle nearing the end of their once promising film careers. It's a quick light and inoffensive little crime drama. **** Baby Face Morgan (1942) Arthur Dreifuss ~ Richard Cromwell Mary Carlisle Robert Armstrong 
 Uh oh! Another gay film. This time it's showing the black side. Bet your last dollar it's gonna have an unhappy ending! But WHY? With only less than a half dozen exceptions ALL gay films have to end in death or an addio finale. It's like all the European Film Noir releases in the 40's 50's 60's and 70's. The lead...male or female must die or ride off alone into oblivion. Why in God's name must writers directors and producers have the audience leave the theatre feeling depressed? After all it's supposed to be gay...not glum. Maybe the category should be changed to a 'glum' film. A large percentage of gay relationships DO last and the couples DO ride off together into the sunset! No matter who writes or produces he only shows the down side of gay life and gives the incorrect impression of gay lifestyle. This movie just proves my point. If you rent the DVD take an antidepressant for here comes another 'gay' film! This is WRONG! 
 ...when he remade Broadway BILL (1934) as RIDING HIGH (1950). Recasting Bing Crosby as DAN BROOKS did not help a screenplay that was 'dated' in 34 let alone 50. This sad film has entire scenes lifted from the original with many of the supporting cast repeating their roles unless they were dead. Though being older did not seem to matter to the Director. Nor that the Cars and Clothes in the background plates from 1934 did not seem match up too 1950s' standards. Not even 'der Bingel' singing can redeem this effort. We rated both the original and the remake IMDb Four****Stars. Frank's touch was long gone and all that was left was CAPRA-CORN. That did not stop Mr. Capra though. After floundering around the 50's making some educational documentaries he wound up his career remaking LADY FOR A DAY (1933) as POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES (1961). Again a fine cast was let down on that IMDb Six******Star effort compared too the originals Eight********Stars. Sometimes it is better to quit while you were still ahead right after STATE OF THE UNION (1948). 
 I agree strongly with some of the other critics of this film. I found it incredibly silly (at best) and downright misleading misinforming and harmful (at worst). Like others I found this film to be an awful mix of real science and pseudoscientific New Age propaganda. As a psychologist I was especially offended by Candace Pert's contributions. True I was not a fan of hers before this film but her discourse on the consciousness of cells was one of the best examples of taking a term ( consciousness ) that has a predictable meaning to most people and using it in such a distorted manner as to cause it to obscure rather than clarify. It is an old Orwellian mind-f**k that the master himself described so well in his superb essay Politics and the English Language. To refer to consciousness in this manner--indeed to refer to this film as based in science in general (which is its clear intent)--is to use language in the same manner employed by Stalin when he labeled his slave-states democratic republics and Hitler when he called his party a socialist workers movement. I don't claim to really understand quantum physics. I know enough about it to know that to really understand it would take considerable study. Ah but we Americans do love instant enlightenment and that's what this mistake of a film tries to accomplish. If it ASKED questions that would be one thing but it clearly attempts to ask and ANSWER them which no film could possibly do simply because we are far far away from the answers (if they indeed exist). By the way ethically this film needed a disclaimer about the association of several expert commentators with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (and TM) not to mention J.Z. Knight who often speaks in her Ramtha voice. (I'm always amazed at this channeled 10 000 year-old Atlantean superman's grasp of 21st century concepts and terminology. But then again this film argues that the past present and future are all one and the same so if Ramtha existed in Atlantis 10 000 years ago I suppose he could exist now and tomorrow. Only then how come his financial advice has been so incredibly bad for his followers? Oh I forgot I'm the creator of good and bad advice so it's all my fault not Ramtha's.) What a mess. 
 I guess there are some out there that remember Nicole Eggert from her little girl days on such TV shows as T.J. Hooker Charles in Charge and Who's the Boss? You perverts you! Maybe you remember her from Baywatch when she grew up and got breast implants. No matter you will certainly forget her in this supposed comedy about man-eating aliens. There are so many things that do not make sense and are never explained. How did she recognize the alien? Why was the alien hot for paprika and cinnamon? Why didn't the alien eat her? You get the picture. Before the alien eats her boyfriend and assumes his identity you get to see her in the body of Alex Meneses. This Mexican/Ukranian beauty is the only reason to watch this trash. Stay for the shower scene and the boyfriend and go on about your business. 
 Watching this was like getting a large mackerel slapped in your face over and over again. Even when you thought That mackerel surely can't be coming around again *slap* there it was. I'm not sure what they were thinking. This is the sort of pilot I watched and wondered Did the actors know they were on a doomed ship destined to never be made into a series? Not only black stereotypes but Swedish and Indian ones as well. And while Blazing Saddles made these stereotypes into a mix of comedy and uncomfortableness these stereotypes were just downright offensive. There was no plot line the ending was slapped on and the jokes aren't. Still if you are a student of comedy watch this pilot to see what you shouldn't do. 
 now don't get me wrong i do enjoy christmas movies. i love its a wonderful life and i really enjoy the versions of a christmas carol with george c. scott and alistair sim. but this particular movie is awful. i think the i love life song the ghost of christmas present sings is especially painful. albert finney sings fairly well in annie. i don't know whats wrong with him in this movie but it sounds as though someone is trying to sing through a mouthful of dead gerbils. the only thing that saved this movie for us was shutting the sound off and watching the dance numbers accompanied by the south park christmas cd. 
 I'll just put it out here that was the Worst sequel to a classic Disney film I've EVER seen. In 1950 Disney released what I hail as one of his greatest films of all time. Now Take away the great songs add a poor plot that resembles that of a lost TV show. Put it together and what do you get? the biggest load of Crud I've ever seen. After i saw this I thought it was all over for Disney. Cinderella should've ended with and they lived happily ever after. not this garbage. This film did not deserve a sequel like this. I thought it would be like A twist in time which was moderate but better than this. Also What do we care of Anastasia? She switched sides like Iago did but it didn't help anyone. 
 I tried as hard as I could to sit all the way through this irritating mess but I just couldn't do it. Brad Dourif absolutely sucked as the lead and all the supporting cast were only marginally worse. The whole thing is just ludicrous from the awful acting to the laughable FX to the stupid plot. Complete waste of time; don't bother. Root Canal therapy would be more enjoyable. Bamboo slivers under the fingernails would be a lot more pleasant. Watching a Uwe Boll movie would be only a little worse than this. Get the idea? 
 I don't think I've ever been so bowled over by the sheer absurdity of a movie in my entire life as i was when i walked out of this piece of crap. NOTHING in it makes any sense. none of it is clever or well thought out. out of lack of truly suspenseful moments they repeatedly use that total cop-out trick where you build up the music before the character does something like open a door or push aside a curtain and then nothing's there. thats OK to do once maybe but i counted three times. there are things thrown in for no apparent reason characters half-formed story lines.... the characters weren't well developed at ALL. the ending was.. bad. bad bad bad everything every component of this film is terrible. and I'm just here to warn you all of that. 
 After watching this movie on DVD I watched the trailer. The voice-over describes the movie as surreal. Well there's surreal and there's surreal. There was really only one part of the film that seemed surreal to me but frankly it was more confusing than surreal. The other unusual imagery particularly the lunchroom scene where everybody is on the floor were so nonsensical they had no meaning. I don't mind imagery that doesn't mean anything but these scenes just seemed irrelevant. My impression is that the director was trying to convey Logan's inner monologue. I don't know what else would explain what was going on. Unfortunately nothing I saw gave me any clue what Logan was thinking about what his perspective was or even his emotional state. All I could tell was that he wasn't particularly happy with his physical appearance and that he had a crush on an older boy. I thought the ending signaled what the relationship between the boys had become but not much else did. Purposely juxtaposing ambiguous scenes with those that were more straightforward seemed more like a cop out than an artistic decision. Still as tiresome and as content-free the movie was for me it was a definite change of pace. I very much liked Madagascar Skin and I had the feeling this movie aspired to that kind of narrative and perhaps even style. It didn't even come close. For me there's no question about it: this movie deserves an A for effort but a D for execution. 
 Before I start let me say that my experience of this movie might have been influenced by the dubbing which I gather from other comments was the original one which is considered inferior by some. So it is entirely possible that subtitles or the apparently new DVD version would make a difference. I have also not read the corresponding book; I'm only familiar with one other Japanese manga and might be lacking cultural context. Potential minor spoilers ahead. I usually like darkly tinged science fiction stories (the likes of Blade Runner 12 Monkeys etc.) but I did not enjoy this movie at all. While it started out mildly intriguing it became tedious by the time it was only half-way finished. There are all sorts of problems; let's start with what is probably the most severe: the dialogue. The characters seem unable to formulate complete sentences; if they aren't shouting each other's names for the n-th time they are usually grunting monosyllables ( Kanedaaa! Tetsuoooo! Huh? Grrr etc.). This leaves most of the characters entirely underdeveloped and two-dimensional. It doesn't help in the least that a lot of them get only a few minutes of screen time without anything interesting to say that would develop them away from the stereotypes suggested by the visuals. The grunting is augmented by some random pseudo-philosophical technobabble that sounds vague and uninspired even by Star Trek standards. There is nothing deep and meaningful here - it all seems haphazard thrown together at random from various bits and pieces of stock sci-fi ideas with no coherency whatsoever. What little there is of an intelligible plot is no more than an excuse to begin the overlong final sequence which consists of escalating scenes of mayhem and destruction. Not that there's anything wrong with a nice bit of mayhem and destruction of course; but in this case you'll find yourself asking what's the point of it all and how long until it's over . Character development in the last 30 minutes or so consists of little more than Tetsuo turning into Pizza the Hutt for no readily apparent reason. The ending resembles the one in 2001 - a bizarre string of images that far from resolving or explaining anything leave the viewer feeling he's just been looking into a kaleidoscope for two hours. I'm sure some will claim that this sort of thing is art; but to me it was just a lot of admittedly imaginative use of colour and shapes. (Some of the music was also quite interesting). Unfortunately it's all style and no substance. Tired of Disney? Want to watch animated movies dealing intelligently with adult themes? I'm sad to say you're more likely to find that sort of thing in South Park . 
 This esteemed production has it's fans. But to paraphrase the classic bad review of 'Mary Reilly ' Moby Dick is like a painting only slower. This is because the philosophical grounds for a movie production are never to make a great film rather it's to substitute the lack of a strong guiding idea (in this case for a books transference to film) with a list of hopelessly atomized undynamic but dazzling conceits in an effort to trick viewers into thinking they've seen greatness. As viewers & critics are apt to fall for this Oscars follow feeding the whole dumb equation. I don't share in the pleasure all these reviewers found. Moby Dick is stunningly uninvolving. Actors dutifully recite essays about Jonah Moby Dick the ocean Moby Dick Moby Dick... all things that can't respond and not one of which is absorbing in the slightest. It's dramatically inert. It doesn't build. In narrative terms Moby Dick (as a movie) is little more than a foregone conclusion in search of an actual story. After half an hour I was muttering Oh terrific... another oath ...another 4 minute soliloquy! In the failed effort to involve you it's a pretty campy overacting showcase. A lot of grey hair here. Starbuck is supposed to be a golden god. (!) One knows one is looking at a great director when he makes the medium his own rather than trying to replicate the feel of someone else's paintings & palette or reverently embalming a classic as Huston does here. Paintings and books are nice but they're a different mediums. A movie like this fails to grasp that an honestly enjoyable piece of crap (Village of the Damned) is better in most respects than an insufferable piece of culture. This is the Eat Your Vegetables school of film-making. One appreciates the work that must have been done to make the movie but not the narrative. Only a few segments reflecting maritime research are interesting; the recording of shanties as a means of structuring work & various sea efforts; and the technology of whaling. And that doesn't call for a two-plus hour movie. 
 Absolutely horrific film. Ameteurish and it isn't funny at all. Lead character played by Mehmet Ali Erbil is very annoying. Edits by E.T and star wars is just plain stupid. Actor Yilmaz Goksal is the only good think about this movie. He should master his English and move to Hollywood. Hollywood can not find an actor with his qualities. Other than Goksal this movie is a garbage. Director Gani Mujde is a comic writer and this movie is his worst written work to this date. Music of Cem Karaca is another plus of this waste of money. Actor Sumer Tilmac also have some presence. Actor who plays the three sons has no talent what so ever. 
 It seems that the intention of the film was to show the aggressive (maffia-like) character of Russians or at least of those Russians able to travel outside their big country; that it is too easy to rob a bank in England; and that British police is so inefficient that it cannot find the person who robbed the bank even when these subjects are leaving the country by air. In addition Nicole Kidman and the supposed Russian colleagues spoke a language not yet identified anywhere probably spoken by Aliens in the Ural mountains but far to be the Russian one. So Nicole if you really want to talk Russian kindly go to Moscow or St. Petersburg and keep yourself busy learning Russian language grammar and its pronunciation. 
 I attempted to watch this film without being able to really sit through it for while it is suppose to have a good message; the problem is that it is obviously produced according to one particular interpretation of scripture. An interpretation in my opinion will mislead a lot of people. In addition I am a movie maniac and the acting in this film was completely unacceptable. Never before had I wished for a negative score to rate a movie. So if you wish to be preached to incessantly by those without authority then by all means get this film. This comment is also a warning to people who like or love scifi because the title will deceive a lot of people as well. This was an unfortunate film because the basic idea had possibilities and those possibilities were squandered. The film's only redeemable quality is that it did make me realize that the character in the Time Machine probably should have shown a little more moral outrage at the odd behavior by those in his future. 
 Intrigued by the synopsis (every gay video these days has a hunk on the cover; this is not necessarily to be construed as a good sign) I purchased BEN AND ARTHUR without knowing a thing about it. This is my second (and I assure you it will be my last) purchase of a CULTURE Q CONNECTION video. As far as I am concerned this DVD is nothing but a blatant rip-off. I do not make this observation lightly ? I am a major collector of videos gay and mainstream and I can state with some authority and without hesitation that BEN AND ARTHUR is quite simply the worst film I have ever sat through in my life. Period. My collection boasts over 1 600 films (93% on them on DVD) and of those well over 300 are gay and lesbian themed. I hardly own every gay movie ever made but I am comfortable in stating that I pretty much purchase almost every gay video of interest that gets released and very often I buy videos without knowing anything about the film. Sometimes this makes for a pleasant surprise - Aimee & Jaguar It's In The Water Urbania and Normal are all examples of excellent gay titles that I stumbled upon accidentally. So when I read on the box that BEN AND ARTHUR concerned a conflict between gay lovers and the Christian Right one of my favorite subjects I decided to take the plunge sight unseen despite my previously disappointing purchase of another CULTURE Q CONNECTION title VISIONS OF SUGAR PLUMS. That film was pretty bad but compared to BEN AND ARTHUR it viewed like GONE WITH THE WIND. So what was so wrong with BEN AND ARTHUR? Plenty! To begin with the plot such as it was was totally ridiculous. This film almost made me sympathetic to the Christian Right ? we are asked to believe not only that a church would expel a member because his brother is gay but that a priest would actually set up a mob style execution of a gay couple in order to save their souls (like this even makes sense). The writing is so poor that many scenes make no sense at all and several plot points reflect no logic follow-up or connection to the story. Murder and violence seem to be acceptable ends to the gay activist / right wing conflict on both sides and the acting is so bad that it's difficult to imagine how anybody in this film got hired. The characters who are supposed to be straight are almost without exception clearly gay - and nelly stereotypes to boot; the gay characters are neither sexy nor interesting. This film is enough to put off anybody from buying gay themed videos forever and the distributors should be ashamed of themselves. The only advantage this picture has over my other CULTURE Q Connection purchase VISIONS OF SUGARPLAMS is that this one has a soundtrack with clear dialogue. Hardly a distinction since the script is so insipid that understanding the script only serves to make you more aware of how bad this film truly is. It is an embarrassment to Queer culture and I intend to warn everyone I possibly can before they waste their money on it. At $9.95 this film would have been way overpriced; I understand that it's soon to be re-priced under $20 which is STILL highway robbery. I paid the original price of $29.95 and I never felt more cheated in my life. The only true laugh connected with this drivel is the reviews ? I have seen user reviews for this film on numerous websites and there is always one or two that praise the director / writer / actor in such a way that it's obvious that the reviewer is a friend of this Ed Wood wannabe. How sad. How desperate. I just wish IMDb would allow you to assign zero stars - or even minus zero. If ever a film deserved it this is it. 
 Words really can't describe how bad this film is. I thought Zandalee was bad but at least that had some nice shots and the occasional good chin stroking moment here and there to stop you from nodding off. This is just laughable! Terrible script poor direction awful acting and you know what? I can't think of a single thing to recommend about it other than the fact that it isn't too long. If you want 100 minutes worth of entertainment book yourself in at the dentist and have some root canal work - far more enjoyable and much better value for money (assuming that you need it!). Incidentally I need to type 10 lines of text to complete this review - PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. IT IS TERRIBLE! 
 I agree with most of the Columbo fans that this movie was an unnecessary change of format. Columbo is a unique cop with unorthodox police methods. This movie looks like a remake of any other ordinary detective dramas from the past. And that is the disturbing point because Columbo is no ordinary detective. There are two parts in this film that left me intriguing. First I can't figure out the title of this movie. It is misleading. Maybe a better title would've been The Vanishing Bride or something similar. Second Columbo hides a piece of evidence without offering the reason (to the viewers at least) why he does it. I don't feel betrayed just disappointed. I'm glad Peter Falk went back to the usual Columbo. 
 **WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILER** If you can get by the extremely unpleasant subject matter this film does offer a heaping helping of outrageously campy melodrama. Surprisingly enough this movie has been copied and ripped-off several times over the years although it's hard to fathom ANY filmmaker being inspired by this trashy drama. Neither one of the Hemingway women can act here (although Mariel HAS improved over the years) Anne Bancroft offers the only touch of class as a prosecuting attorney and Chris Sarandon is by turns pathetic and unintentionally hilarious as the smirking smarmy bad guy of the piece. Veteran director Lamont Johnson can't make a silk purse out of this sow's ear of a script which is stuffed to bursting with howlingly bad dialogue and outlandish situations. For example the final sequence where Margaux grabs her shotgun and chases Sarandon down after his latest shocking act is meant to be exciting but elicits hearty chuckles instead. Add a notoriously shrill and spacy musical score by Michel Polnareff and you have a true guilty pleasure even though you're likely to feel grubby and needing a hot shower after viewing it. Don't say you weren't warned. 
 Most would agree that the character of Wolverine is one of the most intriguing characters in comic book history. I'm no Marvel expert but I did grow up with the adventures of the X-Men and definitely approved of Hugh Jackman's now widely known portrayal of the scruffy Logan. I enjoyed the first X-Men found the sequel too heavy and messy and liked the third one as comic book entertainment. All through the three movies I probably enjoyed Jackman more than anything else. I figured the idea of making an origins -movie about Wolverine could very well end up being a better movie than all of the three X-Men movies. If we concentrate on one character I figured there could be a movie that achieves what I found the second movie failed at - being a fairly complex and character driven comic book adventure. The reason that the Wolverine-movie fails is not because the competition is tougher after The Dark Knight. It's not even because of a plot development that is beyond obvious and rudimentary - even though that certainly isn't good - no it's because the movie doesn't even seem to try. To begin with this does not qualify as good entertainment. There is something about the action in this movie that comes off as so very very automatic. With no greater special effects or elements of suspense and when one event will make you predict the following five it almost feels like an Uwe Boll movie imitating an action/adventure movie concept that you've seen a dozen times before. Of course nothing in this movie is as downright awful as a piece of Bolls**t but when everybody's talking clichs as if they are part of a chain of events that is so standard you at least make the connection and that surely is bad enough. But there is an even bigger problem. Even a generic action movie is a generic action movie and by the way that makes you forgive a lot of plot holes and character stupidities. I think you find the most fundamental flaw in the very title. I mean Origins . Really? What to the people behind this movie think about that title? What do they mean?? You want to know the origins of Wolverine? He grew up with his brother. They ran away from home during dramatic circumstances. Then they went off to war. All of them! The Civil War World War I and II and Vietnam too. Why did they do this? Still unknown. Eventually the brother (Sabertooth played by Liev Shrieber) became evil. How? you ask. I don't know it was somewhere between Omaha Beach and Hanoi. Yeah but why? you still ask. I just said I don't know!! The movie doesn't explain. He's evil alright! Yeah but... you know 'origins' ... Yeah well that's an origin! I mean duh! Anyway eventually they end up with a super secret team of mutant elite soldiers. Something with the government ho-hum. Wolvie gets enough and leave his brother. For six years he's a happy lumberjack with a loved one who ends up a little defenseless around the time Sabretooth suddenly appears again. Yeaaah... but... whyyyy? - Oh shut up! - and Wolvie decides to be a guinneapig for a bunch of evil scientist who make him a flesh-covered metal war animal. He goes after all the bad guys and they come after him and after all the fighting he ends up with his memory wiped cue X-Men the first movie. There. That's the origin. You can also find it on the back of the DVD cover. The actual movie won't tell you anything else. With no worthwhile scenes of action no good heroes villains or characters in general (lines from my couch audience: Fat suit! Token black guy! Oh I give you 200 in cash if that girl survives this movie.. That is supposed to be Gambit...? mmhm yeah well... uh-huh right) not one line of memorable dialog and zero lines to cover a T-shirt with added to that the common stupid things that ruin the plausibility in general that you might usually forgive...... well that sounds pretty much like a waste of time right? Fans will check this out or have already. There's no stopping that. But if you liked the X-Men movies for no other reason than that they were well-made and entertaining - see them again and do yourself no favors by trying to look for origins where there are none. 
 *WARNING. THERE MIGHT BE SPOILERS AHEAD IF YOU CARE.* Okay the basic premise of this homegrown Texas film is: College kids + spookhouse + evil magic book = scary stuff. In practice it equals a lot of time looking at the time to see how much longer this movie is going to drag on. A bunch of frat boys along with assorted girlfriends & volunteers is setting up a charity haunted house. The project is being presided over by a thoroughly repellent character whose main purpose seems to be verbally & physically assaulting as many cast members as possible. I had a hard time believing that anyone would even attempt to work with this person in any capacity: he's nothing but rude and abusive to everyone including his girlfriend and his buddy. Regardless the kids are visited by local character & annual pumpkin-carving champion Pumpkin Jack an elderly coot who is described as the Santa Claus of Halloween and who drops off a load of props for the house including an ominous book that figured prominently in the irritatingly strobe-flashed prologue(where a gaggle of robed cultists get turned into stir-fry). Needless to say some damn fool starts messing with the book and eventually most of the costumed monsters turn into real ones and the remaining few normal folk have to try and survive. There's some good stuff in this film but not much: everything is shot well and the makeup effects are decent. On the other hand the performers either underact or overact drastically; much of the plot makes little sense outside of a this happens so that can happen series; there is hardly any musical score to speak of just snatches of songs throughout the film; and the movie takes an hour to actually get anywhere. That last problem is the most telling: two-thirds of the 90 minute running time is used to repeatedly set up the characters. Tom is a nice guy dating Heidi the control freak but he used to date Jill who is now dating Dan the jerk but she's started a relationship Kira the girl who wears too many shawls/capes. Dan is a really big jerk Gary likes to play jokes and Steve & Lily like to have a lot of sex. Stuff that could have easily been dealt with in 20 minutes or so drags on and on to the point where the lesbian sex scene(calm down it's pretty tame) left me looking for the fast forward button. That leaves us with half an hour of lo-calorie scares a klunky ending and a deep-seated dislike of ol' Pumpkin Jack who I blame for the whole mess. Unless you can get this on some sort of deep-discount rental(and really have seen everything else in the store) put it back on the shelf and keep looking. 
 This one is bad. A really bad and boring crime movie that has nothing out of the ordinary in it. A series of crimes the killer that you do not see throughout the whole movie the classic investigations. And also the classic tale about a cop who figures out what's going on and isn't believed by anyone so he has to fight by himself to reveal the truth. Not too much in this one. Vote: 4 out of 10. 
 I am Puerto Rican and this is one of the worst documentary of I've ever seen of any type. You can see that the people on it are clueless. They don't know much about Puerto Rico and its culture. They claim to be Puerto Rican because they are from Puerto Rican descendants but they probably know less than others who are not from there. You can see while they are talking that they are contradicting themselves. If you would like to see a real and I mean a real genuine documentary from Puerto Rico then you must see Mi Puerto Rico . That's a serious real documentary. Not like this piece of junk. Rosie Perez based this documentary on herself. I thought it was suppose to be about Puerto Ricans. They keep repeating I didn't know. Well that's about the only thing they got right on this so called documentary. I hate to see such a piece of garbage being done using the name of the Island. It brings down the standards. 
 I like Billy Crystal and I thought it would be fun to watch this film since I know he admired Alan King and they would be funny together. I thought I had seen all Billy's movies but couldn't remember this one and now I know why. It's so full of clichs and phony emotion; you can smell each scene coming (and going!). Billy doesn't even get to be funny very often. He's too busy trying to cry fake tears or show his angst at how badly his father let him down. Alan King himself is fairly likable as is the subplot about being an extra in the movies. But what a coincidence that Billy just happens to visit his father just as a major health crisis takes place etc. etc. Or that two busy doctors can just shut down their practices to moon around in LA. And when the end comes boy does it come quickly! Almost as though the writers realized they had painted themselves into a corner and the only way out was to do a death scene. Mostly disappointing with a few glimmers of good humor. 
 Much of Over Her Dead Body is so painfully unfunny that I was actually squirming in my seat out of embarrassment for the actors. Eva Longoria proves that she can't carry a film in this terrible romantic comedy and further that she doesn't really even have any comedic timing. She's grating and annoying as a ghost who returns to earth to keep a cooky psychic from dating her widower fianc. The fianc is played by Paul Rudd drippy and charmless while the psychic is played by Lake Bell bringing the movie whatever anemic energy it has. I felt most sorry for Bell as she appears to have some comic abilities and was working overtime in an effort to make the material work. Unfortunately she is up against the insurmountable task of making any movie that features Jason Biggs tolerable and she is dragged down with the rest of the cast like Leo DiCaprio at the end of Titanic. Over Her Dead Body actually pi**ed me off because of its laziness and utter lack of effort. I started to think of all the interesting projects that can't get funded because vast amounts of money are being funneled into bland crap like this. Seriously does Hollywood think movies like this are good enough? How stupid do they really think the movie-going public is? Grade: F 
 I was mad anyone made this movie. I was even more angry I lost valuable minutes of my life sitting still to watch this. I could have had a wax job and been more entertained. At least Cherri makes me laugh before it hurts. I was a bit confused at first but then I caught on and realized what was going on. By this time the film was half way through and Yes I am a procrastinator but I always want to see things through until the end. So I stuck it out I watched it all. Not only are the actors not as attractive as in Cruel Intentions they just aren't convincing. I've seen my nephew cry for attention more convincingly than the supposed lust portrayed on screen in this movie. If you like bad movies with bad acting watch this. 
 Are you kidding me?! A show highlighting someone who opens cans and envelopes for a meal? How talented do you have to be to do this? She MAY be able to cook but it is NOT portrayed in this half-hour stomach churning painful production. I know she has a Martha-Stewart-esquire empire. So does Warren Buffett but I don't see him with fake knockers opening cans of cream corn and Alpo. She has a nephew named...Brycer. Brycer? Stop talking about anyone a name that stupid. More time is spent on table-scapes than actual cooking. Who has that kind of time?! Silicon should be on your spatula not on my TV. This show should be on Cartoon Network NOT Food Network. 
 Ridiculous. This movie is actually a vehicle for the Ramtha School of Enlightenment. If you are wondering who the *bleep* Ramtha is: Ramtha is a 35 000 year-old spirit-warrior who appeared in J.Z. Knight's kitchen in Tacoma Washington in 1977. Knight claims that she is Ramtha's channel. She also owns the copyright to Ramtha and conducts sessions in which she pretends to go into a trance and speaks Hollywood's version of Elizabethan English in a guttural husky voice. She has thousands of followers and has made millions of dollars performing as Ramtha at seminars ($1 000 a crack) and at her Ramtha School of Enlightenment and from the sales of tapes books and accessories (Clark and Gallo 1993). She must have hypnotic powers. Searching for self-fulfillment otherwise normal people obey her command to spend hours blindfolded in a cold muddy doorless maze. John Wheeler one of America's finest theoretical physicists would roll his eyes about this movie. He has in the recent past criticized parapsychologists for their misuse and misinterpretations of quantum theory. This movie does the same thing as those fools. There is a great review of this movie at Skeptico. I recommend anyone considering watching this movie read it first before contributing to a cult's coffers. http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/04/what_the_bleep_.html I noticed one reviewer here at IMDb say to take this movie with a grain of salt. It will take enough salt to kill a horse to wade through the garbage-thinking of this movie. 
 Having low expectations going in the opening new footage (clocked at over five minutes) of 'Husbands' came as a pleasant surprise. I won't say the new footage was grade A material but it provided a very solid foundation for what could have been a good all-original film. Unfortunately this was put together in 1955 during a time of one day shooting schedules. After the new footage Jules White decided to just thumbtack stock footage from 'Brideless Groom' into this short making for a not-so-smooth story transition which Jules and Felix Adler try to remedy with a quickie bit of new footage at the end giving us the old worn-out ending of the boys (Moe & Larry in this case) getting shot in the butt. 3/10 
 Kings and Queen is a bloated French drama that rambles on for an interminable two hours and thirty-two minutes to no discernible point or purpose. The film features two stories that seem unrelated at first but which eventually connect with one another about halfway through the movie. The first centers around Nora and her struggles with various men in her life including an elderly father who discovers he has only a few days left to live. The other story involves a young man named Ismael a violinist who finds himself placed - unfairly he believes - in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party. After traveling along on separate tracks for awhile these two narrative strands eventually come together when we learn that Ismael is a former lover of Nora's and the man she has chosen to adopt her son from an earlier tragic relationship. With a bit more focus and a considerable amount of streamlining Kings and Queen might have been a potent engrossing drama about modern day relationships. It certainly has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power and the performances are for the most part complex and touching. But taken as a whole the film meanders and maunders to such an extent that quite frankly it begins to wreak havoc on our patience and to wear out its welcome early on. Even more distressing is the fact that even though we spend what seems like a mild eternity in the company of these people we really don't know quite what to make of any of them when the show is finally over. For instance Nora's father on his deathbed writes a withering diatribe against his daughter's character that simply doesn't gibe with the woman we've been looking at for well over two hours. Nora is admittedly no Mother Theresa (then again who is?) but she certainly doesn't deserve the invective thrown at her by her very own father. Nora could be accused of being confused indecisive a bit self-absorbed at times but evil enough to have her father wishing he could give her his cancer and make her die in his place? I don't think so. Perhaps this film is simply operating at a level of depth that I was unable to fathom. But my suspicion is that even writer Roger Bohbot and co-writer/director Arnaud Desplechin would have trouble fully explaining their purpose here. This is a well acted pretentious bore of a film that takes the viewer on a long rambling voyage through a sea of personal crises a journey that leaves him no wiser or more enlightened at the end than he was at the beginning. 
 I rated this movie a 1 since the plot is so unbelievable unbelievable. Judge for yourself. Be warned the following will not only give away the plot but will also spoil your appetite for watching the movie. A computer virus designed by a frustrated nerd sends out a code through television screens and computer monitors. When the code - in the form of light - enters the eye it can access the 'electrical system' of your body. What it does is forcing the body cells into excretion of calcium. Within seconds after infection the patient reaches for his neck develops tunnel vision his skin will turn white of the calcium after which he falls and his hand and scull will crack in a cloud of chalk. This virus is very intelligent. When it finds out that a blind computer expert is trying to disassemble the code with a braille output device - operated by hands - the device is set on a very high voltage which causes severe burning wounds on the skin of the expert's head. The virus also senses aggression against remote controls and the keyboard of an ATM. Fortunately it could be stopped by throwing over outdated desktop pc's in a rack and electrocuting the nerd with his back on a broken computer and his feet in some spilled water. Oh dear... 
 It was probably just my DVD---but I would not recommend that anyone try to watch this picture on a DVD. I had to turn up the volume on my TV to the highest possible level in order to hear about 80 percent of the dialog. Some of the talking still remained sub-audible. If you're from Scotland you might have a chance albeit a slim one. Peoples voices were drowned out by nearly all ambient sounds including unwrapping a package footsteps even puffing on a cigarette. With the volume turned up to a level at which voices can be heard I can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will phone the police when the scene changes to a loud environment such as a disco. And that you will injure yourself diving for the remote to turn it back down. There is art and there is art even in the field of audio mixing. But this effort in a time of war would meet international criteria to be classified as an atrocity. After about a half hour I gave up having seen nothing else redeeming in the picture either. 
 Before writing this review I went back and reread the reviews of others. This movie was a particular disappointment to me since it features two of my favorite dancers Gene Kelly and George Chakiris boasts a score by the often wonderous Michel LeGrand ( Wuthering Heights Ice Station Zebra The Thomas Crowne Affair ). The dancing was stilted unmotivated and unoriginal the songs forgettable the story a joke. Even the costuming was not particularly flattering. Only the photography correctly captured the proper mood and spirit. I'm glad other people enjoyed The Young Girls of Rochefort though I most certainly did not. 
 DVD has become the equivalent of the old late night double-bill circuit the last chance to catch old movies on the verge of being completely forgotten like The Border. There were great expectations for this back in 1982 ? a script co-written by The Wild Bunch's Walon Green Jack Nicholson in the days when he could still act without semaphore and a great supporting cast (Harvey Keitel Warren Oates Valerie Perrine) Tony Richardson directing (although he was pretty much a spent force by then) ? but now it doesn't even turn up on TV. The material certainly offers a rich seam of possibilities for comment on the 80s American Dreams of capitalism and conspicuous consumption with Nicholson's border patrolman turning a blind eye to the odd drug deal or bit of people trafficking to finance his wife's relentless materialism until he rediscovers his conscience when he finds out his partners are also in the baby selling business. Unfortunately he never really gets his hands dirty barely even turning a blind eye before his decency rises to the surface. The film feels always watered down as if too many rewrites and too many committees have left it neutered and sadly the recent DVD release is a missed opportunity to restore the original nihilistic ending where Nicholson goes over the edge and firebombs the border patrol station that was cut after preview audiences found it too downbeat but which still featured prominently in the film's trailers. While that probably wasn't too convincing considering how low-key Nicholson's crisis of conscience is in the film it had to be better than the crude reshot climax where the film abandons logic and even basic rules of continuity: at one point he's holding characters at gunpoint then he's somewhere else and they're free trying to kill him one character goes from injured at his house to hopping around like a gazelle on the banks of the Rio Grande while Valerie Perrine's character gets dumber on an exponential level. The villains of the piece are disposed of with absurd ease (and one impressive car stunt) in time for a clumsily edited happy ending and you start wondering if you somehow found yourself watching another film entirely. What makes it all the more clumsy is that the rest of the film is so flat and underwhelming that the sudden lurch into melodrama is all the more jarring. Unfortunately Ry Cooder's beautiful title song Across the Borderline says it all much more economically. But if you want to know the film's real crime it's completely wasting the great Warren Oates in a nothing bit part. When even he can't make an impression you know something's really wrong. All in all all too easy to remember why I found this so forgettable at the time. 
 The clichd Polynesian males drink fight and make a stream of sexist stupid and unfunny remarks. Real life Polynesians are much funnier than these stereotyped cardboard characters. The supposedly Samoan girl didn't look or act Samoan at all seemed more like the stock white female who has sex with anyone on a whim. With weak as water story lines you can't say anything about the acting - even the most brilliant actors could do nothing with this script. It's sad to see Polynesian actors willing to play such sad stereotypes in a film with not one good scene and only two or three 'jokes'. What a waste of Kiwi taxpayers' money what a lost opportunity to make a great film about a vibrant community. It's better not to make movies if they're as bad and mindless as this. 
 Description: Corny utterly stupid and worthless. It's so cheap and lame it'll make you wonder why these abnormally dumb people even wasted 2 months or so to spend a budget (I'm guessing this...) probably no more than 700 dollars to make this movie. It was just hysterical to watch with or without Mystery Science Theater. I am giving you the best advice in the world: Spare yourself spare your time life and money by NOT--I repeat NOT even ponder about whether you should see this movie. This movie is so corny it'll make your face turn purple of outraged boredom. If you have a one-digit IQ then be my guest and watch this absolutely despicable movie. You might actually admire it. (Like I said before IF you have a one-digit IQ) With about 12 actors of your own a few puppets you bought at a garage sale and of course cameras and music I gaurentee you'll make a slightly more entertaining home video than this piece of absolute crap. 
 Up until the last few minutes of the movie I would have given the movie a score of 7 or 8 stars. However the ending is so terrible and Hollywoodized that it completely undermines the first 80% of the movie. The plot revolves around a submarine and the possibility that they received an order to fire their nuclear missiles. The Captain Gene Hackman is all for launching while his first officer Denzel Washington is in favor of confirming the launch orders first. The problem is to launch BOTH the captain and 1st officer must simultaneously use their launch keys. Hackman is determined to launch and Washington stands firm until eventually this results in armed insurrection aboard the sub. Eventually the mistake is discovered and the missiles are not launched. Cool. However here comes the part that just doesn't ring true. After they are back on land and go before a review board Washington and Hackman (who'd just spent half the movie trying to kill each other) shake hands and are all buddy buddy! Huh?! Too trite an ending to make the movie worth while for me. 
 this movie had a lot of blood in it when the sabretooth attack it also i loved it when that guy and the women were having some good time and then the sabretooth attacked the women and ate her stomach and took the liver out. that was the best and the 1ton sabretooth walking on its front legs hilarious to make this movie better more action and less talking if you know what i mean and also please please people who made this movie don't make anothwer movie like this movies ending cause it was terrible 1 sabretooth alive and killed that women in the end this movie reminds me of the grudges ending always there's 1 enemy left! OK damn it this movie sucks i can 't believe it i loved it when my lil bro got freaked from the attacks stomach takin out and the blood ya 
 Yuck! And again I say...YUCK! The original version of this movie was a well directed story of a man who was already dead and driving through purgatory. The original movie had a lot to say and didn't go out of its way to say it. And it had a naked chick on a motorcycle. This version strikes me as something that a producer bought the rights to and then abandoned out of disinterest. It looks as if a group of individuals consciously decided to fit it to the nineties and changed ethnicities and genders just to be cute. The movie is not about a burnout about to commit suicide in a last act of defiance. It is about a man trying to get to a hospital to see his wife. There was no reason for this movie to have been made other than to make me angry... 
 In a college dorm a guy is killed by somebody with a scythe. His girlfriend Beth (Dorie Barton) discovers him and tries to commit suicide. She's institutionalized. A year later she's out has a new boyfriend named Hank (Joseph Lawrence) and is about to spend Spring Break with Hank and four other mindless friends in a BIG beautiful condo in Florida. Naturally the killer pops up (for no reason) and starts killing again. Lousy slasher thriller--a textbook example of how NOT to do a low-budget horror movie. For starters large portions of this film are ENDLESS filler of these six idiots videotaping themselves having fun (more fun than the audience) getting drunk acting stupid etc etc. Also there is NO nudity in here at all. I'm not saying a horror film needs nudity but ANYTHING to liven this up would have helped. None of the deaths are really shown (you hear them) are only a little bloody and there is no gore. There's one REAL gruesome one--but that's not till the end. With a few exceptions the acting sucks. Dorie Barton is dreadful as the main woman and Tom Jay Jones is lousy as Oz. Chad Allen pops up as Brad and he's TERRIBLE. Lawrence is actually very good--handsome and hunky and giving this crap his all. And Jeff Conaway pops up in a small role doing a pretty good job. Logic lapses abound--after they realize a friend has been killed two of the girls casually talk about sex; Baston's non reaction to seeing a friend getting killed is kind of funny and WHAT happens to Lawrence? His character disappears without a trace at the end! Dull stupid no gore no nudity--skip this one. Rated R for Graphic Violence and some Profanity. 
 ... and I actually gave it a ZERO on my personal 1-10 scale. I have been attending movies since 1952 and have seen well over 1000 in the theater (I don't rate movies that I see only on TV). This is the ONLY movie I have ever rated ZERO. My wife and I took our four children (then aged 15 11 8 and 6) and even the kids thought it was terrible. In fact it was my daughter (now 26) who alerted me to this site (amazed that the movie was getting an overall rating of 4+). The animation of the dinosaurs looked amateurish at the time (and is even worse in retrospect) the acting (particularly by Sean Young) is atrocious and the story line is simply silly. 
 Republic pictures comes late in the game to the werewolf er Werecat genre. The plot has a writer returning to Paris after a long trip abroad during which he developed jungle fear during which he had blackouts. He is arriving to great acclaim as his novel that parallels an infamous trial is a best seller. The French government wants to know if he had access to secret documents something that seems more likely when an official is killed by a catman . Suspicion really falls on the writer when his fianc ends up dead. Complicating matters is the return of the blackouts so the writer doesn't know if he's the killer or not. Okay thriller is much too leisurely to be fully enjoyed. There are too many musical numbers early on and too much dead time when things are all talk in the middle and later sections. The acting is fine and the sets quite good but there is a reason why most people I know only remember the top hatted killer he's the most interesting thing in this film. despite its short running time (just over an hour) I think the reason that this film was rarely seen on TV was that after 20 minutes you begin to lose patience with it. As good as the talk is I just wished someone would do something. When it finally did happen in the closing minutes it was too little too late.. Take a pass. 
 I saw this movie with low expectations and was not disappointed. Its so bad that it is actually funny in a very cringe worthy way. Gael is absolutely terrible I mean he just cannot act period. He should give up now as acting is clearly not his thing.. His co-stars are about the same caliber i'm sure my 5 year old cousin could do a better job than all of them! The director should be ashamed to have put his name on something so ridiculous.. Somehow I don't think an Oscar is on the cards for this guy. I have never written a comment on IMDb but this movie was so bad I felt compelled to do so. If you get the chance to see this film don't 0/10 if there was a 0 
 I bought this on DVD for my brother who is a big Michelle Pfeiffer fan. I decided to watch it myself earlier this week. It is a reasonably entertaining piece containing two completely separate story lines. The section with Michelle Pfeiffer was by far the more interesting of the two. She plays a rising Hollywood actress who has had many short unfulfilling relationships. She literally bumps into Brian Kerwin (A regular married guy with Kids)after driving her car into the back of his. After being initially hostile to one another he offers to drive her home as she no longer feels comfortable to drive. Romance develops eventually leading to tragedy when his wife finds out. What happens at the end I was not prepared for but the slow pacing and routine TV direction takes any drama out of the plot. The other section involves an old Studio boss played by Darren McGavin. This section actually has the better cast with Kenneth McMillan Lois Chiles Steven Bauer & Stella Stevens. They all want something from the studio boss but in the end when he is asked to resign they all realize their careers will now be going nowhere. It passes the time but is not all that interesting and I am glad this was not bought for me. I am not a Michelle Pffeifer fan but she was admittedly the only actor worth watching in this film and even in 1983 she was a decent actress. Overall though unless you are a fan of hers avoid this as it is very routine. 
 Ouch! They don't come much worse than this horrid adaptation of C. S. Lewis's beloved novel. While the adaptation is very true to the novel the acting is simply awful and the sets and special effects are on a scale equivalent to a school play. I've read that the budget for this miniseries was the grandest that the BBC has ever given at the time but surely they could have scraped together a bit more than the $2 that it looks like this was filmed for. The worst effect of all is Mr. Beaver. I know computer effects weren't at the level necessary or even cost effective at the time but the costume store man in a suit look was horrid. Better to have just cut the character from the film than do that to the role! Avoid this at all costs. 
 The subject matter seems pretty dated today. Adapted for TV from Rona Jaffe's book; we trip and stumble through a fantasy existence. Four college students get deeply involved playing a live version of the board game Mazes and Dragons (based on Dungeons and Dragons). One player a young Tom Hanks enters the fantasy world too deep. His co-players must come to his rescue and save him from self inflicted harm. David Wallace Wendy Crewson and Chris Makepeace round out the game's foursome. Support cast is made up of veteran actors like Murray Hamilton Vera Miles Anne Francis and Susan Strasberg. At this date it seems lumbering and tame. But the highlight of watching is seeing Tom Hanks between his Bosom Buddies salad days and his big splash in SPLASH on the silver screen. The youngest of viewer will get most enjoyment. 
 First of all I'd like to tell you that I'm into comics anime animation and such stuff. It is true that everyone has his own preferences but you can trust me on this movie. I'll be objective. To begin with the story - it's OK. Follows the story line of the comic books as far as I'm familiar with them. But the animation... Well it's not actually terrible but it's definitely cheap and mediocre. It would be a lot better if they didn't try to imitate the anime style and sticked to the original comic book style drawings. If we pretend not to see the rare sloppy effects like fire and lightnings you could tell that the movie is made about 10 years ago and even more. Looks a little bit like the original Vampire Hunter D from 1985. Take a look at Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 for instance - 4 years ago they made a movie that looks a hell lot better! In addition to this the voice talents do nothing remarkable the music is nothing special. So all in all - it lacks atmosphere. I watched it but I cannot tell I really enjoyed it. It just does not capture you. There's plenty of blood and violence but that does not impress me at all. May be it will be shocking for someone who was never watched more mature oriented animations and sees animated blood for the first time (is there anyone around?) but I don't think this is the audience for this movie. So they could add a little nudity and spice to it. The chicks around Lucifer were quite tasty and hell we have Lady Death herself! There are few sexy looks but that's not enough. Instead of Bill Brown's music I think it would look better on a hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack. All in all - the movie isn't that bad but if you want something better take the original Heavy Metal Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 Ralph Bakshi's Fire and Ice or Wizards maybe. And of course - Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust 
 Well let me start off by saying how utterly HILARIOUS this film is I simply couldn't keep myself from laughing at the sheer stupidity of it. Don't get me wrong it IS well acted particularly by Bassinger but the script is just well the mind boggles truly. The premise is good and up until Della actually witnesses the murder it is engaging but after that it just goes downhill . Half way through the film the protagonist pulls out her toolbox and of course instead of lobbing it at the guy's head she decides to pull out a screwdriver car jack and finally a flare (as in for a sinking ship) respectively to kill her victims. Then there is the final line that I promise if it doesn't have you in stitches then I will eat my own left foot. I would recommend this film to those who simply want to laugh at some good old fashioned appalling film making. Might I also suggest you watch out for the scene in the scrap yard with the guy falling from the one foot high plank of wood gets me every time. 
 Except for acknowledging some nice cinematography I can hardly say anything positive about this movie. The single real issue is the protagonist's dilemma whether to remain with his childhood friends in the world of misery or to leave them and take up his own life. Abundant emotionally powerful scenes do not go with this plot and because of bad acting they also fail to create the intended atmosphere. The director only manages to introduce Anthony's dilemma and eventually brings an easy solution. The characters do not seem to evolve although it is difficult to speak of any characters... perhaps except for Sonny. Beside him actors do not get to play much and when some of them have to they come off as self-indulging amateurs. I wonder what ruined the movie more: the superficial script throwing away all the potential of the plot or the bad acting disturbing any appeal that might be left. 
 ...the first film I had to walk out on. And it was the cast and crew pre-screening (Not that I was involved I hasten to add). I made it through the first hour so I reckon I'm just qualified to comment but that was my limit. Like other comments here how did this get through any kind of QA. An accumulation of the very worst in dialogue the epitome of wooden acting awful casting all wrapped together without a plot. Tara Fitzgerald's casting was bizarre almost comic. She possesses the worst Russian accent in movie history. As I left the screening the director and producers were drinking in a bar outside the cinema. They obviously couldn't sit through it again either. 
 I ended up watching this movie before even going through any of the reviews on the request of a female. Just out of curiosity I thought let me find out if there are people who actually recommend others to watch this movie. I am quite shocked to find such long and positive reviews on this website that makes me conclude that it's a scam. As far as my opinion goes I have to ask are these filmmakers retarded or do they assume that the viewers are retarded? The movie is atrocious on so many levels and I'm not even talking about the story or presentation. So these bunch of guys plus one girl (the lead actress) form a Music band; guessing from the constant presence of guitars it is supposed to be a ROCK band. Hell when did dancers started becoming the part of a Rock band??? Anyway let me accept it as the-Bollywood-version-of-a- Rock-band but amusingly enough all the scores which actually had these two guitarists doing all kinds of cool ROCK GESTURES and I am assuming they were playing the instruments the sound of the guitar was completely missing!!! I simply can't comprehend the magnitude of stupidity here.... I am just going to conclude here because it is absolutely not worth pointing out any further flaws in the movie. Bollywood directors seem to have no shame anymore!!!!!!!! 
 Please someone stop Ben Stiller from acting in ANY movie. Write the studios hell write your local congressman even. I've gotten more laughs going to a funeral then I have watching ANY Stiller flick. Jack Black tries to make something about a comedy about disappearing dog crap and Christopher Walken perhaps on of the greatest actors of his generation simply looks embarrassed to be there. Stiller is his unfunny self but now even with someone to bail him out proves that he is way overrated as a comic. It's no wonder why this movie tanked badly and was available of the dollar movie theaters after only a handful of weeks. I warn you and you must warn your friends Do not watch this flick it is just awful worst then Gothika (personally i'd never thought i'd say that) worst the Plan 9 Worst the Ishtar worst then The Golden Child. Please Hollywood quit allowing Ben Stiller in your movies he's not funny he's a god awful actor and he's bringing others down with him. The following film was ranked 1 because there are no negative scores allowed so while the board says one I'll give it a Zero. 
 An absolute steaming pile of cow dung. It's mind-blowing to me that this film was even made. Hip-Hop and old westerns just don't seem to mix. What target audience were these people thinking of when planning this trainwreck. Not only is the concept and plot a joke but the acting is atrocious and the fact that some decent actors were even in this nightmare of a film makes their entire careers a laughing stock. The chick from clueless should never be forgiven and she is stripped of any remaining dignity she had. After reading the first ten pages of dialogue she should have been asking which one of her friends was playing this sick joke. After some research I actually found a list of some other actors who passed on this film: Jada Pinkett-Smith Denzel Washington Brandy Monique Kim Kardasian Jenna Jameson Oprah and finally Marge Simpson. Simply put I would rather stare at a blank TV than watch this movie again. 
 This was probably the worst movie ever seriously. I could actually do better myself it wasn't even set up properly. It's like this movie had a $5 budget and left with change. Don't watch it. I didn't even get all the way through this movie had to turn it off. I've give this a 1/10 because it was hilarious how the producer of this movie wanted it to be a horror movie but actually turned into a really bad comedy. Basically a bunch of girls crashed into a car broke a headlight and the owner of that car went after them. The bit that i saw was a women with a gun telling a load of girls to take all their clothes off what the hell? it must be some kind of cheesy porn movie as well. 
 THE TOY BOX (1971) BOMB Sure I like looking at nude women. While I prefer hardcore porn flicks I'll take softcore exploitation grindhouse junk like this too under the right circumstances. Well these aren't the right circumstances. These aren't ANY circumstances. There's supposed to be a horrific subplot lurking in here somewhere but I'll be damned if I can untangle it. This is another of those amateurish steaming piles of badly made manure that bores you to tears rather than stimulates you despite all the simulated sex going on all over the place. Bah -- if I want to see good sex scenes I'll watch the real stuff. 
 Not that a film by Ulli Lommel filled me with hope but I must confess that ZODIAC KILLER managed to sink beneath my lowest expectations. There is a recent trend among young filmmakers of utilizing digital video for their early projects which is all well and good for giving these kids the opportunity to create work without spending all their money on expensive film stock. But many of these young filmmakers have also wised up to the notion of filtering the finished movie so that it appears qualitatively more like celluloid. The effect is never perfect but it helps. Unfiltered digital video really only works for the mockumentary style because it never looks like anything other than video. Therein lies the primary trouble with ZODIAC KILLER. Watching the movie feels like watching a daytime soap opera about a murderer. It does not feel like watching a movie. And what's even more unforgivable is that the Lommel is NOT a young filmmaker. He ought to know better. He ought to know that it's virtually impossible to generate horror (or even suspense!) on video. For the love of god this guy has been directing since the sixties! He may be the only director who has failed to improve over a forty year career in the business. And lucky us he wrote the script too! So you can expect convoluted actions that mean nothing unjustified behavior and at least one truly pretentious plot element that will leave you utterly unsatisfied. Please please miss this film. You'll thank me later. 
 First a little summary. This reporter named Torch is basically trying to get out the story of a zombie outbreak and finds the military & government censoring him. Nice message government censorship and all that but the way they DID the movie was well let me explain. This movie is beyond description. The idea that somebody holds it in higher regard than anything by George Romero is justification enough for the reviewer to be committed to a mental institution. The script is atrocious on its own like it was written by a sixth grader.As for special effects I understand that independent films have low budgets and some gore effects looked acceptable but if you want a scene with fire here's a tip: buy some nonflammable material have an extinguisher ready and get a fire going! Don't digitally add it in and make it look like an explosion from a Nintendo 64 game. The acting well let's put it this way. In my summer theater program a cold reading of the script is compared to this The Godfather. I won't even go into the inconsistencies. Find them yourself. What disturbed me the most though was when everything was finished after shooting and editing somebody might have said Okay this looks good. Let's release it. It sends a chill down my spine to even think about it to think somebody felt that this was good enough for DVD release. This isn't DVD quality. This isn't Sci-Fi channel quality. Hell this isn't even film school quality. If you were to submit this in for a project at a film school you would get an F. No not even an F more like an F-. I wouldn't be surprised if he would try to get you expelled. I felt used after I saw this thing. Blockbuster and the makers of this movie have my money right now and I'd prefer not to think of what they're doing with it. I have been the pawn of some elaborate nefarious scheme at legalized theft and it doesn't feel good to think that I walked right into it looking at the back cover with pleasant memories of 28 Days Later only to find a film Ed Wood would watch and say afterwards I didn't much care for this. This film is the single most terrible movie I have seen. I have not seen anything by Ed Wood but I have confidence this is worse. If you are looking for serious cinema so much as being within ten feet of it will probably give you a bad headache. If not I still recommend that you personally write the director and ask how he sleeps at night. However if you are the kind of person who get a laugh out of really bad stuff then I recommend you check this out. You won't be disappointed. 
 What a disgrace! I was checking this out hoping it would be an undiscovered James Garner gem and what a stinker it turned out to be! The production quality was fine but the plot was undeniably lame and I can honestly say that I am only a couple hours older and a lot dumber now. The movie really had no redeeming qualities and if this kind of stuff keeps coming out it will give Hallmark a bad name. For those of you who insist on knowing what it was about it's about nothing and in this case it's not a good thing. We are subjected to watching one old ornery woman who is one of the dumbest creatures ever to roam the earth who happens to be married to a real sweetheart who is probably the only person alive that could put up with her. She drags him through one mess after another gets him into one embarrassing situation after another and is proud of herself the whole time. Then the movie ends. What a relief that was! Not worth the time it would take to watch it so do yourself a favor and skip this one you'll be glad you did if you knew how bad this one really is. 
 If you can believe it *another* group of teens return to *another* lakeside cabin three years after *another* one of those fatal 'accidents' claimed one of their number. Low and behold a psycho wearing a patterned hockey mask (a cheap papery one at that) turns up to waste them one by one. This mechanical 'Friday the 13th' knock off gained slight notoriety as one of the first digitally-shot features but that's where the interesting facts end and all that remains is a predictable amateur production with sub-par performances and a recurring boom-mic intrusion. A last-second twist does little to lift the spirits and 'Memorial Day' is something best tossed in a lake and forgotten about. One for insane slasher collectors only. 
 I wonder who how and more importantly why the decision to call Richard Attenborough to direct the most singular sensation to hit Broadway in many many years? He's an Academy Award winning director. Yes he won for Ghandi you moron! Jeremy Irons is an Academy winning actor do you want to see him play Rocky Balboa? He has experience with musicals. Really? Oh what a lovely war have you forgotten? To answer your question yes! The film is a disappointment clear and simple. Not an ounce of the live energy survived the heavy handedness of the proceedings. Every character danced beautifully they were charming but their projection was theatrical. I felt nothing. But when I saw it on stage I felt everything. The film should have been cast with stars unknown newcomers but stars with compelling unforgettable faces even the most invisible of the group. Great actors who could dance beautifully. Well Michael Douglas was in it. True I forgot I'm absolutely wrong and you are absolutely right. Nothing like a Richard Attenborough Michael Douglas musical. 
 This is the second movie I saw for Horrorfest this past weekend The Gravedancers being the first. Gravedancers was better. I can only guess from watching this that the production must have been quite limited. I will admit the story started out interesting but really fizzled for me in the end. We weren't really given time to sympathize or understand any of the characters which only made each of their erratic characteristics even more annoying. I have to mention that there was also a bit of mis-casting with a 12-year-old boy acting as Sheriff. The only reason I sat through the whole film was to find out what the big secret was which turned out to not be all that interesting. Some more background about the family would have helped but they didn't really seem like a family at all to begin with. To me this film is so amateur that I couldn't even see putting it on DVD. The four rating is for the initial potential the story might have had. This was one to skip for horrorfest. 
 Okay 'enjoy' is a pretty relative term but flexibility is in order when you're dealing with a filmmaker of James Glickenhaus' calibre. McBain is truly one of the most ridiculous over the top action films I've ever seen without the nasty edge of The Exterminator. Other reviews have commented on a suspension of disbelief regarding the film's heroic middle aged commandos but how about making a film in the Philippines that is set in Colombia? All the extras are Filipino. In fact the only character who looks remotely Hispanic is good ol' Victor Argo as the much reviled 'El Presidente'! Oh yes we also have Maria Conchita Alonso overemoting like crazy as a rebel leader. There are tons of explosions and bodies flying everywhere in this amusing paean to the glories of American imperialism. 
 This movie had the potential to be really good considering some of the plot elements are borrowed from the sci-fi actioner THE HIDDEN. And Dolph always lends some cheesy appeal to his roles. But someone somewhere really dropped the ball on this one. Dolph plays a butt-kicking monk (!) who travels to New York to retrieve a key that unlocks a door beneath his monastery that has imprisoned the antichrist for 2000 years. He must battle the minion who is a spirit that jumps from body to body much like THE HIDDEN and JASON GOES TO HELL. The minion naturally wants the key so it can let the antichrist out. Along for the ride is an annoying female archaeologist and together she and Dolph are chased by the minion-possessed bodies. If I'm making this sound entertaining forget it. The pacing is very awkward and sluggish the acting subpar at best and the fight scenes staged poorly. Dolph sleepwalks through his role and spouts some of the worst dialogue of his career. The cheese factor really picks up at the end when the minion battles an army of machine-gun wielding monks at the monastery but the rest of this flick is a snoozefest. Too bad I really wanted to like this. 
 This is only the second time I stopped a video/DVD part way through. I was willing to give this film the benefit of the doubt at first even though it managed to be both shallow clichd and stupid.. AND joyless plodding and pretentious. It was like an After School Special directed by that weird grade nine kid who thinks nobody understands him... creepy and sad with voice-over narration that only the most deluded adolescent would consider poetry... and some singing and... no really the poor child's suffering... Enough already especially when it morphed into a brazen clumsy and insulting Clockwork Orange ripoff. And did I mention the singing? This isn't the worst film I've ever seen but certainly the one I've felt least compelled to sit through. I don't recommend it to anyone. 
 This movie is a lot like the movie Hostel except with *BAD* acting and not much suspense. The gore elements are there but you don't really feel anything for the characters making the violence not very effective. Some parts are just strange... like forcing a snake down someones throat. What's up with that? Is that supposed to be scary or gory? It's just kind of stupid. As for torture there really isn't any (except for the guy getting blow-torched in the beginning which they don't show anyway). The main bad guy keeps saying make them die slowly yet the butcher kills them all very fast. The deaths are all relatively quick. Yes I did watch the unrated version. So overall not the worst gore movie I've seen but not at all good either. You won't miss anything if you skip this one. 
 Clocking in at an interminable three hours and twenty minutes Salaam-e-Ishq is a pretty but superficial comic soap opera from India that regales us with six interwoven tales of romantic love (which is at least four tales too many in my estimation). Filmed like a cross between an MTV music video and a Super Bowl beer commercial the movie is a sprawling mishmash of exotic settings dazzling colors sexy showgirls high-stepping song-and-dance numbers dream and fantasy sequences winking character asides corny dialogue and way-over-the-top comical performances - all pretty much standard-issue stuff when it comes to Bollywood happenings these days. It's an exhausting chore just trying to keep all the characters straight as they dance prance and preen their way through the incomprehensible storyline. There's plenty for the viewer to feast his eyes on here - not least of all all the drop dead gorgeous women - but he'll need the patience of Job to get him all the way through it. 
 Oh my God what the hell happened here?!! I'm not going to say this again but what sort of backward movie is this? The dubbing in this is way worst than the dubbing in King Kong vs Godzilla Linda Miller had to be the worst actress in it and the suits are really cheesy.Its about some villain called Dr.Who who gets henchmen to build a robot gorilla that has the same strength as King Kong but when this robot breaks down he builds another one and then tries to kidnap Kong.When he does(thats when Linda Miller gets annoying)he makes Kong his slave but everything goes wrong and King Kong escapes.Then Dr.Who sends the robot after him. Later when I was watching the movie I got a headache when Linda Miller and the other clowns started moaning.As I sat through the misery of watching the DVD while it was playing I was hoping that the madness in the movie was going to end until the fight.The ending has to be a really bad one because they could've shown Kong back on his island fighting dinosaurs again. Don't watch the movie under any circumstances or if you do... beware of the disappointment you will receive. 
 This movie shows how racist John Singleton is. He portrays whites and other races that are not black as the evil that exists in our educational system. How quick he forgets that it is this same educational system that made him what he is and failed at it. Ice Cube's character is the epitome of an instigating black man that was responsible for most of the violence in this film. Singleton barely touched on the relationships between the white and black characters that were trying to reach out to each other. When Omar Epps says I need to be with my people that racist remark spoke volume. And John don't think for a minute that the picture of Thomas Jefferson in the tower stairwell did not get my attention. Nice touch! 
 This so-called prequel is just a badly made remake to to a better version of Dangerous Liasons. The plots are identical as is most of the script. I loved the book its based off of and I loved the first movie but I'm not even going to bother with the 3rd movie. The pointless banter between the two main characters in the prequel was completely predictable and unoriginal and...I just can't stress how bad the movie was. If you don't want to take my word for it just watch it and you'll see what I mean. If you've read a review that says that 'If you likes the first one you'll like the second one' the only reason that is is because IT IS THE EXACT SAME MOVIE! Although the plot is not even as good. They took so many lines from the first movie Its hard to tell which movie you're watching. 
 A charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town cats and death soon follow them. That about sums it up. I'll admit that I am a little freaked out by cats after seeing this movie. But in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are wrong with this film and believe me there is plenty of that to go around it is overall a very enjoyable viewing experience. The characters are more like caricatures here with only their basis instincts to rely on. Fear greed pride lust or anger seems to be all that motivate these people. Although it can be argued that that seeming failing in actuality serves the telling of the story. The supernatural premise and the fact that it is a Stephen King screenplay(not that I have anything specific against Mr. King) are quite nicely supported by some interesting FX work makeup and quite suitable music. The absolute gem of this film is without a doubt Alice Krige who plays Mary Brady the otherworldly mother. King manages to take a simple story of outsider or people who are a little different(okay - a lot in this case) trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan. 
 may contain spoilers!!!! so i watched this movie last night on LMN (Lifetime Movie Network) which is NOT known for showing quality movies. THIS MOVIE IS AWFUL! i am still amazed that i watched the entire thing as it was terrible. could this movie contain any more stereotypes? (harping jewish mother who wants son to be a doctor catholic family with priest sons big big crucifixes in every room shown in the catholic family's house mexican whores bad guy who is really a softie at heart incredibly bad country accents) GAG!!!! i was at first intrigued by the fact that i had never heard of this movie and after seeing that cheryl pollack and corin nemec were in it i decided to stay awake until 4am to watch it. anyway the only redeeming thing about this movie is madchen amick's beauty. i suppose pollack's and nemec's acting is okay but they have a horrid script to work with. unlike the other reviewer who commented on the lack of texan accents (the movie is supposed to take place in austin and very few people there have a twang) i think that the accents were there (in supporting characters like mary margaret's date and john) and were unnecessary. they were also very very bad. i am so very tired of hollywood southern accents that sound nothing like the area where the accent is supposed to be from. and since it was supposed to take place in austin and shooting movies there in 1991 would not have been expensive i fully expected there to be familiar shots of the town: the beautiful capitol building the UT tower lit up for a winning football game etc. none of these things were there. also it takes about 5-6 hours to drive to mexico from austin. at one point in the movie michael and his posse take off for mexico to lose their virginities and are able to drive off when it is dark (during the summer and early fall it doesn't get dark in austin until 9pm or so) spend time in mexico getting drunk and having sex with mexican (is there any other kind?) whores and then return to austin by dawn. while this is theoretically possible it is NOT very likely. and if anyone has started school in the hill country (usually the third week of august but may have been in september in 1960) they know that unless they want to pass out from heat stroke they DO NOT wear their letter jackets!!!!! in august and september in austin and the surrounding areas it is 90+ degrees. only people with no body temperature would be stupid enough to wear sweaters or letter jackets on the first day of school. all in all a very bad made for tv movie experience. 
 Bathebo you big dope. This is the WORST piece of crap I've seen in a long time. I have just stumbled onto it on late night TV and it is painful to watch. Really painful. How does something like this get made?? Horrible horrible horrible! OOOOOO ..... The toilet is flushing by itself again! Scary toilet! Scary toilet! Scary toilet! 1992 doesn't seem like that long ago to me but watching this makes it seem like 1952. I mean its horrible. Please don't waste your time on the drivel! Scary old black man telling them not to build the pool in the yard. Scary! Scary! How does this stuff get MADE??? 
 The reason the DVD releases of this film are in black and white is because nobody can get their hands on a color print of this public domain film a modest sea story at best. Distributed for television thru Allied Artists DVD's (or VHS) on the market at this time for this title are all coming from the same 16MM television print. Films distributed for television prior to 1963 were often distributed in b/w prints because the bulk of viewers did not have color sets anyway. Striking b/w prints for television was also cheaper as it often involved quite a few prints to cover all stations running a film on a syndicated basis. 
 I have recently watched this movie twice and I can't seem to understand why the h*ll the makers made this pile of crap. I mean yes It gives a great impression of Hitler's environment and I mean the way they reproduced Austria in the late 1890's WWI and the Inter-war period. What I can't understand is why they pictured Hitler as a 100% pure evil mad unreliable mentally unstable freak. He was after all a very thoughtful loving and intelligent man who of course had his dark sides no doubt about that. But why in heaven's name portray him in this way? All of his positive aspects have been cut out of the scenario leaving nothing but a very propaganda-like portrait of a man who had the biggest influence on modern civilization ever. Yes he threw Germany into the devastating 2nd World War. Yes he was racist and yes he was at times menially unstable especially at the end of the war. All true. But again; why the hell did they plain LIE to the public? To warn us? I absolutely don't think this movie was a warning. The true danger of Hitler and the Nazi's was the fact they were able to rise to power at moments of severe global weakness. The fact this evil was so recognizable yet so embraced by almost every German alive (not to mention Austrians and a LOT of other people) makes it a warning to modern civilization NOT the fact Hitler was such a 'weirdo'. If it would have been like the makers make us believe - I would have been convinced that the German people were retarded. A man like the one in this movie would have never gotten anywhere near party leader - not to mention ReichsKanzler. 4/10 
 The Radar Men from the Moon is a pretty typical fare of 1950's serials. The special effects are pretty cheap the lunar rovers are obviously World War II surplus jeeps with painted plywood over them and the like. The acting is only so-so. It does inspire the imagination of children to whom I believe this was directed to. By today's standards it's boring cheap and bad. There's also a hefty amount of stock footage in the first 9 episodes of natural disasters. 
 Note to Horror fans: The only horror here is when you realized you just wasted 95 minutes of your life on a movie that's so worthless it's insulting. I watched this because: The premise sounded slightly promising: It's not. It's just an excuse to use the same lame set pieces from other low-budget slasher films that weren't good either. The promise of naked forest nymphs sounded nice even if the movie turned out to be awful: It's not. It's SO not. The amateur cinematography makes sure the fallen angels are about as sexy as the average homeless person. The name Tom Savini has a long history in the horror genre: He's the king of low-budget special effects and lower-budget acting. Come to think of it Savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie. It's not that he's bad but he's almost always in bad movies. His only good role was in From Dusk Till Dawn and he's been milking that at horror conventions ever since. But let's focus on the positive: Forest of the Damned is a great example of how NOT to make a movie. Everything else is a negative. Obviously the writer is allergic to originality. The script is terrible. That's all a given after the first 10 minutes. But the clueless pacing; the way the director treats plot and characterization as a nuisance he thinks no one cares about anyway; and the excruciatingly long and boring driving walking and nature sequences (no doubt added to increase the running time to make the film qualify for distribution) show a complete lack of aptitude for film and storytelling in general. This is another good example of the number-one way you can tell if a movie is going to be bad: If it's written and directed by the same person expect garbage. 
 When i looked at this years Wrestlemania's match card i was SO stoked and unable to control myself because i was full of excitement. It starts...and it ends. I'm sitting there angry to hell because of how much i wanted my money back. I mean you watch Wrestlemania 22 (one of my favorites) which will go down as a classic and then you expect the same and get the average garbage they have every now and then. The one moment in the entire show that ruined it for me was when HBK tapped out!!!! That very moment of HBK losing to JOHN CENA!!!!!!!!!! John Cena is such a loser/poser. It almost ruined Wrestlemania 22 for me when he beat TRIPLE H! I couldn't watch WWE after seeing Wrestlemania 23. I'm starting to watch it again (luckily). I again have faith in WWE after Wrestlemania 24 (the greatest i have ever seen) which was a pure classic Wrestlemania. It definitely made up for 'Mania 23 and gave us lots of memorable moments as well. If you have watched ANY of the Wrestlemanias before this one like the ones that turn you into fans (Wrestlemania 20 turned me into a fan) PLEASE don't watch this and make the same mistake i made and leave WWE behind. And if you DO watch it and are angry start watching it again and watch Wrestlemania 24 it is absolutely classic. 
 Reviewing KAZAAM and saying it's a bad movie isn't hard at all--after all critics at the time it came out fell all over themselves excoriating this film--saying it was among the worst films of the decade! So the fact that I say it's bad or anyone else says it's bad is certainly no surprise. It's like someone talking about WWII--practically no one says that was a GOOD thing right?! The question I have and no place on IMDb can answer it is why did they make this in the first place?! . After all it's obvious to anyone who isn't severely brain injured that the film would be horrible. But movies like ED (a baseball playing chimp) COOL AS ICE (starring the ever-popular Vanilla Ice) TROLL 2 (which doesn't even have any trolls in it) BABY GENIUSES (Einstain-like superhero babies) and PINOCCHIO IN OUTER SPACE (huh!?!) prove that any idea no matter how dumb can make it to the big screen! So the idea of the best basketball player of the time starring as a genie to an obnoxious little brat seems downright 'normal'! The film starts with a kid who is pretty jerky keying the lockers in the hallway of the school. Like the punk from FREE WILLY this kid is somehow 'misunderstood' (in other words a total brat) and you know that no matter how selfish and horrible he is by the end of the film he'll have learned something and grown. Just once I want to see a punk kid like this end up in prison or or dead by the end of the film! Eventually while the neighborhood bullies are in the middle of pummeling him the genie Kazaam (Shaquille O'Neal)is accidentally released and insists on giving the brat three wishes. But the kid doesn't believe him AND the genie's magic seems a tad rusty. Eventually the brat does realize that Kazaam is for real. However unlike most kids he withholds making his wishes so in the meantime Kazaam is forced to follow him around everywhere--like his own personal servant. And according to the clich you know that by the end of the film Max and Kazaam will have become lifelong buddies and a bunch of tears will be shed. Oh and Max will have come to terms with his absent father and mom's fianc (I'm gonna gag). Apparently this genie is a bit of a social worker in addition to being a granter of wishes. As for Kazaam Shaquille speaks in rhyme through much of the movie and even takes a break to rap...very poorly. I'm a middle-aged white guy and I think I could probably rap at least as well! He's an amazing basketball player and I've heard he's a nice guy--but a rapper...no way! As far as his acting goes he wasn't great but had such a nice personality in the film that it's hard to hate him--even if they made him do a lot of very stupid things. So is the movie as excruciatingly awful as you've probably heard? through the first two-thirds of the movie I would have said no. Shaquille seemed to try his best with an unlikable kid and a bad script. However later in the film the bad becomes horrid--as Kazaam seems too concerned with himself to help the kid when he's really needed. And out of nowhere the plot gets really really weird--as the guy who wants to make Kazaam a rap star(?!?!) turns out to be an evil mobster! And oddly this guy seems to accept that Kazaam is a genie with no hesitation! In addition the last portion of the film consists of people trying to kill Max and his dad. I know that the kid was annoying but this is supposed to be a kids' film!! What part of 'trying to kill the kid' didn't the writers not understand?!? Then in an ending that makes this perhaps the worst kids film ending in history Kazaam becomes god or something and it all was like a drug-induced hallucination! This ending was even dumber and weirder than the one in THE BLACK HOLE...and boy did it make my brain hurt!! Uggghh--the horrible dialog was just too much to bear!!! Overall it's a terrible film that is due mostly to writers who were certifiably insane. Yes folks with a messed up message bizarre non-kid friendly material and horrible characters this is one wretched film. Sadly given the idea and actors it's hard to imagine the final product turning out much worse!! By the way if you want to see a Genie in a modern world film that is GOOD try the British made for TV film Bernard and the Genie --a charming and exceptionally well-written film from start to finish. 
 This film is exactly what you get when you really over stretch your abilities it's like someone who has just passed there driving test and then pitting them in a formula 1 Grand Prix (not I might add the US Grand Prix as everyone might pull out due to dodgy tyres and you might just win) that is how far short this film falls. Now don't take this the wrong way I love B-Movies around half my collection is made of B-Movies but I don't think there are enough letters in the alphabet to describe how bad this film is. First of the story (for a B-Movie) isn't that bad it has potential there to make a B-Movie brand were not talking Friday 13th potential but potential none the less. But what really lets this film down is the acting at not one second do I believe anything it's like watching QVC except the presenters on QVC tend to have a heavier tan. In summary I'd like to say I've seen worse films but I can't. 
 The coming attractions to The Order make it seem like a decent horror mystery/thriller but what we get is a plot that has potential to be excellent all thrown together to form a pile of garbage. First off the whole movie consists of terrible dialogue and god awful special affects. The acting was also nothing to be proud of but Keath Ledger (I think I spelled that right.) saved the movie in this category. For heaven's sake: DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE! 
 Despite its flaws I enjoyed Cigarette Burns John Carpenter's Season One episode in the Masters of Horror series. Yes the story seemed like a cheap cross between IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS and 8MM but it was still quite good for the budget and time constraints given to it. With Pro-Life however the low budget and time constraints definitely show more than anything else. There is solid directing as always from Carpenter yet there is a quality to the writing and whole production itself that gives the feeling it was made in a total and complete rush. The script isn't always clear the message fuzzy and the story is full of plot holes once you look back on them. Maybe had Carpenter re-written the script it could have been a worthwhile episode. Instead it's a mess that only hardcore Carpenter fans will find the slightest enjoyment in. Definitely the worst Carpenter has ever done. 2/10 
 Harsh yes but I call 'em like I see 'em. I saw this in the late 80's and it was truly one of the most awful boring films I've ever forced myself to watch. Yes the cinematography is lovely. The Czech settings are truly stunning. The political backdrop is enticing but unlike similar historically set stories (e.g. _Dr. Zhivago_ (qv)) this one failed to make the politics relevant to the story or even interesting. Sure Olin and Binoche are beautiful. But this film manages to make even erotic scenes plodding and slow. I'm all for romance but this movie was so boring I started hoping the Russians would shoot them all and put an end to my misery. I'm sure if I'd read the book the story would have made a bit more sense. However life's too short to expend any more time on this one. 
 I'm a nice guy and I like to think of myself as genre-tolerant. And I guess by that I mean I try to consider a movie in the context of the genre that it resides in. If nothing else that saves me from feeling like I should be saying really nasty things about people or films which I don't like doing. The plot in this one was patently obvious the production values very low and sets uhm simplistic. The acting rose into good for a high school play territory from time to time. My feeling was this was filmed in a day -- please tell me it was. Worst of all the sex while reasonably plentiful was fairly mundane hampered by at least in my copy a sound-over that was inconsistent with the action (climatic moans and shrieks while lying on a bed undoing a bra???). There was definitely no edge to it at all--nothing distinguishing or interesting and with surprisingly quick cuts. My vote is a 1 then with the following summary statement: would have been better if the filler stripper material at the club was expanded and the rest of the movie condensed. 
 When I'd seen the name of this movie I'd always thought it was a musical. Like The Harvey Girls. It's not. It's a pudding that overcooked hit the kitchen ceiling and was pried off and cobbled together. No music and not a period piece but thoroughly improbable. It starts with patriarch James Woods telling the eldest of his three daughters a small child who grows to be Barbara Stanwyck that she must maintain the family name and home. We thus think it is going to be a historical intergenerational tale. And it is for a brief time. Then it turns into the story of cold-hearted Stanwyck's fight against lawyer George Brent. Why is she so dead set against him? Well why else? As we learn in a strange flashback sequence narrated by Stanwyck she had once thought she could inherit some money (for her sisters as well as herself of course) by marrying. She hit on someone she took to be a country bumpkin who was in fact budding lawyer Brent. Lest anyone think the child they had a young man of eight or so at the time of the main plot is -- well you know ... They had a hasty marriage and during the very short time they were together he was conceived. One of her sisters is in love with a painter named Gig Young who is played by Gig Young. The other sister tries to take him away. Etc. etc. It is a shrill unengaging mess -- well enough acted but without a shred of logic or plausibility. 
 This movie had to be the worst horror movie I have ever seen. The acting was terrible Horrible and cheesy and talk about a predictable plot! I will never watch this movie again nor will I recommend this movie to anyone. What a waste of time! First as soon as the movie began I realized what I got myself into. All they did for this movie was copy scenes from many other horror movies out there and bunched them all into this one movie. The prank phone calls halloween night a psycho and one knife! Its absolutely ridiculous. I was not scared at all during the movie which I thought horror movies were supposed to do. As for the making of the movie its pretty hilarious how they all talk about how this movie was so great and so scary. I mean how do you not realize that the movies is a cheap rip off of Scary Movie for example. At least get some good actors in there and then maybe it would have been pulled off as a good horror movie. 
 Painful to watch and not entirely for empathy with the struggles of the characters. Two of the main characters Cynthia the mother and Monica the acknowledged daughter spend the great bulk of the film pathetically mewling and bitterly bitching respectively. Their characters are so firmly established that their redemption into tolerable personalities after a quick family catharsis is unbelievable. It wasn't worth the wait. I wish a worthy pitch for honesty among families was less of a headache to view. 
 Although the beginning suggests All Quiet on the Western Front this silly and superficial version of war falls far astray of its much better contemporary. This depicts the funnest war ever fought with the first hour and a half devoted to romance and good times. When we finally see some battle it is lame: An enemy plane flies over? Shoot it down (in one shot). Sniper in the tree? Kill him before he gets a shot off. Enemy soldiers in the woods? Not to worry they gladly surrender. Ho-hum. Tepid turgid predictable... 
 After hearing raves about this movie for years I finally decided to rent it and watch. Let me start by saying that I'm glad that the rental was free from the local library. This move was slow boring unrealistic and the plot made no sense. After 2 hours I was ready to nuke that backwater Texas town and put the group of those characters out of their misery. I realize that taste is subjective but believe me I just do not understand all of the hype that I have heard about this movie. Dallas provided as good a detail of the life in Texas as this movie. Rent it only if you want to understand how movie studios can pay enough money to reviewers to convince the general public that a bad movie is good. 
 When you look at this now and hear all the language in here it's amazing this was rated PG but that's the 1970s rating system for you. Peter Falk spews out the Lord's name in vain six times in the first ten minutes alone in this movie! Yet few people consider that offensive and certainly not the scumbags who make movies nor the people who rate them. The cast is a clue to how profane this film can be: Falk Peter Boyle Allen Garfield Warren Oates Gena Rowlands and Paul Sorvino aren't exactly actors you wouldn't find in The Sound Of Music. I like heist movies and a lot of films by director William Friedkin but this script doesn't deliver and it just has way too much of the Sleazy '70s feel to it visually and audibly. For those who loved Falk in TV's Columbo it must come as a shock to hear him use as much profanity as he did in films. This is far from the only case. 
 Look I'm reading and reading this comments and there's a lot of it that I wanna say but I will try to make it short but clean... First of all lets forget all of the things how bad this movie was made...How it didn't show anything of Notorious and I agree with the most people here saying that it was Hollywood I mean what did you expect a real life story? When will people wake up and see that u will never ever find the real truth about 2pac and Biggie... Its all covered up and buried deep down. Second I'm not against neither 2pac or Biggie I love them both but 2pac and Lil Kim DID get embarrassed in this movie for sure... Next for all of ya that are saying that the movie is awesome and cant see the truth either u are too blind too see it because u think u know something about BIG or you don't know anything about him at all and u love this Hollywood teenage movies. Use your mind and see though the clouds... There is a lot of it you could say when it gets to this topic I did not say 60% of what I have to say because its a very wide topic but for the movie I can only say that it could have been a little bit I mean a much better done. But anyways I'm just some person giving her opinion....No hard feelings... Look I love hip hop and I live for it but after seeing this movie every person with a little intelligence could see that this is not how someone is suppose to live. With all do respect for 2pac and BIG like all the other artists who are making for a living like this should turn the other page because u are ruining the youth....Bringing the wrong message to the children and that is: not going to school but living from the streets hustling and just grabbing for the paper.... The true hip hop is suppose to be about love and intelligence be smart and all. OK I know that many of you will think that I'm crazy but this is just my point of view. Look I am maybe wrong about something and Im not saying this is a completely bad movie because even if I'm in hip hop for 17 18 years I still don't know anything bout 2pac or Biggie no matter how many articles I read or how much I support them and listen to their music...Like most of you all out there. Only people who were really close to them and the killers know the truth behind all this. And for the end I just wanna say for all of ya Biggie and Tupac fans and family this two men were and will be the greatest of all time no matter how they lived their lives but PLEASE IN THE FUTURE TRY TO BE BETTER LEARN AND LOVE EACH OTHER THINK GOOD EVEN FOR THE ONES THAT Don't LIKE YOU BECAUSE AT THE END...ITS NOT ABOUT HOW MANY MONEY OR FAME U COULD GET AND HOW FAST U COULD GET TO THE TOP ITS ABOUT ACCOMPLISHING YOUR SELF TO THE FULLEST AND FEEDING YOUR SOUL YOUR BODY AND MIND...BECAUSE IF U MANAGE TO DO THAT YOU WILL BE LIVING A LIFE EVEN AFTER DEATH!!!! PEACE AND LOVE TO YA ALL!!!! RIP BIGGIE 2PAC AALIYAH LEFT EYE JAM MASTER JAY AND THE OTHERS WHO MAKE A CHANGE IN THIS WORLD!!!! 
 The film released at the start of 2000 alongwith MELA both disasters So sad to start a millennium with such nonsense The film seems to suit 70's but looks like an unintentional comedy for 2000 Anywayz some classic gems from the film: Paresh Rawal I don't understand to laugh at his role or cry Reason: He goes searching his mother in the village worst part is when he realises a secret of Anil he keeps the secret in his stomach which becomes big and makes him look pregnant I remember in my childhood my teacher told me the same joke Urrf!!!! as a child i laughed at it that time but here? The whole film is a joke can't explain We have Anil in a dual role(One older and younger) and Rekha playing the older's wife and Raveena the youngers We also have reject Harish while Shakti playing the son of Aruna Irani who both fight on who has the worst wig Direction is outdated Music is bad Anil tries hard looks too old in the younger role and too young in the older role yet good effort Rekha is adequate Raveena too is okay Harish is bad Shakti Kapoor is terrible Aruna Irani is as usual Rajnikant is okay in a cameo 
 Do not see this movie if you value your mind. At the end of our collective viewing me and my friends estimated that we each lost 5% of our brains during its course. The only person involved with its making that was not clinically insane was the set designer. Most movies leave a bad taste in your mouth. I realize now that instead of a feeling of revulsion this movie has bred a deep hatred within me. I hate this movie so very very much. Some might say this movie is not meant to be taken seriously. If only it didn't take itself seriously. But it does. The plot is a warmed over version of Blade Runner-esque universe melded with the cheap rubber suits so prevalent in bad dinosaur movies. The dialogue is not only puerile and meaningless but often literally painful. Whoopee Goldberg isn't even trying but George Newbern as the voice of Theodore Rex is like fingernails on the soul. And whether its Juliet Landua with her off again on again British accent or Richard Roundtree (aka Shaft) as the blustering Commissioner you will sink into an ever increasing sense of incredulity and disillusionment. I recommend this movie only to anyone who wishes to see the depths of stupidity to which mankind may fall. 
 When thinking about Captivity many words come to mind. Among them are: uninteresting unentertaining unsuspensful unsexy unfathomable and unwatchable. I used to hate those movies from the mid to late nineties that were basically ripoffs of Scream but these new Saw knockoffs are beginning to make those films look like classics. They still pander to the same demographic that those other movies were so successful at doing but now they add a new level of degeneracy that make the twelve to fourteen year old girls they're aimed at feel like they're hardcore AND hip. This movie is a load of boring crap! What the hell has happened to Larry Cohen? His name hasn't been attached to anything good since 1993! Even so I was still surprised to see that he had anything to do with something THIS bad! Was anyone surprised when the movie's love interest turned out to be one of the psychopaths? Did anyone not know it when they first saw him? Only someone who has never before in his or her life ever seen another movie! 
 I'm sorry to say that there isn't really any way in my opinion that an Enzo would really be able to keep up with a Saleen S7 Twin Turbo. The power to weight advantage possessed by the S7 would just be too great. The S7 has a power:weight ratio of 3.93 lbs/hp while the Enzo has 4.61 lbs/hp. The S7s low end is much better too. Sorry Ferrari fans but the Saleen just gets it done so much better. As for other parts of this film I just have to say it's so substandard as to be pathetic. The story is way too weak. The acting in this lemon is worse than daytime soaps. I can say that as far as it being a treatise on negative psychology its kind of a gem. This film is nothing if not a glaring definition as to what narcissism and sociopathy are all about. Its all about these rich punks getting their rocks off while showing only traces of feigned remorse for all the innocent road users they cause injury or death too. I can't give the film a 1 Star rating because it didn't compel me to actually walk out of the theater. I also think that having an amazingly beautiful brunette with killer blue eyes as the leading female saves it from being completely abysmal....although there is no way her singing would put her on the cover of 'Variety'. ps: the guy who plays Jason is SOOOOO the skid row version of James Vanderbeek. 
 The late 80's saw an inexplicable rash of supernatural horror films set in gloomy penitentiary settings. Renny Harlin's superbly gritty and moody Prison got the whole haunted hoosegow ball rolling; it was immediately followed by the markedly inferior The Chair John Saxon's enjoyably trashy Death House the passable psycho picture Destroyer and this hideously limp'n'lethargic exercise in hopelessly comatose tedium. Your usual annoying collection of horribly unsympathetic college student chowderheads lead by insufferably spineless tormented twerp Alex (the hugely unappealing Nicholas Celozzi) go to Alcatraz Island to investigate the bizarre circumstances surrounding the sudden gruesome death of up-and-coming rock star Sammy Mitchell (blandly played by Toni Basil of Hey Micky fame). Alex's brother becomes possessed by the evil demonic spirit of a vicious cannibalistic US Civil War cavalry commandant and goes on the expected killing spree thus forcing wimpy Alex to overcome his passivity and make a stand against this ghoulish specter. Although slickly photographed by Nicholas Von Sternberg with a few decent gore set pieces and a fair amount of spooky atmosphere (the film was shot on location in the dismal rusty rundown ruins of Alcatraz Island) Slaughterhouse rock nonetheless just doesn't cut it as a solid effective fright feature. This is largely due to the uniformly obnoxious and unlikeable collegiate smartaleck characters a tiresomely smirky bunch whose inane comic antics prove to be grating rather than amusing. The flat acting from a noticeably disinterested cast hurts matters all the more with onetime Playboy playmate and undeniable blonde cutie pie hottie supreme Hope Marie Carlton doing an especially irritating Linnea Quigley impersonation as the token oversexed nympho bimbo. Dimitri Logothetis' direction displays a modicum of flashy visual style but the tone is unevenly pitched between grim seriousness and goofy horrendously sophomoric silliness and most damagingly Ted Landon's sloppy inconsistent overly complicated and finally quite confusing script miserably fails to develop the necessary internal logic to make the far-fetched story even remotely plausible. In other words this stinker sadly succeeds in making a scant 90 minutes seem like an excruciatingly drawn-out cinematic jail sentence. 
 A killer cannibal rapist is killed by a crazed cop on the scene of his latest murder. At his grave a cult have gathered with plans to resurrect him by peeing onto the grave. This of course works and he awakes ripping the guys penis off and he is back into his old killing ways with an all new zombie look. The two cops one of who is going a little crazy about the scum of the city and has a drug problem are back on the case. Two of the original cult member also tries to stop the killer by resurrecting some other kind of dead thing. Thinking they have filed they leave but out from the grave comes a plastic baby doll that was used in the original resurrection. Sounds a bit confusing really but no its just rubbish. The acting is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy that plays Dr Vincent van Gore in the faces of gore series and he is just as terrible as the annoying cop in this film. The other cop just about struggles to get his terrible lines out. Now I'm all for low budget cinema but this film is just terrible. If it wasn't for the very easy on the eye ladies and their nakedness I would probably have fallen asleep. There is a bit of gore but it's never more than some animal guts placed on the stomach of the victims. The zombie makeup on the other hand looks great and his foot long penis that he uses to rape his victims with is kind of funny at times. There is also a half decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll. The doll with the chipmunks voice is the stupidest thing I have ever seen in a film. It is just a plastic toy on a fishing line. The ending is extremely bad. You would expect the killer to put up much more of a fight than he does. God knows how they made enough money to make a sequel. 4/10 
 There are no reasons of taking this documentary serious and there are four reasons for that: 1) The people who made this documentary (including the director and the producer) are Serbs or of Serbian origin therefore the criteria of neutrality fails. For instance they mentioned that the diaspora Croats (the so called Ustase ) played a huge part in the fall of Yugoslavia but they didn't mention that there were equal Serbian organizations as well (Cetniks)! For you who aren't that familiar with Balkan WW2 history: The Serbian so called Cetniks that were portrayed in the documentary as being so kind that they helped British paratroops during the war. Well that's only half the truth. They were also a fascist (Monarch) group who collaborated with the Germans but then switched side when Hitler started losing the war. It's also ironic that they don't mention the Cetnik leader Mihajlovic in the documentary a man that is responsible for killing thousands of people and burning hundreds of villages all over Bosnia and Croatia. But they mentioned a certain Ante Pavelic...Hm...Allow me to be just a little suspicious. 2) Most of the people interviewed are to me totally unknown. And I've studied this war for a long time (who is the old British lady!!! She really hasn't made her homework!) and they are not even presented by name so they could More or less be anybody maybe someone they took from the street. Who knows. 3) In The documentary they talk about Kosovo and how the Serbs have lived there for ages and therefore it should belong to Serbia (even though they are a minority). Well when they mention the Serbian dominated part of Croatia (Krajina) suddenly the Serbs are portrayed as how they have the right to live there because it has been their home for so long. Fine but what people don't know is that the largest city in Krajina (Knin) has great historical importance for the Croatian people. It was there where one of the most celebrated Kings of Croatian history (Zvonimir) was crowned and therefore the city has a historical value for Croatia. The Serbs arrived almost 800 years or so later! But no the Serbs should have Krajina and Kosovo according to the documentary. Is that fair? To me it looks like double standards of morality from the director. Plus it is said in the documentary that the Croatian constitution didn't have any laws about minority rights this is a lie because it was one of the first laws implemented BECAUSE of the fact that Croatia had a huge Serbian minority. 4) The film mentions a radical Croatian Paramilitarian leader called Glavas. Or the Muslim radical Oric. They accused them of being a huge reason for the negative development of the war. Yes they were radicals but if you want to talk about radicals why not also mention the Serbian radical paramilitary leaders such as Seselj and Arkan? The flaws are so many that I just presented a few of them just so that people get an overview of the documentary. It looks like the people who made this documentary weren't well prepared and didn't have the guts to criticize the Serbs because they were afraid that their Serbian relatives would slap them or something. There aren't that many documentaries out there that are of good quality but the best so far is The death of Yugoslavia where all the significant participants of the war are interviewed (e.g. Milosevic Jovic Bulatovic Tudman Izetbegovic Karadzic etc.) and where you get a whole 5 hour explanation about the fall of Yugoslavia and the war. One other thing. I saw a comment on this documentary where the person was frustrated about why the US gave support to a country (Bosnia) that had connections with Bin Laden during the war. Well first of all all the countries involved in this conflict had nationalist presidents and because the Bosnian Muslims didn't have an old ethnic identity (previosly they were called Muslim Croats ) they had to rely on something else besides nationality to raise the spirit among the people and that was by connecting them to the only thing that they had in common: Their religion. And they took help from the Mujahedin because no one else would support them. They had to fight the 4:th largest army in Europe! They needed all the help they could get. Nationalism is the best way to unite a people during war. History has shown us that. 
 I'm still trying to figure out if there was a point to this film. For content that's supposed to be so 'rebellious' and 'controversial' the things that Maddox distributes to the students are awfully lame. Students seem to be easily swayed by vague anti-authoritarian sentiments and snippets of words illegibly scrawled onto leaflets. Rebel everybody. I suppose it would have been too much to ask to have a teenage rebellion film where a school fire alarm doesn't get set off. Apparently a 'huge fight up on the football fields' is a fight that consists of two people. Characters personalities seem to wildly vary at random. A football jock who Maddox was fighting (and who subsequently got a staple on the face) is all smiles and apologies the next day. The fact that it doesn't come to any real conclusion of the plot makes me feel that the whole thing could have been fitted into a half hour after school special. If they had cut most of the attempted pseudo-glitch soundtrack. 
 I think the biggest failing something can have is to be boring. Bad is actually better than boring. This thing has no breath. It does have the interesting fact of taking place in Cambodia. How many American made films of the 30's take place in Cambodia. Nevertheless the conflict there is a little hard to figure out. Even the troop movements are a little confusing. What drags it to a resounding halt is the love story. Why those two guys are so totally transfixed on the dippy blonde I don't know. I thought he should continue to use his Zombies (such as they are) and forget all about her. The movie just plods along. The perfect microcosm is where one of the principle characters follows a Cambodian priest through the water to get to the secret place where the hieroglyphics (or whatever) that explain how to turn people into zombies is kept. I thought they would never get there. One guy takes two steps. He stops. He looks around. The other guy hides behind some columns. He takes two steps. He stops. He looks around. The other guy hides behind some bushes. This is the movie in a nutshell. Then there is the bad acting and insipid dialogue. I actually have a lot of patience when it comes to B movies. This one is insufferable. By the way a more apt title would be Revolt of the Hypnotized. 
 Featured in 1955's THE COBWEB is an all star cast ranging from silent screen veteran LILLIAN GISH to Actors Studio progeny SUSAN STRASBERG. Set at an exclusive psychiatric hospital what is this movie about you wonder......high drama ? Doctor & patient relationships ? Shock therapy treatment ? No this howler is about who exactly will get to pick the draperies for a psychiatric hospital ! You think I'm kidding ? You won't believe your eyes as you're watching this unbelievable storyline that was turned into a movie ! Progressive head shrink Dr. McIver (RICHARD WIDMARK) wants to have all of the hospital's patients involved in the design selection and execution of the needed new draperies. McIver's wife played by marble mouthed GLORIA GRAHAM wants to get her 2 cents in on this monumental task too. So does long time staffer Miss Inch (LILLIAN GISH). Directed by VINCENT MINELLI you kinda wonder if he really became this overly involved in minute detail because of his marriage to worry wart JUDY GARLAND. Talented actors like LAUREN BACALL SUSAN STRASBERG CHARLES BOYER and JOHN KERR are wasted in this hokey story. What were they thinking ? 
 I was eager to see Mr. Fix It because I'm a huge David Boreanaz fan. What I got though was a 1-1/2 hour nap. The premise seemed enjoyable: Boreanaz is Lance Valenteen proprietor of a business called Mr. Fix It where dumped men enlist his help to get their girlfriends to take them back. Among the problems with this movie are the editing script and acting. Although I've found Boreanaz delightful in his other film roles (with the exception of that Crow movie he did) this was disappointing. At times his character was interesting and others flat. The supporting cast reminded me of soap opera day players. I realize it wasn't a big-budget film but some of the scene cuts and music just didn't seem right. My advice: watch at your own risk. 
 Well I like to be honest with all the audiences that I bought it because of Kira's sex scenes but unfortunately I did not see much of them. All sex scenes were short and done in haphazard manner along with all the weird and corny background music just like all other B movies - it just doesn't look much like two people having sex. There is a tiny bit of plot toward the end - Kira's new lover is a killer. Whoa!!! how shocking!!! Why don't we nominate this movie for Oscar Award? I can't imagine how bad the movie would look like if it were R-rated (Mine is imported from UK rated 18). Conclusion? Put it down and walk away so yon won't end up with being a moron like me. Score: 2/10 
 I remember watching this movie several times as a very young kid and there were parts of it (many in fact) that I did not understand. I think I have seen it once as an adult and I then understood those parts. The only problem with viewing it as an adult was that it was not entertaining to me at all. So what kind of movie is this? Is it a kids movie ? Not hardly. It contains language and subject matter not suitable for kids. Is it a hyperbole of what every parent feels like they are going through with their own children? Maybe but then why wouldn't it focus more on John Ritter's character instead of Junior? When a film has a 7-year-old as its main character in order to do well with it's audience it should be a movie for the seven and under crowd otherwise people older than that will have no way to relate (even 8-year-olds wouldn't want to see a movie about a kid who is whole year younger than them). I'm pretty sure this film did not do well in the box office and the reason has to be because it was unable to find a niche in the market. 
 Having lived in Japan for several years this movie does not reflect the Japanese culture and does not even come close to explain what being a Geisha is all about. Unfortunately a great opportunity has been missed to bring the Japanese culture a bit closer to the broad Western audience and help demystify the country where Zen Samurai the Geisha world of Kyoto originate from. Some of the most poignant moments of the movie are when the Americans are shown in Japanese surroundings.The Geisha dances were not authentic. There was far too much use of Chinese music. A minor but essential detail: proper use of the incense sticks was nowhere to be seen. The Sakura scenes were almost obscenely kitschy ! Interestingly some of the Chinese actors were quite convincing as Japanese persons. 
 Before I go on I have to admit to being a huge Bon Jovi fan. In fact thats what attracted me to the DVD case in the first place. I probably would have bought it anyway being such a big horror fan and having enjoyed the first Vampires title so much. But this isn't half as good. Not even Jon could save this film for me. My main problem would be that it simply isn't scary. Apart from Jon's character Derek Bliss none of the other characters make an impression and you couldn't care less whether they die or not especially the annoying vampire / drug addict woman. The female vampire simply isn't scary or sexy. Rather she looks like an anorexic 14 year girl no wonder she is so desperate for blood then. Another huge problem is that everything is just too bright . There is no atmosphere or sense of dread. I know the first Vampires being set in New Mexico wasn't exactly the twilight zone in terms of creepiness but yet it still managed to be dark and foreboding when it needed to be. This film has no tension like that. The story is basically the same as before. Vampire wants Berzier's cross to be able to walk in daylight. However the story has less cool bits this time. There is no wow factor in knowing this is the master of all master - the original vampire as in the first film. You really don't care who or what this one is. There is no army of masters. Instead she hides out in some old ruin which looks more like a Disneyland attraction then a creepy temple. So there you have it really. Lack of scares lack of atmosphere lack of interesting story. A real let down for me personally. 
 Nothing positive to say. Meandering nonsense huffing and puffing with a message . New Russian (post-Soviet) films can be very good (Cuckoo comes to mind) yet many have the bouquet of cardboard and the aftertaste of asbestos (Nochnoi Dozor would be a good example). This is a dozor type of emptiness. Acting would be horrible if not for the saving grace of utterly unappealing direction and incompetent editing that sometimes is so awful that it distracts from the impotence of the actors. Special award to the cameraman for making sure that every shot is shaky (would someone please realize that Blair Witch has had its 15 seconds of undeserved fame?) and takes are geared towards attention-deficit pre-teens who subside on CounterStrike and masturbation. The female lead poses and tries to look seductive too often male antihero need a diction coach (although genetics aren't bad: rather expressive eyes.) One (middle) finger for this irrelevant pile of non-art. Anyone who reviews this positively better be a (distant) cousin of the auteurs . 
 The plot certainly seemed interesting enough. How can a real-life brutal murder be turned into a truly boring movie? Well you can watch Wonderland and find out. I had heard of the Wonderland murders before this film was released and found it to be an interesting true story of some genuinely sadistic people. Unfortunately there is zero character development so we never get a chance to understand why any of this was done or get a good sense of the interrelationships between the characters. The pace of the direction was very tedious. This all leads to an extraordinarily boring movie. Given that Dawn Schiller - a central character as Holmes's girlfriend - was an associate producer and that Holmes's wife was a consultant on the film we should have had the opportunity to gain some real insight into the characters. 
 In the first 20 minutes every cliche possible was trotted out by the hack writer and director. There was the NTSB primary investigator with the tortured family life; the politically-tortured NTSB board member played by [I can kill ANY TV] Ted McGinley; the tortured father of a crash victim; and the torturing sleazy ambulance-chasing lawyer. Hollywood still has no concept of the fragility of aircraft. The crashed plane was a 737 and it was mostly sitting on the ground like a hippo who decided to take a nap. The first third of the fuselage was intact the rear half of the plane was intact and the debris field showed no wings or engines. Most of the people should have walked away in light of how many people survived that plane that got shredded in Iowa after it lost its hydraulics. Most of this TV plane wasn't even burned. It reminded me of the scene in Air Force One where the 747 hits the water and then skips along like it's made of inch-thick steel. The show was so bad it was impossible to watch. Even my wife who is more accepting than I was commenting on technical flaws. What had me stunned was how this POS could ever get made. Are the producers of these things so used to clichs that they can't even recognize them? Somebody read this script and said: Yes I want to spend a million bucks making this real. I wish I was the guy's next appointment. I have title to a wonderful bridge in New York that I'd sell cheap. 
 In 2005 George W. Bush started with his second period as a President of the United States; North Korea announced its possession of nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; and a movie called Into the Blue appeared.The existence of this movie is not as bad as the other things that happened on that year but the film itself was pathetic and maybe the worst one from that year.Now in 2009 the United States have another President there is another Pope new Korean nuclear weapons...and the film Into the Blue 2 : The Reef which is better than the original one...but that's the same as saying : getting your fingers cut is better than getting your head cut .This sequel is a really bad film which kept me tremendously bored and uninterested.The cast of Into the Blue 2 : The Reef is composed by TV-series actors who completely lack of any credibility and dramatic weight but who are perfect for showing their bodies.Chris Carmack (The O.C.) David Anders (Heroes and Alias) Laura Vandervoort (Smallville) Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) bring hollow and boring performances.I have liked some previous movies from director Stephen Herek (Critters and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure specially) but on this movie he cannot generate even the minimum level of tension emotion or entertainment.The characters from this movie are not only badly performed but they are also repulsive.Honestly I wanted all of them to die.The cinematography from this movie is also lame and it seems to have been made by a technical team who makes promotional videos for Hawaiian hotels.Into the Blue 2 : The Reef is a horrible movie which is better than the original film but that's the same as nothing as I previously said.Avoid this crappy film at all costs. 
 This movie has Richard Pryor Rosey Grier and others. It's a curious WW2 movie and serves as a statement about racism. It is worth watching to understand the fact that Movies reflect how we feel about the issues when they are produced and not about the period of time they portray. Meaning this is a 70's movie not a 40's movie (WW2). Still there is some good action scenes of 7 seven black men led by a white captain trying to capture a Dam. The story centers on the Captain learning that these men are soldiers and not just a service company. There is a scene that could be from a Civil War movie and not a WW2 movie that reflects what the movie is all about. The Black Lt. gives a German women a innocent peck on the cheek and the white Capt becomes upset. I enjoyed the movie from a curiosity stand point since the stars and the Genre were interesting to me. 
 Being S Club Seven the film already boosts an ecstatic atmosphere! But seriously Oprah has a point when claiming: Don't go there girl! Spice World suddenly doesn't seem to be all that bad... I take my money elsewhere! 
 This was a great book and the possibilities for a truly great film were definitely there. But the casting decisions completely wrecked the movie. Hanks is a great actor to be sure but lacks the smarmy morally ambivalent characteristics needed for the lead role. Jeff Daniels would have been my choice. Putting Melanie Griffiths in for eye candy reasons is understandable but again she did not portray the depth or ambivalence so need to pull this off. This movie is a great example of how every decision even those early on in the movie production can make or break a file. 
 I am a fan of the previous Best of the Best films. But this one was awful. No wonder I had such a hard time finding it. I tried 4 video rental stores until I found one with a copy of this movie. The acting was terrible the plot was a joke and the action was bad as well. I really miss Alex Grady Travis Brigley and the original kickboxing characters and theme that this film had with the first 2 movies. John 
 The only reason I didn't score this a one is that Sibrel does show that he is adept at the technical aspects of making a film. It is a technically adept film. That having been said this is a film based on lies and distortions that are quite easily disproven. Most of the documentary is spent using propaganda techniques to bash the space program rather than actual fact. And Sibrel's irrefutable proof that the landings were faked is easily refuted if you know anything about orbital mechanics. I do not recommend watching this but if you do see it at google video for free. Don't let Bart Sibrel profit from your curiosity. 
 Herbie the Volkswagen that thinks like a man is back now being driven by Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan) a young woman who hopes to become a NASCAR champion. The only thing standing in her way is the current champion Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon) who will do anything to stop them. The original love bug wasn't that good. Even as a kid I remember not liking it very much. I had some hope for the sequel though. I mean the cast is pretty good and the trailer makes it seem like a pretty fun movie. Unfortunately Herbie is no better now than he was before. The film is defiantly weak for people over the age of 12. It will probably entertain the kids but that's all. I realize it's a kids film and all but they could have made the film a little more interesting. There were very few laughs and it got boring near the end. Most of the actors seemed dead in their roles too. Lindsay Lohan was alright as Maggie Peyton. She usually gives better performances like in Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. Matt Dillon gave the best performance out of everyone. He was very good as the bad guy even though he didn't have a lot to work with. Justin Long Breckin Meyer and Michael Keaton are really just there and they don't do anything special. Angela Robinson directs and she does an okay job. She tries to keep the film interesting but she's working with a weak script. Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant wrote the screenplay and would it be any surprise to you that they were also responsible for Taxi and The Pacifier? These two make light films yet they fail to really make the stories interesting or enjoyable. It's not completely their fault but hopefully next time they will try harder. In the end Herbie is a safe predictable family film that's worth watching if you're a kid. Everyone else is better off skipping it. Rating 4/10 
 The original Vanishing Point was a great flick. Subtle motives characters that seemed real and spontaneous.The remake was terrible. Preachy overtly obvious; it missed the point as to why the original was a classic. The black Charger was cool but even that couldn't rescue this flick. Why stick with a white Challenger? I didn't think that was the best choice back in '71. Some parts of the film were unintentionally hilarious. Like when Vigo was standing on a cliff overlooking the canyon after his Dream Quest . His Indian pal was standing next to him. Vigo was only wearing his white briefs. I'm sorry - it just looked silly - him surveying the vista in his Fruit of the Looms. Another scene was at the end - after the explosive crash into the bulldosers - the announcer said that the impact was clocked at 180 mph. Then he mentions that the cops said his remains weren't found because he vaporized but some people believe he bailed out and was hidden by friends in the crowd. Then it shows him rolling out of the car at 180 mph! First of all you couldn't open the car door at 180 mph. Secondly the car would not continue to travel in a straight line for 100 yds. with nobody to steer it. It would promptly roll over about 30 times. Thirdly if you hit the pavement at 180 mph you would wind up in various squishy pieces. No matter we see him at the end standing with his daughter. All in all a movie that would insult anyone's intelligence. 
 When this movie was released it spawned one of the all-time great capsule movie reviews: Sphinx Stinks. It does but in a mesmerizing sort of way. The casting is silly starting at the top: Frank Langella and Sir John Gielgud as Egyptians? Not enough makeup in Cairo for that at least not while this film was being made. But it's rather amusing to see them try. The performances run the gamut from mummy-like (sorry the obvious observation) to over-the-top with very few stops in between. The Lesley-Anne Down character seems as though she couldn't find Egypt on a map much less expound upon its archaeological treasures. That's due at least in part to some really bad writing one of the curses that will be visited upon every viewer of this movie. It's my opinion that movies involving a curse or that draw their basis from a subject that is somewhat esoteric such as Egyptology are ripe for silly overwritten dialogue. It doesn't disappoint and the convergence proves a double-whammy. The plot has one driving source of dramatic tension: Can this get dumber and less believable? The answer is usually YES. The location shots are beautiful and the set design is generally very good the only consistent reminders that this wasn't some low-budget production. That and the fact that there are so many well-known faces doing service in such an unintentional laugher. Cheap no; cheesy yes. 
 Words cannot begin to describe how blandly terrible this movie is. I wish it were so bad it's good but it's not. It's just dull lifeless and boring. It's so bad I couldn't even laugh at it. In response to other posters Anne-Marie Frigon is not the highlight of the movie. The only person less charismatic is the director Brett Kelly who as a true statement on vanity cast himself as the male lead. They both look like inbreeds sister and brother. The gal Sherry Thurig is a looker. The complete opposite of Anne-Marie - attractive. This girl is tall and willowy and can act. Although you can tell she's holding back. All the actors seem to be holding back especially the supporting male Mark. I've seen less wood in a rain forest but he's still better than Kelly. Why would Kelly keep his actors from acting? Is he really that bad a director? Everyone else has summed the story up perfectly - there isn't one. Kids are kidnapped and Kelly steps in poo to solve the crime. I know how he felt stepping in the poo it's how I felt after watching his movie. Yes I tried to get my money back from the rental store. This is a home movie best left to be seen by the friends of the director (and if you search them out you'll see those same friends were the one who gave the movie positive marks). 
 All this dismaying waste of film stock needs is Count Floyd popping up every sixty seconds. Somehow they got Steve Railsback Susan Anspach John Vernon and Joe Flaherty together on a set and couldn't get within five miles about eight kilometers of an actual movie. BOY does this thing suck. There isn't one original line thought shot or effect from brainless opening sequence to brainless close. The magical ethereal Susan Anspach of Five Easy Pieces - boring. Steve Railsback - boring. John Vernon - boring. The big bug - boring. If this is a scary movie Buttercream Gang is a thuglife documentary. Seriously - every bad movie contains its own explanation of its badness. Usually it's in the opening credits - Written Directed and Produced by one guy. Or at the very center of the action is some bimbo so talentless that you know there's one and only one reason this turkey got made. Here you don't find out till the very last of the credits where the cooperation of about a dozen subfunctions of the Canadian Government is gratefully acknowledged. Right now I'm watching MST's take on Beast of Yucca Flats to get the taste out of my mouth. Ghod what an improvement. 
 Despite having known people who are either great fans of Noam Chomsky or think he's a tired relic from the 1960s I really had no opinion of the man save that I knew he gained fame as a linguist although I could not elucidate any of his theories and that he was a liberal socialist with Marxist leanings. So stumbling across the DVD of the 2003 documentary Noam Chomsky: Rebel Without A Pause in a used video store a film which followed him on a 2002 book tour for his book 9-11 I decided to get it just so I could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person pro or con spoke of him. While glad I got the film my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was so what's all the fuss about? For a man with so many degrees lauded as 'the most important intellectual alive' by the New York Times according to the DVD's case there sure was not a lot there intellectually speaking. I know I would chew him up and spit him out in a debate and I wouldn't even want to watch what a William F. Buckley could do to him. Granted the whole film was seemingly about Chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he'd say rather than being on linguistics so maybe that's the reason he came off so badly. But again if he is a linguist and tops in his field why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise??. Even worse are his acolytes who seem to further insulate the man from reality by fostering delusions that Chomsky is a target for Zionist assassins. What little I knew of Chomsky before watching this film this much I knew: he was generally considered a has been and pretty much irrelevant intellectually since the fall of the Soviet Empire. The film is so poorly structured and without a narrative thread that it's difficult to separate all of the jumble. His wife Carol as example apparently gave one interview which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film. She seems a nice enough woman but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life. The lone interesting thing she says is that 9/11 was a great thing for the Chomskys for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then. Not surprisingly this sort of film gives almost no biographical background. It's assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this 'great man' bears. Chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one. Stylistically there are no camera movements no interesting edits nor any signature touches and most of the film is disjunct rambles by Chomsky videotaped huzzahs of Chomsky declaiming on this or that and slack-jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him. This is really poor film-making by director and editor Will Pascoe who in the DVD's Filmmaker Statement shows he's yet another uncritical acolyte of Chomsky's. Other than that one of the surest signs that this is not an objective documentary but mere agitprop and a vanity piece of agitprop at that is that not a single time is Chomsky shown struggling with an answer. He seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds. Given that much of this dreck was filmed during Chomsky's lectures at McMaster University in Ontario Canada prior to the American invasion of Iraq in 2003 much of what Chomsky says seems as remote as things from the Vietnam War era. Yes he makes some good points here and there on American media complicity before the war but he follows them up with sheer lunacy for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc and not fully plotted out cabals. As example he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled. Similarly he claims Trilateralists run the world and that people's fear of crime is yet another cabal's result. Of course that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers and all that wasted time and money district attorneys' offices consume. He also makes the absurd claim that Cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades when Castro and company were great sponsors of it in Latin America Asia and Africa until the Soviet Union fell. I can only guess that the UFO conspiracists are just waiting for Chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species-mixing impregnation centers up in Idaho. In his simpleminded world without grays Chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of Bushco whom he reviles are; even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals. In short Chomsky is a man living in the past in over his head on most issues and out of his depth intellectually. Near this film's end he warns 'Be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice ' yet one can only laugh as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he didn't like no matter how barbarous their crimes and anti-intellectual their posit. Please pause before you waste your time and money on this silly and already irrelevant DVD. 
 A young basketball-playing professor of genetics is doing research on the genetic sequence using human fetuses. He hopes to be able to find a cure for all diseases and aging. He's pressured into concluding his research because he hasn't published so the university is having trouble justifying funding him (I think). He does a trial injection on a monkey which quickly dies. He then tries it on himself. He starts a relationship with the single mother of an extremely annoying little boy; she's the one who had been demanding results from the research. Initially he seems to have no effects from the injection except some new strength. He then realizes that he had some memory loss and starts recalling what happened. Additionally he starts to appear very unhealthy. Since the movie is named metamorphosis he does eventually change into something else. You won't believe your eyes - either what he turned into or the absolutely crappy costume the actor is wearing to depict what he's turned into. Incredibly there's a further change in store - the end of the movie is really really absurd. About the only thing this movie has going for it is that Laura Gemser is in it but she has a very small part. I'd once seen a the video box for this with a sculpted plastic form glued to the boxcover. Possibly it might even have had some electronics in it at one time perhaps eyes that light up (the main character's eyes occasionally turn green in the movie). The copy I watched had a box that only showed tear marks where the glue had held on the plastic which had been removed. The novelty boxcover if it still had it would have been the only reason I would have held onto this movie; I'm definitely getting rid of it. 
 Though I'd heard that Cama de Gato was the worst Brazilian movie of the decade I watched it giving it a chance; after all first-time director/producer/writer Alexandre Stockler managed to make his debut feature (shot in video) for just US$ 4 000 and -- though it looks even cheaper -- I can't begin to imagine all he went through to finally get it exhibited in theaters with no big sponsors or production companies behind it (then as I watched it I realized why). But whatever chances you're ready to give to Cama de Gato they shrink to zero within 10 minutes: it's an unbelievably preposterous verbose ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic attempt to portray Brazilian upper-middle class youth as a bunch of spoiled neo-Nazis hooked on bad sex drugs and violence (and they're made to look like closeted gays too) made with no visible trace of talent imagination expertise or notion of structure. Visually and aurally it recalls the worst amateur stuff you can find on YouTube -- only here it lasts NINETY TWO (count'em) minutes of unrelenting hysteria and clumsiness and it's not even funny-bad. We've all seen the story before: bored young guys want to have fun go partying take drugs and everything goes wrong -- there's gang-rape spanking murder the accidental death (falling down the staircase!!) of the mother of one of the boys culminating with the boys deciding to burn the corpses of the girl and the mother in a garbage landfill. Moral and literal garbage get it? The film is heavily influenced by Larry Clark (especially Kids and Bully ) but Clark's films -- though also moralist and sexploitative -- are high-class masterworks compared to this crap. I don't think there was ever such monomaniacal drive in a filmmaker to stick his ideas down the audience's throat: Stockler grabs us by the collar and tries to force his non-stop moralist rant into our brains by repetition and exhaustion -- you DO get numb-minded with so much babbling yelling inept direction shaky camera and terrible acting going on. Stockler doesn't care a bit about technique (the quality of the images framing sound recording soundtrack songs dialog sets editing etc is uniformly appalling) but he's a narcissistic control-freak: he anticipates the criticisms he's bound to get by adding subtitles with smartie/cutie comments and by making the protagonists comment at one point how far-fetched and phony it all is (I could relate to THAT). Despite his megalomaniac ambitions Stockler seems incapable of giving us a minimum of visual or narrative structure -- he can't even decide if he wants gritty realism (hand-held video camera etc) or stylization (repetition of scenes use of alternate takes etc). Damn he can't even decide WHERE to put his camera (there's use of subjective camera for the THREE leads)! The dialog features some of the most stupefyingly banal verbosity ever; the plot exists simply to justify the director's profound hatred for his characters and what they stand for. All you see is a filmmaker being hateful preachy condemning moralizing without the benefit of a minimum of talent (or technique) to go with it. It's very disappointing to find Caio Blat in this mess. Certainly one of the most promising young film actors in Brazil with his sleepy-eyed puppy dog looks and emotional edge that often recall Sal Mineo's Blat can be highly effective under good direction (as in Carandiru Lavoura Arcaica Proibido Proibir ). Here he's told to go over the top and he has to play with some of the most embarrassingly under-equipped actors in recent memory. He also enters the risky realm of graphic sexploitation scenes (so goddawful they look rather like web-cam porn). The film opens and ends with real interviews with typical (?) middle-class youth -- Stockler wants us to take those interviews as proof of what he's trying to preach in fiction. But he blatantly despises and makes fun of his interviewees selecting a highlight of abject racist sexist stupid statements (which only shows assholes exist everywhere). Stockler wants to prove that Brazilian middle-class youths are ALL present or future fascists BECAUSE they're middle-class and enjoy recreational drugs (is he saying all neo-fascists are on drugs?? Or that drugs potentialize fascist behavior?? I couldn't tell). With its dogmatic self-righteousness headache-inducing technique and mind-bending boredom Cama de Gato is bad for a 1 000 reasons but above all it's harmful in a very insidious manner: it gives detractors of Brazilian cinema a powerful case of argument. Cama de Gato is best unwatched unmentioned buried and forgotten. 
 ET's obsession with Dannielynn Smith is despicable. Leave the child alone. With all the constant attention she'll most likely grow up psychotic depressed or worse. Think of Princess Diana and how she longed for privacy. Now poor little rich girl Ashley Olson just wants to be left alone. No wonder Greta Garbo became a recluse and said I want to be alone . How much does ET make off this little girl? Does ET not have anything better to report on? I bet there's lots of people who really don't care what color her birthday cake and balloons were. By the way I never heard that Anna Nichole ever won any of those court cases over the will and her inheritance. Who is paying for the lifestyle of Larry Howard and little Dannielynn? Could it be ET? 
 Rumor has it that when the NASA Technical Advisors to this film were asked to keep the picture believable they laughed for several hours. After all unless you are a politician or work/crew the shuttle you are not going to get in the shuttle. Furthermore Space (Cadet) Camp is in Alabama not Florida. The truth is everyone on Earth will win multi-billion dollar lottery prizes before the events depicted in this film ever become possible. This film was meant for kids and had to have been written by one because they are not aware of the myriad restrictions and requirements regarding access to KSC/CCAFS. This is the most useless film of all time and it was a well deserved flop. 
 If you like a syfi soap opera this show is for you as fare as I am concerned it does not work for me and after watching 3 episodes I just can't watch it anymore. It is boring and slow and for a show that the timeline is based around 100.000+ years ago if you base it on battlestar galactica's timeline for arriving on earth they sure seem to have all the same stuff around like the 100.000 year old Chevy vans driving down the streets and people watching the 100.000 year old popular name brand LCD T.V. sets. It also goes the same with the rest of the sets as well on the show there is just to much of today's stuff involved in it to not overlook I think they could have done a lot better of a job to get around these issues and yes battlestar galactica had some of the same issues but not nearly as bad. As fare as the rest of the show it is not nearly as good as BSG was and it is a poor pre sequel to it?. 
 Jason Alexander is a wonderful actor but it's ridiculous to cast him as a cuddly romantic lead. The fact that he dances so well croons so effectively and throws himself into the part so completely somehow just made him seem all the more creepy. In his more cutesy moments (with the girl in the train station in the final number with Rosie) I couldn't take my eyes off him he was so repellent. You keep expecting him to drop the nice-guy act and start snarling. Vanessa Williams was the real star the only performance that was better than the 1963 movie. By the way if you see a production of the stage musical the 1963 movie and this 1995 movie you'll see three versions that have more revisions (different songs same songs assigned to different characters and in different situations) than any other musical I've ever seen. 
 Bad actors terrible script totally unbelievable ending - this film had it all. After seeing films like this you wonder why the makers bothered at all. This film has absolutely nothing to say all the methods used to create a scare have been used over and over again in previous horror films. A total waste of time. 
 Instead go to the zoo buy some peanuts and feed 'em to the monkeys. Monkeys are funny. People with amnesia who don't say much just sit there with vacant eyes are not all that funny. Black comedy? There isn't a black person in it and there isn't one funny thing in it either. Walmart buys these things up somehow and puts them on their dollar rack. It's labeled Unrated. I think they took out the topless scene. They may have taken out other stuff too who knows? All we know is that whatever they took out isn't there any more. The acting seemed OK to me. There's a lot of unfathomables tho. It's supposed to be a city? It's supposed to be a big lake? If it's so hot in the church people are fanning themselves why are they all wearing coats? 
 I have a severe problem with this show several actually. A simple list will suffice for now I'll go into more depth later on: superficial characters a laugh-track and boring humour. If you don't wish to look at the rest of this review and are only reading it so you can feel superior (as if you see anything in this show I didn't) to a frequently irked teen from Canada I'll summarize: Friends sucks not only because it is unfunny but because it destroyed the TV audiences for new good shows (Arrested Development Dexter etc.). Friends is as much to blame for reality TV Two And A Half Men and The King Of Queens as the television executives. Now then on with the review. These characters have no soul they are exactly the same in every way (outside of gender and hair colour). They react the same way in boring situations and are completely secure in their own bodies. Where is the conflict and the humour that comes with it? Why isn't Rachel storming out on Monica after Monica starts hanging out with Rachel's enemy? Why doesn't Joey contemplate suicide because nobody seems to take him seriously? Oh right cause he's the dumb one and he's comfortable with that. This is the curse of having perfect characters: lasting conflict and (god forbid) personality becomes an impossibility. The laugh-track is the one thing that should have died out right after it was born. Any show that has one is almost certainly the opposite of funny. How can I make such a broad generalization? When a show that claims to be comedy requires laughter from someone BESIDES THE AUDIENCE it must mean that the audience would not laugh without it. Laughtracks destroy humour by preventing quick comebacks. Humour becomes a construct rather than a free flowing entity (see The Office Arrested Development). This leads to my next point: the humour is boring. There is no way to make a perfect character anything more than slightly humorous (without a laugh-track apparently) simply because our everyday humour comes from recognition of our flaws. So what if Monica dated a 17 year old? She immediately recognizes that what she is doing isn't right and breaks up with him. There has to be some sort of conflict rather than an immediate solution. Maybe her mother finds out or one of her friends tries to get rid of him and ends up seducing him. That would be great it would be like a custody battle! So now I've provided evidence for my position. Many of my friends love this show because they haven't heard of Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development many of my friends hate this show because they recently started watching Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development. I have watched very little of Friends in my life but I have watched enough to spot huge flaws that make the show in my opinion completely unwatchable. If you've read this far thank you and I hope you at least start watching some of the shows I have mentioned. 
 In the beginning and throughout the movie it was great. It was suspenseful and thrilling. Yet in the end it gave no answer to what had happened. They mysteriously turned into zombies by a raven or crow? It did not answer the questions that we all had and therefore was not as good a movie as I thought that it was going to be. 
 I'm sorry but I didn't like this doc very much. I can think of a million ways it could have been better. The people who made it obviously don't have much imagination. The interviews aren't very interesting and no real insight is offered. The footage isn't assembled in a very informative way either. It's too bad because this is a movie that really deserves spellbinding special features. One thing I'll say is that Isabella Rosselini gets more beautiful the older she gets. All considered this only gets a '4.' 
 Whatever possessed Guy Ritchie to remake Wertmuller's film is incomprehensible. This new film is a mess. There was one other person in the audience when I saw it and she left about an hour into it. (I hope she demanded a refund.) The only reason I stayed through to the end was because I've never walked out of a movie. But I sat through this piece of junk thoroughly flabbergasted that Madonna and Ritchie could actually think they made a good film. The dialogue is laughable the acting is atrocious and the only nice thing in this film is the scenery. Ritchie took Lina's movie and turned it into another Blue Lagoon. This is a film that you wouldn't even waste time watching late night on Cinemax. Time is too precious to be wasted on crap like this. 
 I rented this film just to see Amber Benson though after reading the box I thought it sounded like a good story.....however the first problem was that there really wasn't a story...or actually there was a story but it made absolutely no sense. The second problem was there was no set up for these characters...yes I got that they all went to school together but within the first 3 minutes of the film you realized they had nothing else in common and didn't like each other...so why did they keep getting together. Flaw number 3...the director though long pauses and tight camera shots equaled suspense (especially with the typical suspense music dubbed in)...he was sadly mistaken. It was painful to watch a terrific actress like Amber Benson waste time trying to bring this back to life....my only hope is the money she made here was put toward producing her own film. 
 There was no characterization in this movie and really shows how much this talentless hack who directed this needs to learn his craft. All his characters in this movie were so unlikable and I could care less. The best point in this movie was the end credits and the hour long shower after this cause I felt so damn dirty that I wasted money on this stinking load. Hey genius....triads and yakuza are from two different places learn something about Asian culture. The dog scene in this felt so tacked on and useless. This DVD does prove useful I do love my new coaster. So kids don't waste your cash on this crap buy Hostel instead. 
 There is simply no use in trying to glorify any part of this film. It was straight up trash. At the very beginning you might think that you are in for a visually stunning piece of cinematography... and then shortly thereafter you are hit with a large sack (burlap) of FAIL! The fighting is barely martial the acting is teetering on the edge of par and the music is not worth describing. There is only enough of a story to have created an excuse for this film to have been made. The decisions that the characters make and the way that they deal with the situations is weak and did nothing but frustrate me. I think that the only reason this film came about was to act as a bit of fan service by using Yumiko Shaku. 
 as an actor I really like independent films but this one is amateur at best. The boys go to Vermont for a civil service yet when the plane lands it flies over a palm tree - were the directors aware that palm trees are not in Vermont? Pines yes - palms no. And the same for the wedding service - again nice grove of palm trees. When the boys are leaving VT they apparently could not get a ticket on any major airline since the plane that is filmed is Federal Express. Did they ship themselves Overnight in a crate? Come on guys little details like this separate an indi film from totally amateur. The Christian brother is far gayer than Arthur with his bleached hair and tribal band tattoo. The two should have switched roles. The minor characters are laughable and overact something terrible. Applause to the directors for making a gay film but pay some attention to your locations and casting next time 
 In a far away Galaxy is a planet called Ceta. It's native people worship cats. But the dog people wage war upon these feline loving people and they have no choice but to go to Earth and grind people up for food. This is one of the stupidest f#@k!ng ideas for a movie I've seen. Leave it to Ted Mikels to make a movie more incompetent than the already low standard he set in previous films. It's like he enjoying playing in a celluloid game of Limbo. How low can he go? The only losers in the scenario are US the viewer. Mr. Mikels and his silly little handlebar mustache actually has people who STILL buy this crap. My Grade: F DVD Extras: Commentary by Ted Mikels; the Story behind the Making of (9 and a half minutes); 17 minutes 15 seconds of Behind the scenes footage; Ted Mikels filmography; and Trailers for The Worm Eaters Girl in Gold Boots the Doll Squad Ten Violent Women (featuring nudity) Blood Orgy of the She Devils & the Corpse Grinders  
 Michael Jackson would have claimed a spot for the top-billed character in THE GOLDEN CHILD and because he loves kids. That didn't work (and why should it?) so instead we have Eddie Murphy out to save the world by rescuing Kid Midas . I would strongly suggest all future scriptwriters to please thoroughly study the actor's inane dialogue in this quirky fantasy - adventure - comedy that's a step closer to ISHTAR. Whatever Murphy says or does can be best liked but don't get me wrong about his exquisite comical talent; he doesn't belong in this movie and the same went for DR. DOLITTLE! The violence and visuals combined are reasons to stamp it as a cult camp classic and that wouldn't have made any sense as Hollywood and movie fanatics kept cashing in on the guy. Speaking of visuals they were pulled off amazingly well at the time of Ronald Reagan's presidential fame. Murphy is far better at COMING TO AMERICA and 48 HRS but this stale movie isn't my touch of golden honey for a sweet crunchy taste. 
 This show comes up with interesting locations as fast as the travel channel. It is billed as reality but in actuality it is pure prime time soap opera. It's tries to use exotic locales as a facade to bring people into a phony contest & then proceeds to hook viewers on the contestants soap opera style. It also borrows from an early CBS game show pioneer- Beat The Clock- by inventing situations for its contestants to try & overcome. Then it rewards the winner money. If they can spice it up with a little interaction between the characters even better. While the game format is in slow motion versus Beat The Clock- the real accomplishment of this series is to escape reality. This show has elements of several types of successful past programs. Reality television hardly but if your hooked on the contestants locale or contest this is your cup of tea. If your not this entire series is as I say drivel dripping with gravy. It is another show hiding behind the reality label which is the trend it started in 2000. It is slick & well produced so it might last a while yet. After all so do re-runs of Gilligan's Island Green Acres The Beverly Hillbillies & The Brady Bunch. This just doesn't employ professional actors. The intelligence level is about the same. 
 I came into this movie really wanting to line it. I thought the premise had a lot of potential and was ripe for an interesting movie. Don't get me wrong here I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane I was taking this for the B movie that it is. That said it still fell short of the expectation. The historical aspect of the story is glazed over and the ending left me a bit cold. The acting in the movie was very wooden. All in all I give it 4 for a great idea but the movie could have scored much higher with a bit more attention to movie making fundamentals. Is it worth seeing? I didn't wish for my two hours back but I don't know that I'd recommend it to others. 
 I have never watched a movie in so little time. The only salvation was the fast forward function on the DVD unit. It was like watching a poorly produced CBC film. There was obviously no money for lighting filming sets location scriptwriters editors actors... Oh there was absolutely no story either! I need to write ten lines of comment... Bad awful horrible wretched anguishing tortuous bilious nauseous sickening fromage disgusting flimsy icky yucky pukey stinky smelly vile putrid all-thumbs-down and I don't know if I can keep on going to complete all ten lines of just how bad this piece of crap-o-matic production was! 
 I saw the trailer for this film a few months prior to its release and MAN did it look scary Especially how this film was based on a real life phenomenon. I was incredibly interested and thought that this could finally be a decent horror/thriller film after years if crap. Well you know how movie trailers make a film look better than it is: maybe by showing all of the creepy parts or by overdramaticizing certain elements. The advertisements for the movie did both which lead to my ultimate disappointment. By no means is this the most disturbing movie in years . Hell I doubt it was the most disturbing movie of that week's release. This movie takes the whole based off of fact thing too far. This movie wasn't complete crap. I must admit it held my interest and Micheal Keaton was believable as a man searching for answers by supernatural means. Other than that though this film is one big clich. After John's wife dies he learns about EVP which transmits the voices of the dead into everyday electronic appliances. He all of the sudden receives messages from his wife! My God! It's not just his wife reaching him it's other dead people. Gee imagine that. A movie about helping dead people. Come on give me a break! The clichs don't stop there. There's also the obligatory clock-stopping-at-the-same-exact-time-every-night trick and three evil spirits that menace our hero. Not only was the movie clich it WASN'T SCARY. The film literally had two jump scenes and those two scenes are almost identical. The ending is horrible as it leaves the door WIDE OPEN for a sequel. There's also an ending message with a message saying how only 1 out of X voices heard through EVP are threatening with a nice happy tune playing. Way to break the mood you guys. Jeez! In the end if you want another forgettable horror film see White Noise. The only reasons I could possibly think anyone would watch this film for is that either that the person is a Keaton fan or that they are interested in EVP. Sure the EVP aspects may be slightly interesting but I don't like my movie concepts to be shoved down my throat and blown up in my face. This film tries to be scary original and disturbing but it's just the opposite. You know you have a lame movie when the commercials use the ghosts to talk about there film. I WILL SEE THIS FILM NO MORE.  
 I see people writing about how great this movie was. It was horrible! The acting was sub-par at best. It made a lot of money because teenage girls went to see the movie 7 times in the theaters because of Leonardo. Where the hell did they get the money? Anyway I wanted to learn more about the Titanic; why it sank what was running through a lot of people's minds; maybe even a little conspiracy stuff. Does anyone realize that certain people didn't even board the ship because there was a fire on board before it even took off? No you don't because all you see is a rich girl falling for a poor boy and he paints her naked (did that corny junk at least tip you off that the movie was stupid?). I did cry in during one scene though. The scene when they showed the water that was filling up in the ship. It looked like pool water! I'm thinking this movie made all this money and they couldn't even make the water from the ocean look real? unbelievable... Ohhh the band played on while the ship sank.. Just ridiculous. This was the worst movie until Pearl Harbor outdid it in the Nothing to Do With Reality department. 
 As a physics student I've become aware of many idiot professors and other so-called experts in the field. As I continue with my studies I learn more and more about real physics experiments going on and about the people who are doing things right. Then my friends tell me of this physics movie they want to see. Knowing nothing of it I'm excited hoping that the information will be presented well. I've done REAL quantum mechanics; this wasn't it. This movie starts with the basic assumption that anything that occurs to a subatomic particle can and will occur to you if you just open your eyes. Let's think about that for just a moment. Our bodies are composed of somewhere around 10^30 such subatomic particles. That is a million billion billion billion particles! The more mysterious quantum effects of just two particles can have a 50% probability of cancelling each other out completely. As you add more and more particles into the mix it becomes almost impossible to have a large net quantum result. To tell us to believe that this is a valid assumption with no rationality behind it...it's just stupid. My friend also in physics and I counted 3 facts during the course of this movie. But they were presented in the most misleading manner I've EVER SEEN. I cannot say as much for the neural portion of the movie as I have not had any kind of medical training. It seemed as though it might have had a slight bit more truth to it remembering my days in biology but I cannot say. At least this film had a redeeming quality: the dancing peptides (or whatever they actually were) scene. Not to ruin the invaluable plot that drives this movie but the main character goes to a wedding where she sees all different types of personalities driven by their peptides* and then the film cuts to the dance floor where we are spliced between people dancing sometimes surrounded by CG peptides and a fully CG scene filled with dancing peptides. The film at that point was trying to tell us how we're addicted to emotions so we're treated to the full song of that smash hit Addicted to Love. This scene was redeeming because anyone who could go through THAT scene and still take this movie seriously...well you are the ones that need to open your eyes.  
 The interplay between the characters is a moral disaster. You end up disliking most of the characters and you don't particularly like any of them. Even the two main characters played by David and Gwen are so badly written that you really don't care one bit about them. The movie has no plot no direction and no purpose. The single redeeming quality of the movie was to treat it as a glimpse into the messed up lives of a few losers - and that's hardly stimulating even as an afternoon waste. 
 Well after three times through I still have no idea what this movie is about because quite honestly it failed to generate any real interest or concern. But here it goes: A bunch of too old to be teen Teen Actors dressed in horrifying latter 1980's fashions (did WE look like that too??) decide it would be a really good idea to get in a motorboat and go visit the abandoned Alcatraz after one of them has nightmares of people being slaughtered in various horrifying ways that manage to rip off POLTERGEIST THE EVIL DEAD and Freddy Kreuger in one fell swoop. The dimwit even envisions himself being roasted over an open fire with some deformed freak slicing off strips of tenderloin. Good thing it was only a dream or it might have hurt and good thing his dreams had a decent special effects budget. Mine are usually pretty lame: Girls model space ships blowing things up with a bazooka etc. Once on the Alcatraz island they find themselves in a Slasher movie and meet up with Tony Basil who cannot help but break into a couple dance poses at times and had her own lighting crew (complete with a smoke machine for that 1980's smoky haze infused light look which I kind of miss). And such reminded me that Ms. Basil helped choreograph David Byrne of the Talking Heads for some of his videos and performances. This of course has nothing at all to do with the film but kept popping into mind as the movie posed very little to actually think about. It sort of happens and you can either watch or keep working on your page markup with it on the TV set off to the side. But since the film isn't really interesting you'll keep deciding to finish one last thing instead of wasting time the movie will keep ending and you'll find yourself wondering what you missed every time you realize the end credits are starting to roll again dammit ... *SOME* 1980's Teen Horror movies can survive such specialized viewing: Umberto Lenzi's GHOSTHOUSE CHOPPING MALL & it's Killbots the hard to ignore NIGHT OF THE CREEPS and the over-the-top SLEEPAWAY CAMP all come to mind. They are films that like them or not demand your attention and usually pay off with some good gore or T&A and typos in your work as evidence that you were watching the TV instead of your keyboard. I am sure that HELL ISLAND (as the British version I glommed onto is titled) does indeed have some good stuff in there but frankly I don't care. And nothing is more annoying that encountering art of any genre that doesn't inspire admiration some decent dislike or even good old honest hatred for it. The film is content with simpering away 80-whatever minutes of time and never really accomplishing anything more than being a sometimes distraction in spite of my best efforts to try and give it a chance but no dice. There is some offbeat production design going on the use of lighting is striking at times and the occasional outburst of mayhem will probably keep fans of 1980's Teen Horror interested. The rest of you be warned though: YOU WILL WONDER IF YOU DRESSED LIKE THAT IN 1987 and the answer is probably more hideous than anything which happens on screen. Try to watch it as a free rental if possible so that if disappointed you aren't stuck with the damn thing: Movies like this take up valuable shelf space that is often at a commodity these days what with the world coming to an end & all ... 
 I picked up this video after reading the text on the box the story seemed good and it had Keanu Reeves! But after 5 minutes of watching I noticed how horrible his acting was he walks and talks so stupid the whole time it's fake and not convincing. It doesn't end there almost ALL the characters act so badly it's laughable the only acceptable acting was by Alan Boyce (David) but the guy commits suicide early on and you don't see him again you never even know why he did it! Everything about this movie screams low quality I can't believe how such a thing gets released! I was tempted many times to stop watching in fact I did half way through it I decided to stop watching and turned the thing off came to the IMDB to check what other's thought about it I found zero comments (not surprised) so I decided to force myself to handle the pain and go back to finish it then come here to comment on it. The only good thing going (for me) was the high-school Rock band theme the occasional guitar playing and singing parts but that's not worth it. Very bad acting and directing... Terrible movie. 
 I cringed all the way through this movie. First of all the idiotic plot has little to do with Parson's own story. Hollywood has attempted to create a kind of comedy car chase movie. Imagine Englebert Sings Hendrix . Do not take anything about this movie to be accurate. The name Parsons in the title and stealing of his body is just used as springboard for a low budget chase movie a blatant attempt to grab a few bucks from the Parsons legacy and his fan base. Gram's father had long since been dead in 1973 the other global characters are fictional none of this has anything to do with Grams life or death. If you are a Gram fan I advise you to not see this movie. I wish I hadn't. It's saddening to see something special be treated as such disgracing fodder. I'd swear I could hear Gram turning in his grave while the movie was playing. If you are not familiar with Gram's life and legacy do not take anything in this movie as being representative of Gram. I cannot say enough bad things about this movie. If Gram were alive and saw this movie he would kill himself. Then again maybe he'd be afraid to if he knew this movie were to result. 
 This movie is once again one of those movies that someone thinks or tries to make others think that they understood it. Anyone who tries to make any sense of this is a MORON! My advise would be to take TWO not one but TWO hits of very strong acid and at least you'll get a visual thrill out of it!! Although at the end you may kill yourself for wasting your acid!!!! Being that this comment requires 10 lines of info let me write something for those of you that will try to defend the movie. Unintelligble. Garbage. Schitzoid. Waste of talent. Movie is ice with paper on destination with ringing clouds on a sunny dive in the pudding.... Sounds like lion in a red light with seeing hair. Now explain that to me!!!! 
 We expected something great when we went to see this bomb. It is basically a Broadway play put on film. The music is plain terrible. There isn't one memorable song in the movie -- heard any hits from this movie? You won't because there aren't any. Some of the musical numbers go on so long that I got up to go to the restroom and get some pop corn and it was still going when I got back! If they were good songs well -- but they suck. The pace is slow terrible character development. The lead was praised for her singing but sounded like she screamed every song -- it was almost impossible to stand. This movie has NOTHING to offer anyone but die-hard Broadway enthusiasts. This is without a doubt the most over rated movie I've seen in my entire life. A complete waist of time and money. There is nothing memorable about this movie except Danny Glover -- who wasn't on screen enough and whose character wasn't developed enough. Rent the video and you'll agree -- this movie was an expensive over produced polished dog do. 
 This movie had potential but what makes it really bad is Lindsay Crouse's acting. I've never seen her before in anything else and maybe there are some Crouse fans out there that like her in something else but her performance in this movie is bad. Her delivery is robotic. When she delivered her lines it appeared that she was trying to make sure she had the lines right and was simply reading off the list in her head. So her voice has very little inflection. I can't believe someone that bad at acting was given a lead role in a movie. She has to know somebody in the biz. Now I hate to be this mean about her but the comment has to be this long and her performance is what sticks out more than anything else. However I liked where the story was going so I continued to watch it. The first part of the script has the makings of a good movie. But the end was disappointing as well. Maybe if her acting had been better I would have liked it. 
 Not the greatest film to remember Paul Naschy by. Gaston (Guillermo Bredeston) is probably the worst swordsman I have ever seen. Zorro would be ashamed! His only salvation came as the competition was just as bad. This film is described as adventure and horror. Forget the horror - there is none. No nudity no blood no monsters; just a Robin Hood adventure against an evil Baron (Paul Naschy) who wants to be King. The main feature of the film was seeing Graciela Nilson who only made four films in two years and disappeared to our regrettable loss. Where did she go? 
 save your money. i have been a fan of fullmoon productions for a long time and i have never seen them make a movie as bad as this. the casting is terrible the story is even worse and the special affects are worse than any movie iv'e seen sence the 80's. this movie is so bad i cant even suggest renting it. 
 I watched this film few times and all i can say that this is low budget rubbish and that it does not have anything to do with a real history facts. Actors performances is very poor but it is result of limited acting possibilities. Anyone who watched this film now probably think of Hitler as some crazy skinny lunatic who running with a gun like some Chicago gangster. I can only to say that there is much better films about Hitler and Germany in those years and that Rise of evil is very much under average. I can recommend German film Downfall in which you can see brilliant performance of Switzerland actor Bruno Ganz in a roll of Adolf Hitler. 
 Oh my. How can they make movies of such beauty but that are so terribly bad. I mean even Uwe Boll doesn't make crap like this. There is not even a hint of a decent story multi-layered characters or attraction. It's just a random sequence of pointless chatter joined together to make a 'movie'. I suppose only children up to 3 years of age could enjoy it given the world is so utterly dimensionless and the story so incoherent that anyone older would be annoyed by it. But then again it's far too scary for anyone under 6 years of age that there's probably no one that should watch this movie at all. Take my advice and stay far far away from this movie. Your little daughter can make a better storyline and though she probably isn't able to draw pictures this pretty her tales are much more worth listening to. And please in the name of whoever you believe in do not expose your children to this piece of ****. I'll give it 2 out of 10 and that's exclusively for the graphics because the story and character development are so awful they'd deserve a negative rating. And if you decide to watch it anyways... remember that I warned you. 
 I saw this recently with my wife and discovered it's better than Caine believes although it's not much cop. Britain's greatest ever screen actor does not seem too interested in this role which is a pity as he might have elevated it with more conviction in his playing. Rex Harrison seems even less bothered perhaps unsurprisingly as his character is very poorly written. William Holden is better but his screen time is fleeting and again his character is not well scripted. Beverly Johnson is as beautiful a woman as I have ever seen but is given very little to do the film might have gained a great deal by concentrating more on her story. Ustinov steals the show but basically by playing a comic character quite out of keeping with the film's serious tone. The music is poor and Omar Sharif makes one of his many pointless cameos (his career has been based on this for decades now). Richard Fleischer has to be blamed for not directing this more effectively he was an infuriatingly unpredictable film director and this is one of his weaker movies. 
 A handful of nonprofessional actors are terrorized by a prehistoric creature. This creature appears in about thirty seconds of marginal stop-motion animation but oh how you will long for that margin when for the rest of the movie the animation is replaced by production assistants waving around an inner tube with teeth. No time for terror when this movie is hijacked halfway through by these comic relief boat rental doofuses who suddenly become the lead characters; but again you gotta admit watching them try to be funny is better than plodding around after the sheriff. Only at the end one of them gets eaten and the other one is left sitting on a rock crying tears of loneliness - that's no fun! 
 How low can someone sink while trying to recapture an old glory? ST:HF will be glad to show you. If you are used to seeing what made for a good Star Trek show do NOT watch this. The writing is hodge-podge the actors' portrayals of their characters weak and most of all the design work is downright doggy. Like watching strong captains don't look here! Like the strong Federation attitude? Forget about it here! Starfleet is mocked by ensigns wearing SPIKES in their hair. While a seemingly mentally feeble captain shuffles about and within two minutes of the opening show's credits Ensign Spikey is attempting to arrange a tryst with an engineer. It just degrades from there. No not even uniforms match for goodness sake. They are too small or too big collars down to their chests and TNG Seasons One and Two Uniforms mixed in with Season Three and DS9 uniforms. The strict discipline and tradition of any of the originals in lacking in this production down to the treads! The only good thing about this show is its graphics which seem to improve a bit with each season. OK I take that back. Who uses CG that inexpertly? The designers of this show. Don't bother with it it will offend your Star Trek sense as it did mine. Not even the throw backs to previous shows can save this catastrophe. I wept openly when i watched this probably because my eyes were bleeding and my head almost ruptured. That bad. 
 I feel like I've just watched a snuff film....a beautifully acted taut engrossing and horrible thing! A two hour litany of perversion in the most basic and all inclusive sense of the word sexual violence and torture rape decapitation incest corruption live burial and abuse abuse abuse. No redemption whatsoever. And I WAS entertained. I couldn't stop watching. What does this say about me about the people who make and act in this sort of thing and a world that has become so desensitized that eventually real snuff films will be the norm. And I'm neither puritanical nor humorless I don't try to hide from the existence of darkness and I definitely have not led a sheltered life but I am ashamed of myself. AND I'm sorry to see my British cousins dragging the subject-matter sewers the way my own tribe does. It doesn't have to be cozy but does it have to wallow in vicarious sadism? 
 I'm glad I rented this movie for one reason: its shortcomings made me want to read Allende's book and get the full story. Pros: the movie is beautiful the period is depicted well and consistently (to the best of my knowledge) and Meryl and Glenn do good jobs. Cons: This is the worst acting job I've ever seen from Jeremy Irons--I kept wondering if something was wrong with his mouth. (And I hate the terribly English way he says Transito. ) Winona Ryder does nothing believable except look young and idealistic. Most of the other performances are OK but so few things hang together in the character arcs and the relationship development that I was frustrated and angry well before the end. I'm very curious now whether this movie is typical of Bille August's work. I may have to drop another couple of bucks to rent Smilla's Sense of Snow. 
 I will give it a 3 just because it showed history that we need to know about to prevent it from happening again. I agree with the comments from the gentleman from UK. The movie was pretty terrible. All clich no real plot. Historical and technical inaccuracies abound. Look up the technical specs on DE 529 or any Everts class Destroyer Escort and you will see what I mean. I now its black history month in the US and Im going to be called a racist just for saying this but the history of this ship is not that great. They did some escort work chased a submarine that turned out to be a hulk that they rammed. Sorry but black people did a lot more in WWII then this silly movie gives them credit for. This movie makes them look like whiners. Let the name calling commence I can handle it. 
 Unless you're twelve this movie really isn't worth it. It's obviously a low-budget film with B actors and with a genre like fantasy that sometimes requires intense CGI work that's not good. I knew it would be bad when I rented it. I enjoy laughing at bad movies. I didn't know how bad though. It's bearable until after hour 2 then it really starts to burn. Fighting styles go between normal fighting that obey the laws of physics and wire-fighting. There's no real explanation for the transitions. It has a plot but once again it's obviously a kid's movie. It seems like there are explicit moral lessons of the day that are being conveyed like Sesame Street or something. It's bearable. But much better if you're say nine. 
 This film like the first one ( The Man From Snowy River ) has the same good and bad features perhaps even more so than the original. Unfortunately the bad outweighs the good. The GOOD - Magnificent scenery better than the first film. I love those high country shots in Australia. Tom Burlinson is still a likable guy as Jim Craig. Bruce Rowland did a nice job with the music too. The BAD - Once again we get an extremely obnoxious feminist heroine Jessica (Sigrid Thornton) who is a world-class pouter with an extremely annoying face and manner about her. In this film we also get a big downgrade in who pays the father. Previously it was Kirk Douglas now replaced by the always -profane Brian Dennehy. Speaking of that it is a disgrace that a Walt Disney film would includes usages of the Lord's name in vain. That was one reason was almost totally down the tubes in the 1980s. This film like the first one 
 Airport '77 starts as a brand new luxury 747 plane is loaded up with valuable paintings & such belonging to rich businessman Philip Stevens (James Stewart) who is flying them & a bunch of VIP's to his estate in preparation of it being opened to the public as a museum also on board is Stevens daughter Julie (Kathleen Quinlan) & her son. The luxury jetliner takes off as planned but mid-air the plane is hi-jacked by the co-pilot Chambers (Robert Foxworth) & his two accomplice's Banker (Monte Markham) & Wilson (Michael Pataki) who knock the passengers & crew out with sleeping gas they plan to steal the valuable cargo & land on a disused plane strip on an isolated island but while making his descent Chambers almost hits an oil rig in the Ocean & loses control of the plane sending it crashing into the sea where it sinks to the bottom right bang in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle. With air in short supply water leaking in & having flown over 200 miles off course the problems mount for the survivor's as they await help with time fast running out... Also known under the slightly different tile Airport 1977 this second sequel to the smash-hit disaster thriller Airport (1970) was directed by Jerry Jameson & while once again like it's predecessors I can't say Airport '77 is any sort of forgotten classic it is entertaining although not necessarily for the right reasons. Out of the three Airport films I have seen so far I actually liked this one the best just. It has my favourite plot of the three with a nice mid-air hi-jacking & then the crashing (didn't he see the oil rig?) & sinking of the 747 (maybe the makers were trying to cross the original Airport with another popular disaster flick of the period The Poseidon Adventure (1972)) & submerged is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside either suffocate when the air runs out or drown as the 747 floods or if any of the doors are opened & it's a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic character's dull dialogue lethargic set-pieces & a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity. While the rather sluggish plot keeps one entertained for 108 odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks & there's not as much urgency as I thought there should have been. Even when the Navy become involved things don't pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships & helicopters flying about but there's just something lacking here. George Kennedy as the jinxed airline worker Joe Patroni is back but only gets a couple of scenes & barely even says anything preferring to just look worried in the background. The home video & theatrical version of Airport '77 run 108 minutes while the US TV versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence many more scenes with George Kennedy as Patroni flashbacks to flesh out character's longer rescue scenes & the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the navigator. While I would like to see this extra footage I am not sure I could sit through a near three hour cut of Airport '77. As expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions & interior design choices I will say no more other than the toy plane model effects aren't great either. Along with the other two Airport sequels this takes pride of place in the Razzie Award's Hall of Shame although I can think of lots of worse films than this so I reckon that's a little harsh. The action scenes are a little dull unfortunately the pace is slow & not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as I reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properly. The production values are alright if nothing spectacular. The acting isn't great two time Oscar winner Jack Lemmon has said since it was a mistake to star in this one time Oscar winner James Stewart looks old & frail also one time Oscar winner Lee Grant looks drunk while Sir Christopher Lee is given little to do & there are plenty of other familiar faces to look out for too. Airport '77 is the most disaster orientated of the three Airport films so far & I liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly the production & bland direction doesn't help though & a film about a sunken plane just shouldn't be this boring or lethargic. Followed by The Concorde ... Airport '79 (1979). 
 If you were to judge based on the movie alone the committee that gave the stage musical A Chorus Line a Pulitzer Prize and Broadway audiences that kept the war horse running for 15 years were all on heavy narcotics because one singular sensation this film certainly is NOT. What possessed anyone to think that Richard Attenborough was the right fit for this material utterly mystifies me but he makes a musical that is almost entirely about movement just sit on the screen like a lump of clay. Not content with the original score the way it was originally written someone decided that what the film really needed was a brand new song to give the movie some zip. Thus we are assaulted with the Oscar-nominated(!) Surprise Surprise. Well surprise surprise the song stinks and so does the movie. Grade: D 
 Pet Sematary though a nice 80's Horror movie with a nice Director and atmosphere IS a copy of the Italian movie ZEDER by Pupi Avati. It's clear that Stephen King has copied almost all the ideas from this director (the movie Zeder was made before King wrote the book) The cat the ground everything was copied this is a case of plagiary but being Stephen Kind a famous American writer it's totally normal that he can get away with this it's obviously due to the huge difference between this kind of Italians movies with no -budget (and in part it's crap itself ... ) but the original idea I repeat it it's Italian director Avati Let the world know 
 This was a very brief episode that appeared in one of the Night Gallery show back in 1971. The episode starred Sue Lyon (of Lolita movie fame) and Joseph Campanella who play a baby sitter and a vampire respectively. The vampire hires a baby sitter to watch his child (which appears to be some kind of werewolf or monster) while he goes out at night for blood. The baby sitter is totally oblivious to the vampire's appearance when she first sees him and only starts to put two and two together when she notices that he has no reflection in the mirror has an odd collection of books in the library on the occult and hears strange noises while the vampire goes to talk to the child. She realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought he was originally. She bolts out the door the vampire comes out looking puzzled and the episode is over. I don't know what purpose it was to make such an abbreviated episode that lasted just 5 minutes. They should just have expanded the earlier episode by those same 5 minutes and skipped this one. A total wasted effort. 
 This is an amateur movie shot on video not an electrifying drama as the DVD liner notes falsely boast. I have seen much better stuff from undergrad film students. The bulk of the story unfolds with an all-nite taxi ride around Jakarta. This movie could have been made using a single video camera but there are a few sections where two cameras were used and the content was bounced together later. The editing is extremely rough. The final edit was probably done with two cameras bouncing content back and forth instead of with a proper editor. Perhaps they did the editing in the taxi too? The English subtitles were written by someone not fluent in English e.g. Where you go now? To say the production quality is on a par with Blair Witch is generous. If you're not scared away yet this film was an ambitious and creative endeavor with lots of cool and funky images from all over Jakarta. 
 Ned aKelly is such an important story to Australians but this movie is awful. It's an Australian story yet it seems like it was set in America. Also Ned was an Australian yet he has an Irish accent...it is the worst film I have seen in a long time 
 This film might have weak production values but that is also what makes it so good. The special effects are gross out and well done. My favorite part of the movie had to be Chrissy played by Janelle Brady. She is super hot and also has a good nude scene. Robert Prichard as the leader of the gang is hilarious as are the other members. This film is actually trying to make a point by saying that nuclear waste plants are bad. 4/10 Fair comedy gross out film. 
 I sat through this turkey because I hadn't seen it before and because the premise sounded like it had potential. It was mildly entertaining until the hurricane sequence. At the height of the storm the wind is strong enough to blow windows out of the house yet the trees in the background are perfectly upright and not a leaf is moving! In fact when the characters move outside the house bright sunlight is visible illuminating the treetops. At that point whatever credence the filmmakers had developed evaporated faster than the highly localized rain in their film. Too bad all hurricanes aren't like this one it would surely help our homeowners insurance rates here in the Sunshine State. 
 A response to previous comments made by residents of the region where this motion picture was lensed: One person suggested that the closing and destruction of the Ocean View Amusement Park led to a downturn in the surrounding neighborhoods. This is simply not true. Prior to the construction of Interstate 64 which bypasses the Ocean View area the primary route for traffic went through the heart of Ocean View. Once the interstate was completed Ocean View rapidly became a ghost town with businesses closing up and an increase in crime. This led to a huge reduction in revenues for the park which also faced new competition from nearby Busch Gardens in Williamsburg. Meanwhile in the past few years the City of Norfolk has done a remarkable job of fostering redevelopment so that the area has become a sought-after location for construction of high-end housing. It has also been said that the destruction footage of the roller coaster was used in the film Rollercoaster . This is also untrue. Footage was shot of two coaster cars careening off the ride for that film but the actual explosions and collapse are exclusive to Death of Ocean View Park . As to the film itself the storyline of a supernatural force in the water adjacent to the park was certainly silly but somewhat typical for B-grade movies of the time. With the cast involved there should be no surprise that the scenery was gnawed in almost every scene by the primary actors. I don't believe this film was intended to be another Citizen Kane ; I believe Playboy was experimenting with a new non-nude format to determine if this was an area for the company to expand into (apparently not!). A strange force in the water causing strange events in an old amusement park probably sounded good at the conference table but proved unmanageable in execution. The roller coaster and the rest of the park was destined for the wrecking ball anyway; let's come up with a weird way to justify an explosive demise! . For the casual movie viewer this would be a see once and forget about it film (except for Diana Canova fans); but for the thousands of people who live in the region and have fond memories of the park this movie is like a walk down memory lane for footage of the park as well as old footage of downtown Norfolk the first Harborfest and Old Dominion University. Even a limited release of this film on DVD would be welcome. 
 I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I never thought he would work on a movie like this. I couldn't believe the other reviews and I thought it shouldn't be bad to watch it at least once...but trust me it is. I haven't seen the old movie..but why would they want to remake a movie like this. The very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic. This film doesn't fall under any of those and just remains dumb.I just kept watching the movie hoping it would get interesting at some point but it never does. So this movie is a big no no for both Horror movie fans as well as for the Cage fans. You could probably for it show up on television. 
 This is a fascinating film--especially to old movie buffs and historians (I am both). During the first half of the twentieth century sadly Black Americans were usually not allowed into White theaters. As a result theaters catering to Black audiences wanted to show films reflecting the Black experience and showing Black actors. In many cases the films were essentially similar plot-wise to standard Hollywood fare but with a much much lower budget--and usually horrid production values. You really can't fault the film makers--they just didn't have the money and resources available to the average film company. As a result they had to make due with a lot less--including an over-reliance on stock actors that were seen again and again no money for re-shooting scenes and a need to get the films done FAST! This film tried very hard to be a Black version of a Gene Autry film--starring Herb Jeffries instead. Jeffries was a light-skinned man from mixed ancestry and he starred in several similar cowboy films. In each he sings a little fights a little (though VERY poorly) and loves a little--everything you need in a cowboy. Believe it or not Jeffries is STILL alive at age 96. The general plot was indiscernible from an Autry picture--complete with anachronistic items such as telephones out West! The problem is that despite its similarities the low budget shines through. Stymie (from the Li'l Rascals) flubbed a few lines but they just left it in the fight scenes were totally unchoreographed and were among the worst ever put on film there were some odd plot holes there was no background music (leaving the film strangely quiet) and the acting was pretty awful. Now this does NOT mean that the film isn't worth seeing--only that it abouts with technical problems that prevent it from being scored higher. One reviewer oddly scored this film a 10! How this can be with all the problems is beyond me. However I can understand a person liking the film despite its many problems. The plot is generally pretty good the characters likable the musical numbers excellent and you know that the people making the film tried so darn hard AND it's a very important piece of American history. But a 10!? By the way in an odd bit of casting the very tall lean and almost white-skinned Jefferies is paired with short dumpy and exceptionally dark Mantan Moreland....as his brother!! Also Spencer Williams may be familiar to you. He played Andy on TV's Amos 'n Andy . 
 This movie is awful. At the end of it you will realize that several hours have been stolen from your life that you can't get back. The twist ending is very contrived. The character development leading up to this ending is not consistent with their final actions at the conclusion. Ninety minutes of preparation-- with the premise that the Rob Lowe character will die on Christmas Eve-- is explained away in literally ninety seconds of No we were just tricking you. Then the Rob Lowe character is not even upset about it! I will forgive you if you can forgive me is as upset as he gets. If someone took weeks to convince me I was about to die and then said No sorry just fooling you I would raise some serious hell. I don't feel bad about giving away the spoiler because I might be able to save some of you out there from watching. Please save yourself and DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE. 
 This film makes you really appreciate the invention of the fast forward button on your remote control. It's exquisite boredom in beautiful pictures. For once Hamilton goes relatively easy on soft focus shots. However what I found hard to take about the film was that although Anja Schte was about 19 when it was shot the girls are portrayed as much younger than they actually are. This whole Lolita thing especially as there is an older man involved leaves me rather uneasy. The heroine is actually shaved in the pubic area in order to make her look even younger than she is. Come on sex is a nice past time- between consenting adults. Another thing I found odd was that neither Beart nor Schte have a nude scene in the film well not a proper one at least. 
 I can't say much about this film. I think it speaks for itself (as do the current ratings on here). I rented this about two years ago and I totally regretted it. I even /tried/ to like it by watching it twice but I just couldn't. I can safely say that I have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time ever ever again. And I'm not one to trash a movie but I truly believe this was awful. It wasn't even funny in the slightest. The only bits I enjoyed were the few scenes with Christopher Walken in them. I think this film ruined both Jack Black and Ben Stiller for me. All I can think of when I see one of their films now-a-days is this terrible movie and it reminds me not to waste my money. Amy Poehler is so very annoying too. Overall well I think you get my point. The stars are for Walken by the way. 
 Something I really love about this woman's short films was the elusiveness of theme -- especially in Living with Happiness. This film has some nice beginnings -- unusual location and the potential for a strange cinematic treatment but fails to succeed with clunky expositional dialogue patchy performances and very television coverage. It's once again charming television and very ordinary cinema. The ideas are so fleshed out that they almost feel pat like a television commercial. But the sentiment is good so we can't complain too much. I really would love to see this director make a full length animation and try and work with a producer who doesn't demand so much boring clarity. 
 One thing that astonished me about this film (and not in a good way) was that Nathan Stoltzfus who seems to pride himself on being the major historian on the topic of the Rosenstrasse was one of the historians working on this film considering how much of the actual events were altered or disregarded. Another reviewer said that von Trotta said she never meant for Lena to bed Goebbels but in that case why did she give every impression that that was what had happened? Why not show other possible reasons for the mens' release such as the disaster that was Stalingrad or the Nazis' fear that the international press based in Berlin would find out about the protest. Also why did the whole storyline play second fiddle to a weak family bonding storyline that has been done over and over again? Surely something as awesome as this could carry its own history! In places it was as if the film had two story lines that really seemed to have little in common. Overall this film failed in its aim which was to draw attention to a little-known act of resistance which is a shame because done better it could have had a major impact. 
 ALL FOR LOVE ( as it titled when it was broadcast at the weekend ) is a romantic period drama featuring Captain Saint Ives a French officer in Napoleon`s army who is captured by the British and imprisoned in Scotland where he meets and falls in love with a young maiden who visits the prison . There`s also a storyline involving a murder . I will be honest and confess that I wasn`t too taken by the movie since I`m not much of a fan of period dramas and the screenplay feels somewhat episodic but I will say that this is well acted by everyone involved and it`s got a good cast that features Miranda Richardson Anna Friel Richard E Grant Michael Gough and Jason Isaacs . The costume design as you can expect is also excellent I`ll be very surprised if this movie doesn`t get any complaints after being broadcast on BBC2 at teatime . Captain Saint Ives lies in bed with a prostitute where a nipple is fully exposed and there`s a scene of French prisoners bathing that includes full frontal male nudity not to mention a murder scene where blood is clearly seen . You really do have to worry if BBC schedulers have any type of clue as to what they`re doing 
 The problems with this film are many but I will try to mention the most glaring and bothersome ones. First of all while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about Manhattan life the reality was that everything as usual in movies and TV was about something bizarre usually of a sexual nature. The story lines were thin or nonexistent and virtually every scene camera shot line of dialog and expressed emotion was absolutely and totally fake. It finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing garbage that I walked out (something no uncommon for me in recent years.) I would have guessed the fi9lm was directed by some wannabe auteur drop outs from some 3rd rate film studies program but I believe the (at one time pre-Amelia talented)director Mira Nair took part in this disgusting travesty so perhaps the directorial talent in America has descended en masse into the cesspool. 
 There are so many comments on this film yet I found them to be misleading. This a corner-cutting over-used scenario where a normal human being becomes a partner in crime to someone of the opposite sex for no apparent reason. Boy meets girl. Girl holds boy up at gunpoint for something ridiculous. Boy is intrigued. You know the drill: The antagonist turns out to be a wild free spirit instead of a sociopath... Toss in a few words of wisdom from Alice Drummond and you have a recipe for Love. Sheedy's 'is she crazy or does she just need a hug?' role from The Breakfast Club simply reeks as a lead character. And all that is left is a truly ghastly turkey of a movie. 
 Well I have to say this movie was so bad that I would have walked out if i didn't have to review it for work. ANd the worst part is I wanted to see it so badly that I drove all over the city paid $10 parking two times because the newspaper listings were wrong. Vince Vaughn plays the guy he always does -- the only time I've seen him play someone else was in that movie with John Travolta. Anyways the plot has potential -- it sounded great in the preview but it is filled with totally ridiculous predictable weak plot turn points. And I was hoping that this would be one Christmas movie where Christmas DIDN t have to be saved and that Santa didn't need a replacdmetn but nope. The only cool part was the sleigh rides and the little bladck kid was the best character. I'm sure this movie would be great for young kids but for adults it's so lame that it's chore to sit through. 
 don't see this. this was one of the dumbest movies i have ever seen. its hard to be Mormon sometimes when there are movies like this out there. what a sad view of Mormon life. i can tell you if you did see this movie that it is not all like this at all in a singles ward. if it was i don't think i would have made it through it. its too bad that most Mormon movies are made by a group of geeks who have nothing better to do. the acting was so bad that my wife and i barely made it through. i guess you could say that it had all the signs of a B movie. or are there C movies? anyway...i just thought this movie sucked and was full of cheese. i wish some Mormons would start making some quality movies. 
 DOC SAVAGE: THE MAN OF BRONZE (1 outta 5 stars) Dreadful dreadful movie... based on the pulp magazine/paperback series by Lester Dent/Kenneth Robeson... about a super-heroic adventure hero in the '30s and his five assistants all experts in some field of endeavor that allows them to combat evil. It was a pretty hokey series... but kinda fun to read when I was a teenager. I knew they made a movie version in the '70s starring Ron (Tarzan) Ely... but I never got a chance to see it. It never played in theaters where I lived and was never shown on TV. Now that I have finally seen the film I can understand why. The plot and characters are never treated seriously... it's all kind of tongue-in-cheek and campy... kind of like the old Batman TV series... only without the benefit of being funny... or having any visual flair. Corny dialogue cheesy special effects dumb stereotypes crummy action scenes and bad bad acting. Actually I find it kind of fascinating in its badness... what could they have possibly been thinking? Arnold Schwarzenegger was rumoured to be starring in a modern-day remake... but I don't imagine that would have turned out to be much better. 
 I really hope that Concorde/New Horizons wasn't trying to make a serious horror or even action movie when they made Carnosaur 3. The movie is flat-out silly from start to finish. Even the humor in C3 is funny because it's bad. Definitely a high water mark in the 'So Bad it's Good' genre. If you enjoy the very worst of the worst this is for you. 
 Eyes of the Werewolf (1999) is a really bad movie. The premise was real good but the overall execution was just terrible. I wished the filmmakers would have taken their time with this project instead of rushing it into production. Some blind dude gets some new eyes bad thing is that they belong to a mean old werewolf. Nasty things begins to happen to the dude as he turns into a cheesy looking creature. Can he find a cure before his hot girlfriend finds out? Who is that weird little troll who helps him out and what's up with that female cop? If you really want to find out check out Eyes of the Werewolf! Not a bad idea for a movie. I just wished the filmmakers would have spent a lot for time in pre-production before they decided to shoot the movie. 
 I hated this crap every Friday as part of tgif it was on and consistently sucked big time with stupidity each and every week. If you want to see something funny go watch No On Would Tell Starring Candice Cameron and Fred Savage it really is hilarious shows exactly why no one ever goes on to a good film career after doing a terrible TV show. This show really makes me sick I hate those kids and bob saget needs to go jump off a bridge for ever making this crapfest. I've seen funner stuff everywhere else but here. I AHet writing 10 lines! Watch 'full house' to see the least humanity has to offer in the way of arts and entertainment. 
 A movie about dealing with the problems with growing up and being true to yourself Blue Juice is mind candy for those who like surfing and Cornwall. Sean Pertwee is the real star of this film while the more famous Catherine Zeta Jones plays his girlfriend and Ewan Mcgregor plays his drug addicted pal. For those who don't like surfing or Cornwall in the slightest you'll find that it takes a long time before the movie even hints at being interesting. The beginning is slow and spends too much time on long shots of only slightly interesting landscapes. Plus too many main characters leads to most of them being one dimensional. The plot is an interesting idea but because of the shallow characters you have no idea why they act in the situations they're put in. Only Ewan Sean and Catherine's characters make this a film worth being on videotape which is why it was only released on videotape in the US after Ewan and Catherine reached mainstream fame. 
 The Wicker Man. I am so angry that I cannot write a proper comment about this movie. The plot was ridiculous thinly tied together and altogether-just lame. Nicolas Cage...shame on you! I assumed that since you were in it that it would be at least decent. It was not. I felt like huge parts of the movie had been left on the cutting room floor and even if it's complete-the movie was just outlandish and silly. At the end you're left mouth agape mind befuddled and good taste offended. I have never heard so many people leave a theater on opening day with so much hatred. People were complaining about it in small groups in the mall four floors down from the theater near the entrance. It's that bad. I heard it compared to : Glitter American Werewolf in Paris and Gigli. My boyfriend was so mad he wouldn't even talk about it. Grrrr! 
 This film is really bad so bad that even Christopher Lee cannot save it.A poor story an even poorer script and just plain bad direction makes this a truly outstanding horror film the outstanding part being that it is the only horror film that i can honestly say i would never ever watch again.This garbage make Plan nine from outerspace look like oscar material. 
 This movie was probably about as silly as The Naked Gun (which was supposed to be). Case in point: 1. In order to fake her drowning Roberts is secretly taking swimming lessons at the YWCA. After her death the YWCA calls her husband at work to give their condolences. HELLO how did they get his work number? 2. Before she leaves town she drops her wedding ring in the toilet. Days or even weeks later her hubby finds it in the John. Does this mean the toilet was never flushed? 3. No explanation is given on how she is paying for her mothers care in the retirement home (since she did it behind her RICH husbands back). 4. Towards the end of this tiresome film Roberts suspects her husband is in the house. Instead of running for her life she runs to the kitchen instead to see if the cans are stacked neatly. 
 Koen Wouters is a flemish singer and presenter. In the early ninety's he tried his hand on movies as well. But this unbelievable piece of junk ended his acting career once and for all. It also ended the acting career of dutch actress Nada van Nie who went on being a football-wife a TV presenter and program-maker. I actually did see this in an ( almost empty) theatre because I used to be a fan of the band of Koen Wouters Clouseau. I so regret spending money on it. It looks cheap it is a terrible story and it is executed bad in every possible way. Some people think it's so bad it's funny. I am not one of them. I just found it an incredible waste of time and money. 
 Lifetime did it again. Can we say stupid? I couldn't wait for it to end. The plot was senseless. The acting was terrible! Especially by the teenagers. The story has been played a thousand times! Are we just desperate to give actors a job? The previews were attractive and I was really looking for a good thriller.Once in awhile lifetime comes up with a good movie this isn't one of them. Unless one has nothing else to do I would avoid this one at all cost. This was a waste of two hours of my life. Can I get them back? I would have rather scraped my face against a brick wall for two hours then soaked it in peroxide. That would have been more entertaining. 
 OK first of all Steve Irwin rest in peace. You were loved by many fans. Now...this movie wasn't a movie at all. It was The Crocodile Hunter TV program with bad acting bad scripts and bad directing in between Steve capturing or teaching us about animals. He was entertaining as an animal seeker/specialist. Millions will miss him. But the whole movie idea was a big mistake. The plot was so broken it was almost non-existent. Casting was horrible. The acting wasn't even worth elementary school-level actors. The direction must be faulted as well. If you can't get a half-way decent performance out of your actors no matter how bad the script is you must not be that good in the first place. I could have written a better script. I wish I had never been to see this movie. Of course I watched it for $3 ($1.50 for me $1.50 for my son.) while out with friends who insisted upon seeing this instead of Scooby Doo Live Action. My son who is not so discriminating liked the movie alright but he still has never asked to see it again. If you want fond memories of Steve Irwin buy his series on DVD. Avoid this movie like the plague. If I were Steve I know I wouldn't want to be remembered for this movie. Respect him: avoid this movie! 
 If you want to know the real story of the Wendigo I suggest you pick up a copy of Algernon Blackwell's original story. This movie was not only bad but had nothing to do with the book. I loved the book when I read it as a kid (In Campfire Chillers by E.M. Freeman)and was so excited to see a movie based on it come out. I was so disappointed when I finally saw it. Another thing is that there were too many PC (Politically Correct) undertones throughout the movie that had no place in the film. When the book was written PC didn't even exist. My suggestion is don't waste your time or money!! If you see it on the video store shelf LEAVE IT THERE. 
 I've just had the evidence that confirmed my suspicions. A bunch of kids 14 to 22 put on the DVD of Titanic on a fantastic state of the art mega screen home entertainment type deal. Only two of them had actually seen it before. But they all had seen the moment of Kate Leo and Celine Dion so many times that most of them felt they had seen the whole movie. Shortly after the epic started they started to get restless some of them left asking the others -- call us when the iceberg appears Over an hour and a half into the movie only the two girls who had seen the movie before were still there. They started shouting: iceberg iceberg. A stampede followed they all came back to see the sinking of the Titanic. They sat open mouthed emitting Ohs and far outs. So just like I thought when the movie first burst into the scene. What is this? One and a half hours waiting for the bloody thing to sink but what about the rest of the of it. Dr. Zivagho for instance had a similar running time but think how much takes place in that film within the same period of time. In Titanic Leo teaches Kate how to spit. Look at the faces and hands of the supposedly creme de la creme in the first class dining room of the ship. Look at the historical details if you can find them. The storyline is so thin that they have to introduce guns and shootings in a ship that is about to sink. The real sinking here is of film standards. All the efforts are focus on special effects and opening week ends. The film went on to become the highest grossing movie of all time so what do I know? 
 *Contains some spoilers* This movie is cheesy 80s horror in all its awfulness. The plot takes way too long to get off the ground never steadies itself and then just plain crashes about 40 minutes into the film. There are a few gem moments for zombie fans but not nearly enough zombies to create a real sense of terror. The zombies also take a long time to make their appearance. First there's a whole half of a movie about mobs and prison gangs. The hero of the movie is an ex-Vietnam vet who gets caught up in the mob. The main mob boss sets him up and he goes to jail. In this jail they are experimenting on the prisoners to find a way to cure them of homicidal tendencies and criminal behavior. But the badie psychotic head scientist/military guy has other plans in mind. He wants to use a slightly different version of the serum to make ....da da da.... super soldiers! After some infected prisoners kill a few guards and most of the prison has a round of infected communion wine the military/crazy scientist guy goes hey this might be a problem and gives a call to the genius scientist turned investigative journalist hot babe ultra-empowered independent woman character who of course invented the original serum. She goes to the prison to see what's going down the military guy calls in a few SWAT teams from his secure position outside the prison and the hero guy takes charge of the few prisoners with a heart of gold when a riot breaks out. The hero guy and the scientist/journalist lady team up to find a cure save the warden's kids and deal with some irate prisoners both infected and not. Meanwhile the mob boss guy has made a deal to get into the prison so that he can save his imprisoned brother. The military gets ready to blow the place up and everyone inside scrambles to find a way out. There are a lot of gory scenes where people are killed by being pressed or pulled through prison bars. There's also a creepy decapitation scene and electrocution scene involving the same infected rasta prisoner. Still the most disturbing scene is in the early part of the film when a gross corrupt guard rapes a prisoner. The main highlight of this film is one scene towards the end. The hero woman and kids are trying to make their way to the only escape route. Their path leads them to a long hallway on one side there is a wall and on the other are prison bars. Hundreds of bloody zombie hands reach through gracing their hair and faces as they pass by. There's also a few good scenes of the classic couple of zombies munching on freshly dead bodies and many zombies ripping one guy to shreds bits. Overall worth watching if you're researching the zombie genre as it has so many zombie clichs worth noting; it's practically an instruction manual on what not to do when making a zombie movie. But if you're new to zombie flicks and want a real scare you should look elsewhere.
