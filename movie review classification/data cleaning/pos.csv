 It was clear right from the beginning that 9/11 would inspire about as many films as World War II and Vietnam combined; however there is certainly a big danger that most of these films to come are about as good (or rather: bad) as Pearl Harbor. It is a great luck that the first international release about 9/11 is not a cheesy love story starring a bunch of pretty faces but a collective work of 11 directors from the entire world. I'm not intending to say that all 11 episodes are great (Youssef Chahine's for example has a needless prologue with too many cuts and Shohei Imamura's has a really bizarre ending) or that the segments are in the right order (Imamura's being the only one not referring directly to the Twin Towers should open the film not end it Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu's should be the last one instead as it's the most impressive one). But it is an impressing effort and an interesting portrayal of the way other parts of the world react to the collapse of the twin towers. Consider Samira Makhmalbaf's opening segment in which an Afghan teachers tries to explain to her pupils what happened in New York and unsuccessfully suggests a one-minute silence. Or Idrissa Ouedraogo's part (which features a bin Laden-double so much resembling the real one that you'll be shocked when you see him I promise) in which 5 boys muse about good things that can be done with the reward put out on Laden. There's a surprisingly good (and extremely angry) segment by Ken Loach about a man from Chile talking about what he calls our Tuesday September 11 - that September 11 in 1973 when their elected president Allende was killed and Pinochet installed his dictatorship - with the generous help from Henry Kissinger and the CIA. This could have become a terrible effort in Anti-Americanism but it did become a sad tale and shares my recognition for the best segment with Inarritu's (mainly sound impressions and phone calls from the hijacked planes to a black screen sometimes a few pictures of people falling down the WTC and finally a collapsing tower ending with the screen brightening up and one question appearing) and Amos Gitai's about a hysterical reporter trying desperatly to get on air after a car bomb exploded in Tel Aviv (hard to recognize but this one is a masterpiece of choreography). All these different segments (I haven't mentioned yet Claude Lelouch's about a deaf girl Danis Tanovic's about a demonstration of the Women of Srebrenica Mira Nair's - strange but it takes an Indian director to make the part that is probably most appealing to Western tastes - about a Muslim family whose son is under a terrible suspicion after 9/11 and Sean Penn's with Ernest Borgnine (yes Ernest Borgnine) as a widower leading the most depressive life one can imagine) add up to a unique film not easy to watch and hard to forget. I am sure this film will be a classic known to everyone thirty years from now. I hope it will be remembered for starting a long tradition of world cinema movies. But alas it's far more probable it will be remembered as a one-film-only effort. And as the one of the few 9/11 movies made by then that don't reduce this terrible event to a love story with a happy end just to please the audience. 
 The most hillarious and funny Brooks movie I ever seen. I can watch and re-watch the tape 100 times. I laugh my a** off and I cry on some moments. It is really good and funny movie and if you like Brooks - this is a must! In short - Brooks (billionare) gets to the streets as homeless for 30 days in order to win the entire poor district from his competitor. The reality bites but in the end - it is about warm relations between humans... Hightly recommend! 
 Along with Fernando Fragata Jo?o M¨¢rio Grilo Abi Feij¨® Leonel Vieira ¨¦tc...(other commercial directors) Diamantino Costa is one of the best Portuguese Directors; O Lampi?o da Estrela was his (Diamantino Costa) First movie before he made several successful commercials. This title is starred by one of the best Portuguese comedians of all times Herman Jos¨¦ and Jos¨¦ Pedro Gomes are great. Its a very funny movie!! (28/07/2000) BOA SORTE DIAMANTINO... 
 The original Vampires (1998) is one of my favorites. I was curious to see how a sequel would work considering they used none of the original characters. I was quite surprised at how this played out. As a rule sequels are never as good as the original with a few exceptions. Though this one was not a great movie the writer did well in keeping the main themes & vampire lore from the first one in tact. Jon Bon Jovi was a drawback initially but he proved to be a half-way decent Slayer. I doubt anyone could top James Wood's performance in the first one though... unless you bring in Buffy! All in all this was a decent watch & I would watch it again. I was left with two questions though... what happened to Jack Crow & how did Derek Bliss come to be a slayer? Guess we'll just have to leave that to imagination. 
 The Matador stars Pierce Brosnan as a burned out assassin. He's James Bond gone to seed in too-tight garish clothes gold chains and an ugly haircut. Our struggling assassin Julian Noble is in Mexico trying to regain his nerve. Staying at the same hotel is a likable down-on-his luck businessman Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) also trying to regain his equilibrium. Danny is desperate to close a deal and return to his wife in Denver (Hope Davis) with good news. Noble and Wright unexpectedly become friends. Wright convinces Noble to reveal certain techniques which he demonstrates at a bullfight. Noble is eventually targeted by his employers and shows up in Denver. Writer and director Richard Shepard did the Q&A after this delightful movie at the Austin Film Festival. Shepard was also down on his luck. After suffering the loss of his agent and rejection of recent scripts he decided to write a story no one would buy and create a character no one would want to play. Then Pierce Brosnan called. Brosnan regains his equilibrium in this movie. (There is life after Bond!) He has a wonderful flair for self-deprecating comedy. Don't miss it. Stay for the closing credits to read what the filmmakers say about bullfighting. I look forward to more of Richard Shepard's projects. 
 Dripping with symbolism and filled with marvelous cinematography Extase is so much more than the erotic drama we've all come to expect. This is almost a silent film with what dialogue there is in German and highly simplified German at that. Perhaps the filmmakers intended the film to reach the widest possible European audience as anyone with even a little high school level Deutsch can easily dispense with the subtitles. The story is of little importance anyway with the film succeeding on a cinematic level not a narrative one. Symbols of fecundity and the power of nature overwhelm the human characters--there are even scenes where flowers obscure the face of supposed star Hedy Lamarr--and there are moments here that will remind viewers of the works of Dreyer Vertov and Riefenstahl. If the film has any message to convey I think it's a political one: bourgeois man is timid and impotent; working class man is a happy productive creature; and woman is the creator destined to be unfulfilled until she has borne a child. This blend of Soviet socialist realism and National Socialist dogma doesn't overwhelm the film by any means--it's a beauty to watch from beginning to end--but it does place it in a very distinct artistic era. And oh yeah Hedy does get her kit off. 
 The anime that got me hooked on anime... Set in the year 2010 (hey that's not too far away now!) the Earth is now poison gas wasteland of pollution and violence. Seeing as how crimes are happening ever 30 seconds are so and committed by thieves who have the fire power of third world terrorists the government of the fictional New Port City form the Tank Police to deal with the problem - cops with tanks! Oh the insanity! The heroes of this series include the new recruit Leona Ozaki a red haired Japanese woman (yeah I know they never match their distinctly Japanese names with a Japanese appearance) who has just been drafted into the Tank Police and is quickly partnered with blond blue eyed nice guy Al. Leona is new at using tanks and unfortunately she destroys the favorite tank of Tank Police Commander Charles Britain (also known as Brenten ) a big guy who looks like Tom Selleck on steroids and sporting a pair of nifty sunglasses a big revolver and a bad temper. Britain didn't like having Leona join the Tank Police in the first place and her wrecking his Tiger Special (a giant green monster tank) doesn't exactly endear her to him nor is he fond of her taking the remains of his giant tank and using it to build a mini-tank that she nicknames Bonaparte and he is soon pushing to have her transferred to child welfare where the boys are more your size as he puts it. There's also Specs the bifocal genius Bible quoting/God fearing Chaplain purple MO-hawked Mohican and the pot bellied Chief who's right on the edge thanks to the Mayor always yelling at him about the Tank Police antics. Seeing as how the tank cops often destroy half the city while chasing the bad guys and use extreme violence to capture them they're not very well liked by the people. The villains are a cyborg named Buaku who's got a mysterious past that's connected with a project known as Green Peace his gang and his two sexy cat cyborg sidekicks Anna & Uni Puma. In the first installment these guys are being paid to steal urine samples from a hospital treating people who haven't been infected by the poison gas clouds and in the 2nd they're hired to steal a painting that is of a naked Buaku. The story however was uncompleted in the anime and was finished up in a cult comic ( Manga ) book that's very hard to find. All sorts of chaos and mayhem ensue in this black comic venture that examines how far people want their police to go in order to catch criminals and what happens when the fine line between good guys and bad guys starts to get blurred. This is the kind of thing that if you were going to make a movie of it you'd better go get Quentin Tarantino. Uneven in places but still a lot of fun. Followed by New Dominion: Tank Police . 
 I watched this film sort of by accident having bought it as the B side on The Omega Man DVD. The Omega Man was a bit of a disappointment - except for the beginning which was clearly the inspiration for 28 Days Later the rest of it is just the stuff of TV movies. But Soylent Green is in a whole other league. I bet this is one of Tarantino's favourites. There are at least 3 scenes in the film that I've never seen anything like before. Heston casually getting into bed with the furniture while discussing something else completely unrelated! A whole crowd of people being scooped up by a fleet of mechanical diggers! A priest taking confession and being shot by the confessor. Ok maybe that's been done since - but there aren't many films that are so consistently original like this. And what the heck is going on between Heston and Edward G. Robinson? Is this the most unlikely gay couple ever or what? Luckily I saw this film without knowing the ending - which apparently is rare. Then I watched it again and enjoyed all the little clues that make the long early scenes worthwhile. A very nice script - and some great sets too. Just when you thought you'd seen everything . . . 
 Bonanza had a great cast of wonderful actors. Lorne Greene Pernell Whitaker Michael Landon Dan Blocker and even Guy Williams (as the cousin who was brought in for several episodes during 1964 to replace Adam when he was leaving the series). The cast had chemistry and they seemed to genuinely like each other. That made many of their weakest stories work a lot better than they should have. It also made many of their best stories into great western drama. Like any show that was shooting over thirty episodes every season there are bound to be some weak ones. However most of the time each episode had an interesting story some kind of conflict and a resolution that usually did not include violence. While Bonanza was a western the gunfighting was never featured as the main attraction. While I am a fan of The Rifleman and Wanted: Dead Or Alive; those shows usually ended with a gunfight. Gunfights were how many westerns resolved every conflict and Bonanza was very different in trying to seek peaceful resolutions and harmony instead of killing. In the early years of Bonanza there are some interesting episodes that do feature a lot of gunfights. Those episodes stand in contrast to the rest of the series but they are pretty good in and of themselves. In 1964 when Pernell Whitaker wanted to leave the show Guy Williams was brought in to replace him. Williams was playing the role of a long-lost cousin. Unfortunately Whitaker decided to stay one more year and thus Williams was written out of the series when he moved away to marry Adam's old girlfriend. If Williams had stayed on for the duration of Bonanza one can only wonder how much better the series would have been in the years after 1965 when Pernell Whitaker left the show. Undoubtedly once Pernell Whitaker left the series the stories focused more on comedy and country hijinks. Whitaker had often played the heavy in many episodes and his absence left a void in the cast. Little Joe always wanted to play the nice kid and Hoss always wanted to play the good old boy with a heart of gold. Since Ben was the kind and wise patriarch of the family that did not leave too much room for any gunfights. At some point they hired a ranch hand called Candy (David Canary) who became their fourth member of the cast but Candy was never featured in any gunfights and he was hardly more than an older version of Little Joe. For a year or two they also had Ben take in some other lost cousin (Jamie played by the forgettable Mitch Vogel) who was a teenager that was usually getting into some kind of trouble with someone. Apparently by adding the teenager the studio was looking to attract younger viewers. It also gave the writers a chance to write episodes about teenage problems alcohol delinquency etc. Those kind of preachy episodes were popular in the 1960s as a reaction of the establishment media to the counter-culture movement. Dragnet was probably the most popular source of law and order TV though Hawaii 5-0 The F.B.I. and many other shows also tried to jump on the bandwagon by doing TV shows that featured irresponsible teenagers causing mischief mayhem and crime. The addition of a teenager to the cast gave the Cartwrights more chances to show up and solve problems but those episodes feel very contrived and are not very good in general. After Dan Blocker died the series limped along for another year or so before it was canceled. The last season was pretty bad as it featured Little Joe tracking down the killers of his wife and most of the episodes were somewhat depressing because Little Joe was usually drinking or otherwise remembering how much he loved his wife and how unfair it was that she was killed. I don't think I have ever seen the last episode of the series and I wonder if they ever officially wrapped it up in some way. By the last year there was only Ben (Lorne Greene) actually living on the Ponderosa as Adam had moved away (and never came back even once as a guest) and Hoss had died and Little Joe had left after his wife (in the series) had been killed by drifters. Overall the era from 1959-1965 is the best of this series. Once Adam left it slowly declined. Most of the shows before 1970 are pretty good too. By 1970 the series was trying to hard to be hip and topical and it had lost a lot of its western flavor. The addition of Candy and the teenage kid also diluted the general quality of the show and the death of Hoss (Dan Blocker) was the final nail. Bonanza is probably the best western series ever made and of the 465 episodes that were produced at least one hundred of them are excellent western drama! That is a pretty good record. Even the worst of Bonanza is better than a lot of other TV shows. 
 A famous orchestra conductor Daniel Dareus suffers what appears a heart attack as he finished conducting a concert. Suddenly we watch him as he arrives in the small town that he has left years before. Since he left so young and having his name changed contributes to give him a new persona. He has bought the old school building where he plans to stay. The building needs a lot of work. One would expect a man in his position to have all the comforts of the world he left behind to be installed in his new abode but no Daniel puts up with the harsh winter in his own way. The local pastor Stig whose church has a small choir comes calling to see if he can interest Daniel in helping but the conductor has no desire to go back to music. Daniel begins to explore his new universe. The town's people leave him alone. He makes an impression on Lena who works in the local store where he goes to get his food supplies. Little by little he comes around and decides to involve himself with the choir. Lena will ultimately fall in love with Daniel. At first the relationship between Daniel and the choir members is not exactly what he expected. As they get to know him better they come around to accept him and make him one of them. His new position doesn't endear him to the woman who used to be in charge. The members of the choir are a motley crew but they realize the change Daniel has made in the way they interpret different songs. The new piece composed for Gabriella a battered wife makes a great impact in her life and that of her fellow singers. Daniel's ideas for the repertoire clash with Stig's own. The vicar suddenly begins seeing Daniel in a new light; he is a tormented man who likes to read pornographic magazines before making love to his wife Siv. His ideas clash with the dogma as Siv points to him. Stig decides to try to put a stop to what he considers an unhealthy influence of Daniel by firing him as the head of the choir. The choir which has been invited to participate in a competition travels to Austria. Daniel who by now has fallen totally for Lena has a chance to show for the first time in his life his feelings for her when she starts to gets doubts about their relationship. Daniel who is late for his own concert gets to hear them making extraordinary music even though he is not in among them. Kay Pollak the director of this enormously appealing film shows he was the man to direct it. The story involves the viewer from the start. Great part of the success of the movie goes to the ensemble cast that was put together. William Nykvist who plays the leading role is the best excuse for watching the film. Frida Hallgren Niklas Falk Ylva Loof do excellent work for Mr. Pollak. Stefan Nilsson is the composer for most of the beautiful music one hears. Harald Gunnar Paalgard's cinematography makes the film look better capturing different seasons for the viewer in their beauty. 
 Talk about a blast opening Trampa Infernal has the coolest opening credits ever! Guided by musical tones that are perhaps slightly inspired by the legendary Friday the 13th theme (Tsh-Tsh-Tsh-Ha-Ha-Ha) the names of the lead players appear on screen split up in giant syllables. Promising intro of a totally obscure Mexican slasher/backwoods survival thriller and it only becomes cooler with every minute that passes. Two extremely competitive and testosterone-overloaded paintball enemies challenge each other to the ultimate showdown in a sleazy bar. According to a newspaper article there's a savage bear loose in the nearby woods and it already killed multiple of the hunters that tried to catch it. The challenge includes that whoever kills the bear will be declared the ultimate macho hero with the biggest set of balls. Upon arrival however it quickly becomes obvious they're not up against a bear but a bewildered and utterly maniacal war veteran with quite an arsenal of weapons in his hideout and numerous combat tricks up his sleeve. After a whole decade of tame and derivative American slashers this early 90's Mexican effort looks and feels very refreshing and vivid. The formula is simplistic but efficient the lead characters are plausible enough and the building up towards the confrontations with the sadist killer is reasonably suspenseful. The maniac must have been a fan of Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers as he also uses a self-made glove with sharp knives attached to it and a white mask to cover his face. The murders are pleasingly nasty and barbaric which I was really hoping for since the awesome aforementioned opening sequences and waste a whole lot of gratuitous blood. The forestry setting and particularly the camouflaged booby traps are joyously spectacular. Trampa Internal is a Mexican slasher/survival sleeper hit that comes warmly recommended to the fans of the genre. 
 Was flipping around the TV and HBO was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions so I turned to my twin sister and said Hey this looks like fun - truly I love documentaries - so we started watching it. At first I thought Jonni Kennedy was a young man but then it was explained that due to his condition he never went through puberty thus the high voice and smaller body. He was on a crusade to raise money for his cause. He had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality... I cried watched some more laughed got up to get another Kleenex then cried some more. Once Jonni Kennedy's time was up he flew to heaven to be with the angels. He was more than ready; he had learned his lessons from this life and he was free. I highly recommend this. If you do not fall in love with this guy you have no heart. 
 Okay that was a pretty damn good episode. Much better than the credit it receives. The camera work is splendid. Best yet. I love that final shot. The atmosphere is fantastic the costumes are great and the guest cast (minus the helpless victims) is strong. What I don't like about this episode is that many things that are left unexplained. why does it change sex? what's the purpose? and they're aliens? what kind? why were they never shown again in the later mythology? I'm giving this episode a high THREE stars. One of my favorites yet but the plot holes bother me. Still... not gonna let it ruin my entertainment. 
 The first episode immediately gave a good impression what to expect from the series! Mysteries waiting to be solved and a lot of good drama! I love the fact that they gradually reveal the stories concerning the characters! Explaining just enough to stay excited! Of course this show has some flaws! In the first two series there are some characters who for some reason don't show up in the third season! Many of the characters have a decent sent off but some of them just aren't there! Like Rose and her husband! Where the hell are they? What happened to them? Maybe they will return in later episodes! But it is a little inconsistent! That being said Lost manages to be thrilling every episode(especially the first two seasons)! That is a very hard thing to do! I do notice that in the third season the focus is more on character development than the mystery aspects of the show! This is not a bad thing! It even saves some episodes from getting boring! One of the elements that can be considered the strength of this show are the wonderful characters! You will grow to love these characters! Good or bad! But eventually I will want to see some mysteries to be solved and get closure! The danger of Lost getting canceled due to declining ratings is near! And that would be devastating! 
 I got this film about a month ago and I am now a fanatic fan of Drew Barrymore's. I love a happy ending and this film gives a brilliant one with the truths of Red Sox slotted in! It's about a maths teacher who takes some promising kids on a maths trip to a company where the successful Lindsey(Drew) shows them some information. This then leads in the Ben(teacher) and Lindsey dating. But it isn't all simple when he confesses he is a massive Red Sox fan. First of all things are fine but then his baseball gets in the way of Lindseys life. It's all fine in the end and It took one shot to get Drew running across the field!! I got it for two quid in Blockbusters so I was happy. If you like films like this I suggest you see some more of Drew's work like Charlie's Angels and 50 first dates or even her new film with Hugh Grant in called Music and Lyrics. 
 In Rosenstrasse Margarethe von Trotta blends two stories to create a vibrant tapestry of love and courage. The film depicts a family drama of estrangement between a mother and her daughter and the story of German women who staged a protest on Rosenstrasse to free their Jewish husbands from certain extermination. In addition to the dramatization of historical events the focus of the film is on the saving of a child from the Holocaust by a German and the result of the child's experience of losing her mother. While Ms. von Trotta shows that the courage of a small number of Germans made a difference she does not use it to excuse German society. Indeed she shows how in the midst of torture and extermination the wealthy artists and intellectuals of German high society went on about their lives and parties oblivious to the suffering. Rosenstrasse opens in New York as a Jewish widow Ruth Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) decides to sit Shiva a seven-day period of mourning that takes place following a funeral in which Jewish family members devote full attention to remembering and mourning the deceased. When her daughter Hannah (Maria Schrader) is forbidden to receive phone calls from her fianc¨¦ Luis (Fedja van Huet) a non-Jew Hannah questions why her mother has suddenly decided to follow an Orthodox tradition that she previously rejected. When Ruth coldly rejects her cousin Hannah questions her and learns about a woman named Lena who took Ruth in as a child when the latter's mother was deported and murdered by the Nazis and she vows to find Lena and discover the secret of her mother's past. Her quest takes her to Berlin where she finds Lena (Doris Schade) now ninety years old and interviews her on the pretext that she is a journalist researching certain aspects of the Holocaust. With unfailing memory Lena tells her story of how as a young 33-year old woman (Katja Reimann) she searched for her husband Jewish pianist Fabian Israel Fischer (Martin Feifel) who disappeared and was presumed to have been imprisoned despite the protection normally given Jews in mixed marriages. Lena in a radiant performance by Reimann discovers that her husband and other Jews are being held prisoner in a former factory on the Rosenstrasse. Standing together in the freezing night German women whose husband are missing congregate outside the building their numbers growing daily until they reach one thousand shouting Give us back our husbands . Lena finds Ruth (Svea Lohde) a young girl whose mother is in the building. She takes care of her protecting her from the Gestapo and raising her after her mother is killed. Lena comes from an aristocratic German family and her brother recently returned from Stalingrad is a Wehrmacht officer. After being refused help from her father to free Fabian she enlists the aid of her brother who tells a fellow Officer I know what they do to the Jews. I saw it . Given his support she is bold enough to bypass channels and go to the top where her beauty and charm prove irresistible for the Minister of Culture Joseph Goebbels a known womanizer. While this fictional part of the film has been criticized as degrading to the women protesters it is a historical fact that Goebbels was very active in making the decisions affecting Rosenstrasse. The director Margarethe von Trotta an activist feminist and intellectual is no stranger to political drama. She directed a film about Socialist Rosa Luxembourg and Marianne and Julianne a story of the relationship between two sisters one of whom resorts to political violence to accomplish her liberal objectives. In Rosenstrasse a film she worked on for eight years she had to make compromises adding the present day fictional element in order to have her film produced. That it works so well is a tribute to Ms. von Trotta's artistry and the beautiful screenplay by Pamela Katz whose father was a refugee from Leipzig. The events at Rosenstrasse give the lie to Germans who say there was nothing we could do . Now von Trotta has shown the opposite to be true that something could be done to resist the Nazis. It is tragic that the example did not catch on. 
 I don't know why people always want deeper meaning in movies or else consider them worthless. What about just being entertained? Something at which Morgan Freeman excels. He gets a chance to show off a bit. Paz Vega his co-star gets a career boost and Brad Silberling gets a name to draw people into watching his movie. I thought it was a good movie. Some humor some pathos some bittersweetness but nothing over the top. I got an especial kick out of Jim Parsons as the receptionist at a construction company. When he looks at Freeman adoringly and says You make me want to be a woman. He's just hilarious. The fight scene between Ms. Vega her ex-husband and his girlfriend is wonderful too. In short it's a cute charming film that will make you smile. You could do much much worse. 
 Most of the comments have been positive but I would like to add that viewers should also focus on the sets. The set designer used a lot of beautiful art deco treatments along with beautiful buildings stairs doors furniture and so forth. It is worth paying attention to. The movie is driven by characterization and symbolism which is very rich. All the gangster actors were cast - it was like seeing old friends and it was a treat. The dialog was amusing at times but stilted at times and I suppose it was meant to be that way. This is a film buff's film. It was made by people for people who love the medium. Don't miss this one. 
 What a good movie! At last a picture revealing a unknown side of rock: illusions of fame. Well-known Rockers are getting old and forgotten not the music. And with a good sense of humour. Have you ever danced on Bill Haley's Rock Around the Clock? Anyway Still Crazy is probably the best movie about rock n'roll I have ever seen. Far much better than Spinal Tap for instance. Why? Because in Still Crazy people are mature. They have a different point of view about rock about love and about life. They want to catch up with their crazy youth they miss so much. Beyond the story itself we see characters with their own personality weaknesses and dreams. Like anyone of us. Spend a good time watching this (listen to the awesome soundtrack! )and finally thinking of your own future. Bye! 
 May and her husband go to visit their children and grandchildren. The visit is awkward because the grandchildren and kids don't really seem to know each other as one might expect. The warmth that should be there is missing. After dinner May's husband says he doesn't feel well blames it on his daughter's cooking and irritably says he wants to go home. He dies that night. May now a widow is lost. She clearly did not have a passionate marriage or a very interesting one but she had a purpose. She had someone who needed her and even though her own needs had gone unmet for years she had something to do with her days. She is depressed and unmotivated. She goes to stay with her daughter Paula who shortly after her mother's arrival lets her mother know that she has never felt that her mother has given much of herself at all. She lets loose with anger over her mother's lack of nurturing. May seems disarmed and surprised yet she also doesn't seem to have the energy or the desire to really make it right. I'm your mother and I love you. What does really say? (I've heard this from my own mother way too many times and have yet to figure out what it means.) Paula is a bit (well more than a bit) neurotic. Both women are needy though they show it very differently. Paula has been involved with a friend of her son's Darren who is a handyman working on the house owned by her son. While Paula is working during the day May begins to have conversations and lunches with Darren. Darren is a married man who has stayed with his wife because of their autistic son Nicky but supposedly doesn't live in the home with his wife. May becomes attracted to Darren because he is virile and she enjoys the connection they seem to have. Darren becomes attracted to May because she offers a kind of peace and understanding that he does not get from the other women in his life. (He also becomes too interested in money that May says she can give him to get away from it all though he is clearly not interested in her desire to join him on such a journey. They end up sleeping together in the spare room during the day and May enjoys fulfillment as a woman that she has not known in years nor had ever expected to know again. As her daughter Paula had often told her that she would leave the married Darren this becomes part of May's rationalization that what she is doing is okay. At a writing group that Paula leads May is introduced rather forced to get together with a widower to whom she is not attracted. There is one scene where she has sex with the older man who clearly can barely perform and it truly painful and unsettling as we see the total disgust on May's face as she endures the one-time ghastly liaison. Eventually Paula discovers through some very graphic sketches done by her mother that indeed her mother and Darren have been having sex. This film will undoubtedly be seen by many in myriad ways. Sympathies will be divided. At one point during Paula's writing group May reveals through a short essay that she used to feel as though she hated her kids by the end of the day and would leave for pubs after they were asleep making sure to get back home before her husband. Clearly a good mother does not think of leaving children alone while she goes off to the local pub. May however also had revealed earlier in the film that her husband didn't like her having any friends so she didn't have any. She did what he wanted her to do. She was miserable but she put up with it because as she said it was easier. So while May was not the best mother for those inclined to have any sympathy for her one might see May's actions as the act of a woman just wanting to be sexual and to be a live for a few minutes in her lifetime. A woman who just wanted someone to listen to her to know her as a human being to have a friend and a lover. Paula though neurotic and unhappy perhaps has become that way because of the distant parents who raised her. Certainly it is not difficult to understand why Paula feels completely betrayed by her mother. It is a well-done film with more complexities than I have mentioned and certainly one that will leave the viewer with many perhaps conflicting reactions. It is a film worth discussing and debating and above all worth seeing. One thing the film leaves us with is the horror and fear of a lonely life. No matter who is deemed right or who is deemed 'wrong by each viewer that theme of old age and loneliness evoking a sense of dread in most of us is inescapable. 
 For Columbo fans such as myself this is the episode of episodes that made a case for why Columbo was so popular and just how good it really was. Ruth Gordon has a field day (as ever) playing the wittily intelligent crime novelist Abigail Mitchell. Seems Abigail calls her nephew-in-law to sign some papers making him her heir. She never got over her niece's death and is convinced her dead niece's husband (Charles Frank) did the dirty deed. To tell more would be unthinkable. Mariette Hartley has a sly role as Abigail's personal assistant. This episode of Columbo is in a class by itself. It's a truly well made television movie. I recommend it most highly. 
 This movie is incredible. If you have the chance watch it. Although a warning you'll cry your eyes out. I do every time I see it and I own it and have watched it many times. The performances are outstanding. It deals with darkness and pain and loss but there is hope. This movie made me look at the world differently: vicarious experience according to my English teacher. Also if you've seen it note the interesting use of shadows and light. Home room is a phenomenal movie and I rate it 10/10 - for real - because of the excellent acting amazing plot and heart-wrenching dialogue. Very tense very moving. Doesn't give all the answers but makes many good points about humankind 
 This is a very enjoyable film with excellent actors and actresses evoking a range of emotions. It contains some really excellent humour which the whole family can enjoy. You get to know the characters quickly and experience their ups and downs. And it ends very upbeat 
 This is one of the best ensemble comedy/musical B film's that I have seen (and since I'm in my 40's now and only seeing this now I am not an expert but I have seen all the well known films out there). When there are a ton of actors getting their lead for minutes at a time usually the comedy interferes with the musical bits and very often the musical pieces interrupt the comedic flow. Call me in a crazy kind of mood but when I saw this on TCM Europe I was laughing out loud with pleasure! So who delivered the laughs for me? Without a doubt Mischa Auer delivered me some terrific gut busting laughs he even steals the ending it was great! Speaking of which I think why this movie works is because although L & H are a selling point (and why I got hooked to watch this one (them and Hal Roach) I love them in their early Hal Roach stuff) this keeps them at a minimum and stays squarely on ADULT fare (by 1930's standards and not that far from today's standards if you read between the lines). Jack Haley is also great to watch I admit that I only know him from W O OZ and I loved him there and I also laughed out loud here at his waiter bit in the show. Patsy Kelly is the only ugly femme in the 30's movies that actually turns me on (something tells me she was a spitfire in real life); and the musical numbers have a real professional production (Busby Berkley'ish) quality that blew me away from what I am used to in this genre. I could go on and on but rest assured I really enjoyed this movie. 8 of 10 I saw it on TCM Europe and will record it to watch again with my wife on TCM USA. Good Stuff! 
 'The Last Wave' is far more than the sum of its parts. It's not merely a disaster film not simply an exploration into Australian Aboriginal spirituality and certainly more than a simple court drama. Writer/Director Peter Weir manages to take these elements to the next level to produce a truly effective and thought-provoking film with the same eerie atmosphere he gave to 'Picnic At Hanging Rock' two years earlier that you will continue to remember years later. When lawyer David Burton (Chamberlain) is called to defend Chris Lee (Gulpilil) over the death of an Aboriginal for which he may or may not be directly responsible he finds himself not merely struggling to get the truth from Lee but making sense of what he hears when it does come. As with the Aboriginal belief that there are two worlds - the everyday and the Dreamtime the truth exists on two completely different levels with ramifications more disastrous than Burton could ever have imagined. No doubt the reason why 'Picnic At Hanging Rock' is better remembered is because of its enduring mystery. We are led along the same path but forced to find answers for ourselves. In 'The Last Wave' we can piece everything together by the end of the film. However even with all the information we have to choose how much of it we want to believe because the film takes us beyond the borders of our normal realities. On the production side Weir uses his budget to great effect progressively building a sense of doom in everything from soft lighting to heavy rain to good use of sound. The incidental music is unobtrusive never trying to be grandiose. Richard Chamberlain manages to convey the bafflement the audience would doubtless feel as he tries to unravel the mystery. David Gulpilil excellently portrays a man trapped between two worlds wanting to do the right thing but afraid because he already knows the ending. Put all these things together and you have a perfect example of why David Weir is a familiar name in cinema thirty years on. Strongly recommended. 
 My wife Kate and I absolutely loved the series and can't wait for the next one (hopefully there is a sequel!). I would love to know what the catchy song is called and who wrote it maybe because I am old and grey and still interested in life:-). If anyone has the full lyrics please send them. Of course one big reason why my wife and I liked this series so much was that we are 75 years old and retired but still very active intellectually. It's great to see a show that highlights the contribution to society that can still be made by older people with special skills and experience. The human interest aspect showing the interactions of the characters and the younger people around them is an important part of the show. This series is highly entertaining and very sophisticated on a par with some of our other favourites Spooks and Hustle . 
 When I saw the film for the first time in the early 1970s I was in awe of this film. Visually it was stunning and the events on campuses in Europe and USA made you relate with what Antonioni was trying to say so well visually in the final 15 minutes of the movie: blowing up in your mind the tyrannical establishments and big business interests. The repeated blowing up of the beautiful house in the middle of a desert the lead female character enjoying the natural stream of cold water painting a plane in psychedelic designs (even the staid British Airways did it a few years ago) are some of the images that were copied by advertising personnel all over the world for decades. Even Pink Floyd increased their fan following after the film was released. You see this film some 30 years later and you begin to wonder why the same film has lost its appeal. Today anti-establishment films have more substance--facts documentation fine performances and superb screenplays. Antonioni seems to be out-of-date; a flawed genius. Even viewing Antonioni's Blow Up today gives you the similar feeling that he is passe. Zabriski Point has to be evaluated for what it was when it was released. It was a great film if you were to see it on a wide Panavision screen as opposed to the dwarfed TV screens. The visual and aural (Mick Jagger Kieth Richards Pink Floyd et al.) allure of the film still remains. The lead pair were not great actors but they were cute and natural. One of them (Mark Frechette) died in prison in USA extending the reality of the non-conformist values he personified in the film. Today Antonioni seems out of sync. But watch carefully and you will appreciate the muted sounds of the regular actors--Rod Taylor G.D. Spradling the ladies at the swimming pool the cops at the air-strip. The real sounds in contrast are from the non-conformists. Antonioni was relevant 30 years ago but his grasp of the medium cannot be questioned even today. He knew what he was doing. 
 This is a gory mess and pretty convincing. Corbin Bernson is very much in command of this movie with his slick portrayal of the loony control freak eponymous practitioner. Linda Hoffman plays his cheating wife and she is very easy on the eye - unfortunately for her the little tryst with the pool guy brings severe punishment in a way the good doctor knows best - shame about that pretty smile! The last half hour of the movie is devoted to Bernson's character losing it completely and the spotlight falls on a young actress called Virginya Keehne. An extremely talented performer she hogs the limelight from the moment the braces come off. Nice legs too! 
 This has to be one of the best movies to come out of HK in a long time i was eagerly waiting to get my hands on this movie just looking at the title. Loads of fantastic actors in this show and i was particularly impressed with Sam Lee's impossibly believable insane behavior and Edison's portrayal of a killer machine which totally reversed his normal idol image. i would definitely recommend to those looking for a stylish and action packed movie. However i must warn you this is also an equally depressing movie as every character in the movie is in some kind of dead end and trouble of their own and struggling to breathe. Makes you think about what is life about really. 
 Principally it is the story of two men who were part of the Portuguese revolution. It was easy to understand the contest but usually directors starts from a historical fact to speak about something else or they shows also the period before or after this fact here everything happen during that couple of days when the revolution acts. It could also be seen as a kind of documentary. The movie focalize to these two people showing as normal they were not like common heroes because the revolution come from people. Although it was made from military army from the title you can understand that they were just capitaes as the main characters. Nice colors and lights during the whole movie excellent work for the director being her first movie she doesn't fall to the banal way. Well shown emotions and passion of people and crowd. The character of Maia (main one)is well-made and there is also a good interpretation for Stefano Accorsi able to show Maia's limits this not-being an hero. 
 My son was 7 years old when he saw this movie he is now on a Russian Fishing vessel and said that the movie he was most impressed with and that has lingered in his mind all of these 39 years is the movie of The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle. He has asked if it were possible for me to get this for him. I am sure that a lot of things go through his head as he has only 3 hours of daylight and he has been on this ship for 3 months and will have 3 more months before his contract expires. Since we have Indian blood he connects to this movie. On January 27th he will turn 47 years old and I would like to be able to obtain this movie for him. He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the past 17 years and as we all know this is one of the most dangerous jobs. Can you help me obtain this movie? Thanking you in advance Dolly Crout-Soto Deerfield Beach FL 
 I wish that '70s show would come back on television. It was the greatest show ever!!! They should make episodes between the other episodes but of course that would be confusing. But I wish it would come back and make more episodes. Please come back... The show was absolutely hilarious. You couldn't laugh without seeing an episode. There is a really funny part in every episode and plus the show was so much better when Hyde and Jackie were going out with each other. Those were the best episodes. That '70s show is the best .... It will be and always will be the best show ever. It was really sad when the show ended. They should make new episodes. 
 As I reach the backside of 35 I find myself shaking my head more and more at the sex crazed drug influenced teens of today. It was great to be reminded that it was just as crazy for me back in my day as it is for teens today. This film drives that point home to the core. If you are a late 70's fan you'll love the film. From KISS-posters to an Angel concert this movie rocks ! Watch for a young Laura Dern. Why they didn't have more songs from the Runaways I'll never know ? I did have a problem with Randy Quaid's character deflowering a 16 year old girl. While he was away she and her friends have a party that destroys dude's house. The cops come and everything but no mention of all the underage drinking and how these kids got their hands on this stuff. Foxes belongs right there with Over the Edge Fast Times Dazed & Confused and Kids as one of the all time teen angst flicks. I say buy it and watch it with your kids and talk about it all. 
 ABC has done more for this show by allowing television veterans James Garner and David Spade to join the cast of this show. At first the show was watchable and even predictable with John Ritter and Katey Sagal. John's loss shocked the world. Katey and the three kids are really a solid professional cast. The hour lesson after John's death in real-life struck home to me. I lost my father at 17 years old and could sympathize and understand their pain and agony. ABC should be proud to maintain this show and even preserve this as John's final wish. This show has matured and developed because of such impossible circumstances. They should be rewarded with Emmys. 
 Cheech & Chong's Next Movie (1980) was the second film to star to pot loving duo of Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong. The lovable burn out smokers are now roommates. They live in a condemned building looking for ways to score more smoke and just lay about all day. But Cheech is the responsible one. He has a job and a steady girlfriend. One day Cheech wants to get his freak on so he tries to get Chong out of the house. Another problem arises as well Cheech's brother Red (Cheech is another role) is in town and wants to hang with him. Firguring that he could kill two birds with one stone Cheech pawns Chong off and Red. What kind of adventures will Chong and Red get into? Will Cheech get his freak on? How long will Chong go without some smoke? Just watch CHEECH & CHONG'S NEXT MOVIE to find out!! Tommy Chong takes over the directorial reigns for the sequel. He received some experience when he did some uncredited work on UP IN SMOKE. Funny but not as good as the first film. But Cheech and Chong fans will enjoy it. Followed by NICE DREAMS. Recommended. 
 This is a very unusual film in that the star with the top billing doesn't appear literally until half way in. Nevertheless I was engaged by the hook of the Phantom Lady. Curtis though competent as the falsely accused Scott Henderson looks a little tough to be be sympathetic towards (perhaps he should have shaved his moustache) and his behavior when he first comes home should have convinced the cops at least to some degree of his innocence. While another commentator had a problem with Franchot Tone as Jack Marlowe I found his portrayal of the character to be impressively complex. He is no stock villain. Superb character actor Elisha Cook Jr. is again in top form as the 'little man with big ambitions.' His drumming in the musical numbers added a welcome touch of eroticism. This movie however is carried by the very capable and comely Ella Raines as the devoted would be lover of Henderson Carol Richmond. She definitely has talent and her screen presence is in the tradition of Lauren Bacall. This is the first of her work I have seen and I am definitely inclined to see her other roles. The rest of the supporting cast is also more than competent. All in all a very satisfying film noir mystery which when viewed today fully conveys the dark and complex urban world it is intended to. Recommended 8/10. 
 As drunken millionaire playboy Arthur Bach Dudley Moore is perfect as a grown man trapped in childhood. As it turned out the role fit Moore so perfectly it trapped him as an actor as well. Many disappointments soon followed (including this film's pale sequel) yet that doesn't diminish the charm or appeal of this picture which is cleverly written and directed. Some of Moore's drunk scenes are forced parts of the film are wobbly but the cast performs with so much relish it's a difficult movie to resist. It has a very big heart and gives Oscar-winner John Gielgud a sly dryly amusing role as Arthur's valet Hobson; his relationship with Arthur is delicious and they have a miraculous rapport. Liza Minnelli (as a blue-collar love-interest) is sassy in a low-key and Moore is brash but deft and lively; he never shook off the shadow of Arthur but at least we have this document of a career high-point to cherish. *** from **** 
 I had low expectations for this movie but I was looking for something unchallenging for an evening. I walked out of the theatre totally delighted and somewhat surprised. This is a very fine baseball tribute film and a nice lesson about pursuing your dreams. Dennis Quaid does a masterful job with his role and I was touched by his performance. Definitely worth a full price ticket and a couple hours of your time! 
 This movie was beautiful. It was full of memorable imagery good acting and touching subject matter. It would be very easy to write it off as being too sentimental but that is the sentiments this type of a movie is trying to achieve. I was totally involved in the story's unfolding and presentation. There were a few cheesy shots but such is to be expected in a religious propaganda film. The only complaint I can conjure is there wasn't a ton of details. However this movie wasn't created to explain every element of Joseph Smith's life ministry triumphs controversies failures etc.; it was designed for a quick glimpse at a few highlights of one of the most amazing American and historical religious figures of all time. 
 Before seeing this I was merely expecting another mediocre soft core copy of the much imitated Emmanuelle series starring Sylvia Kristel. It was really surprising how good this one turned out to be. It actually has a story and it is very romantic indeed. What makes 'Yellow Emanuelle' so good is it's leading heroine the beautiful and exotic Chai Lee. She plays her character Emy Wong so sweetly that the viewer just has to feel something for her when her dreams crash down around her. Emy Wong is a much-respected doctor statuesque with a regal quality. She comes from an important old family where ancient customs are still practiced. Emy will remain a virgin until she is married to a man she has never met. The beautiful doctor seems OK with this arranged marriage. It is simply how it is done in her world. However she does not plan on meeting and falling in love with the British pilot who ends up under her care in the hospital where she works. Emy decides to do away with custom and she gives herself to her Western man. But only after a very long courtship as Doctor Wong is anything but an easy woman. Her pilot George is a good guy and promises to marry Emy so that she doesn't lose her respectability and place in her rigid society. Neither one counts on a third party one Ilona Staller who destroys their relationship through a series of vicious games. Emy is made to believe that she has been abandoned by her man that he only played a game with her in order to sleep with her. Her place in society is gone she has been debased. The film takes a surprisingly dramatic and depressing turn as this proud elegant woman gives up her career as well as a sweet relationship with her caring father and succumbs to a life of drinking and prostitution. I was surprised to find myself so engrossed in this operatically tragic tale. I was on the edge of my seat when George blows back into town and unknowingly walks into a hotel where his beautiful Emy is working as a prostitute! Classic drama. I imagine many viewers were a bit frustrated by all this drama. One would expect lots of sex and nudity here but there is not much. And when there is it is totally non-exploitative and very artsy and soft-core. If you are a fan of the first Emmanuelle with Sylvia Kristel than you most likely will appreciate this lesser known classic. I was especially impressed by the extra attention to details. The whole segment where Emy takes George to her fathers house on the island is really nice. Her father shows George and the viewer his impressive collection of Bonzai trees. He has a whole miniature forest built out of these amazing trees. Totally unexpected. After catching it on late night cable TV years ago I spent much time searching the internet for a copy of the film. When i finally got it i found that the video version was longer. More sex? No more melodrama. For the DVD release there is a subplot about George suddenly keeling over with some unknown deadly disease! I actually preferred the cable version better. I am glad that this rare gem has been released finally on DVD. I must also mention the beautiful cinematography and the bizarre and catchy 70's soundtrack. While watching this one you just get the feeling that you are watching something very rare and quite special. I recommend it to thoughtful viewers who don't need sex and violence to maintain their interest. 
 I suppose I always felt that Hotel du Nord was studio-bound the movement of people cars and camera were just too effortlessly smooth and stagey to have been filmed on location. But no problem - it's still a much underrated lovely composition from Marcel Carne. The plot seems a bit choppy at times as if they were making it up as they went along but because it is unpredictable holds the attention to the bitter end. The money shots when the 2 lovers are alone in their room are saddled with some rather stilted dialogue but it's all so lovely to fall into any inanity can be accepted. Are these 2 young people symbols of a cancerous hopelessness in pre-War France or simply idiots? Suicide pacts are fairly common; if the suicidees are young and healthy with their lives before them untrammelled would you think anything other than that they were just misguided fools? Arletty played the part of prostitute well - she kept that zipper on her dress busy throughout anyway! I've only seen a few films with Jouvet - he is the most impressive invention as pimp in HDN - my trouble is shallow: every time I see his face I think of Sonnie Hale in Evergreen! A remarkably atmospheric well acted and photographed film with so much happening it needs a few viewings to get it all in place. Annabella and Aumont made an exceptionally beautiful couple; Francois (Heurtebise) Perier in his 2nd film had a small amusing part as a gay man. All in all: wonderful. 
 William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) buy an old house where a brutal murder happened years ago in very bad condition with the intention of restoring it. They move with their daughter Sophie (Emma RidleY) and become friends of their neighbors Jean (Patricia Maynard) and George Evans (Brian Croucher). However eerie events happen in the house inclusive the death of Sophie's cat. In Sophie's birthday party a pipe leaks blood and they leave the place disclosing a secret later. The House That Bled to Death is a scary and one of the best episodes of the series Hammer House of Horror . The fantastic twist disclosing a secret and the tragic conclusion are really excellent. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): A Casa Que Sangrou At¨¦ Morrer ( The House That Bled to Death ) 
 A 14 year old girl develops her first serious crush on the 17 year old boy that lives near by while simultaneously trying to overcome her feelings of inadequacy in comparison to her older sister. That is the simple premise of this beautiful poetic coming of age film from Director Robert Mulligan. Mulligan is famous for previously directing Summer of '42 in 1971 and To Kill A Mockingbird in 1962 two giants of the coming of age genre. Here he directs newcomers in the principal roles: Reese Witherspoon in her film debut as the 14 year old girl; Emily Warfield as the older sister; Jason London as Court the 17 year old boy. Reese Witherspoon is astonishingly good in her film debut displaying every emotion that a 14 year old girl feels in experiencing young love and hurt never striking a false note. Warfield and London are both equally good as well. The film accurately depicts each adolescent's thoughts or feelings in regard to love with heartfelt sensitivity never crossing over into maudlin excess even once. Kudos to the autobiographical screenplay from Jenny Wingfield; this is one of the very few films about young love that is honest and consistent in tone without being emotionally dishonest or sensationalist. The music is wonderfully simple accentuating the tone and mood from scene to scene but never becoming intrusive. The beautiful cinematography is by famed horror director Freddie Francis who was in his 70's when this was shot. Tess Harper and Sam Waterston play the girls' parents with dead aim accuracy for 1957 caring strict and emotionally simple. Gail Strickland is good also as the boy's mother. There are feelings to sort out lessons to learn and truths to face in this sweet-natured film that packs an emotional wallop. To date this is Robert Mulligan's last film. This is one of the very best films of 1991. **** of 4 stars. 
 Rohmer strays from his usual portraits of french middle class to tell this costume drama about the difficulties of an aristocrat lady during the french revolution. What's more attractive about La Anglaise... (apart from the story itself) is the fabulous aesthetics that Rohmer has achieved. The images have been digitally decorated too make them look like baroque pictures. In some moments you can't really say whether your watching a movie or a series of pictures in Louvre Musseum. Every shot is like a piece of art. *My rate: 7.5/10 ---------------- -------------- - ------------ ------------------- 
 I've noticed that a lot of people who post on the Kerching! board seem to hate this show which I actually find very surprising. I think it's one of the best British kids' shows there is. It's a shame it's ending because it's very funny (if a bit cheesy sometimes) and has great characters. The main character is a little like Del Boy although quite a lot smarter. With his 2 best friends he tried to make a million pounds for his mum by starting an online business and adopting a pseudonym of Rudeboy . His friends are Seymour (who likes to cook) and Danny (who is simple minded and the comic relief character). Throughout the show some characters have left and new ones have come in but it's always been entertaining and improving. 
 This is a really fun breezy light hearted romantic comedy. You cannot go wrong with Meg Ryan's cute perkiness combined with Albert Einstein's genius. Normally I'm not a fan of completely fabricated fictional tales about actual people now deceased and not able to defend themselves but I think the late Einstein might himself have gotten a chuckle out of this one. It's the 1950's...Princeton New Jersey in the spring. The story revolves around a pretty young scatter brained mathematician Catherine (Meg Ryan) who is all set to marry a stuffy jerk a behavioral researcher named James merely because he has the brains she's looking for in the father of her future children. However it's love at first sight when her car breaks and she meets an auto mechanic named Ed (Tim Robbins). As she doesn't think Ed is intelligent enough her uncle none other than Albert Einstein plays match maker assisted in his endeavors by three mischievous cronies all theoretical physicists. Uncle Albert must make Ed appear suitably smart so concocts a charade portraying him as a physicist...naturally with amusing results. Walter Matthau is his usual hilarious self and pulls off the character of Einstein quite effectively. With his three professorial buddies Kurt Nathan and Boris a lot of laughs ensue. The real Einstein had a genuine human side and this film just takes it one (outrageous) step further. If you suspend all logic you can almost imagine this silly story happening! It might not be rocket science (despite its main character) but it is a wonderful sweet refreshing movie. One of the best of the comedy romance genre. 
 I recently purchassed the very underrated Dreamcast and went off into town to find some games to use them on. I bought Soul Calibur (A classic) and then i stepped across the domain of Resident Evil Code Veronica. I have Resident Evil 1 & 2 and have played Res Evil 3 numerous occasions and i have been impressed with all of them especially no.1 which has to go down in history has a classic. But none of them 3 come anywhere near to the dreamcast attempt of Brilliant Gory Gameplay. If its just for the sake of buying a dreamcast for this game it is worth every moment of your time and effort ive never been so enthralled over a computer game in the way this has enthralled me. Anyway the story carrys on from the 2nd story in which Claire Redfield searches for her Brother (Chris - from the 1st story) who is presumed missing under the conspiracy of the dreaded umbrella corporation. Little is known about this corporation except the fact that you though you destroyed them 3 times in the previous storys. So aiding Claire with the assistant of super brat Steve u must unlock the truth of the real location of your brother. The 2nd CD enables you to control Chris thats if you manage to get that far without running out of the room in fear. The control are very slick and the movement of the characters are magnificently realistic when the character notices danger he/she faces the direction it is coming from. PURE GENIUS!! Overall i gave this game 10/10 because it is simply the game of the year game of the decade and the best game in the world full stop!!. Please purchase this game as soon as possible. 
 'The Student of Prague' is an early feature-length horror drama or rather it is an autorenfilm (i.e. an author's film). This film is a member of a movement of many movements that tried to lend respectability to cin¨¦ma or just make a profit by adapting literature or theatre onto the screen. Fortunately the story of this book with moving pictures is good. Using Alfred de Musset's poem and a story by Edgar Allen Poe it centres on the doppelg?nger theme. Unfortunately the most cinematic this film gets is the double exposure effects to make Paul Wegener appear twice within scenes. Guido Seeber was a special effects wizard for his day but he's not very good at positioning the camera or moving it. Film scholar Leon Hunt (printed in Early Cinema: Space Frame Narrative ) however has made an interesting analysis on this film using framing to amplify the doubles theme: characters being split by left/right near/far and frontal/diagonal framing of characters and shots. Regardless the film mostly consists of extended long shots from a fixed position which is noticeably primitive. Worse is the lack of editing; there's very little scene dissection and scenes linger. None of this is unusual for 1913 but there were more advanced films in this respect around the same time including the better parts of 'Atlantis' (August Blom 1913) 'Twilight of a Woman's Soul' (Yevgeni Bauer 1913) and the short films of D.W. Griffith. An expanded universal film vocabulary by 1926 would allow for a vastly superior remake. Furthermore the remake has a reason for the Lyduschka character other than being an occasional troublemaker and spectator surrogate. Here the obtrusively acted gypsy lurks around seemingly with a cloak of invisibility. I know their world is silent to me but I assume with their lips moving and such that their world would not be silent to them so how can Lyduschka leer over others' shoulders and not be noticed? Nevertheless this is one of the most interesting early films conceptually. Wegener who seems to have been the primary mind behind this film in addition to playing the lead would later play the title role and co-direct 'The Golem' in 1920--helping to further inaugurate the supernatural thread in German silent cin¨¦ma. (Note: The first version I viewed was about an hour long (surely not quite complete) and was in poor condition with faces bleached at times and such. I'm not sure who was the distributor. I've also since seen the Alpha DVD which at 41 minutes is missing footage present in the aforementioned print and also has fewer and very different title cards but is visually not as bad. The repetitive score is best muted though.) 
 I thought this movie was very well done. Taking place in the mid 1950's everything looked accurate to me. It was well cast and believable. I don't usually care much for this type of movie because they just don't have any depth but I felt this movie delved in to the characters and you could feel how they felt you got to really know them and care about them. It did take me back to my youth and let me reminiscent about a more innocent time. This movie could be enjoyed by both male and female and by all age groups. After the movie was over I wished there was a part two. I wanted to know what happened to Dani and her family. This movie is bound to be a classic. If you haven't seen it you should try to catch it when it is on TV or rent it... 
 Fantastic movie. One to excite all 5 senses. Is not a true historical report and not all information is to be taken as factual information. True Hollywood conventions used like playing A list and VERY attractive actors as the 'heroes' such as Naomi Watts (Julia Cook - Ned Kelly's lover) Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne - Ned's right hand man) and unattractive (sorry Geoffrey Rush) actors play the drunken and corrupt Victorian Police Force. This also instills a very unreliable love story into the mix between Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts) to entice all the romantics females being especially susceptible. Even from the first scene when Ned saves the fat youth from drowning and his dad calls him sunshine and had a glint in his eye as he looked down at me his hand on me shoulder it is very romanticized and persuades viewers to side with Ned Kelly the underdog. Besides don't all Aussies love an underdog? 
 Before films like 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ' 'Suspiria ' and 'Halloween' changed the view of horror forever there was a more Gothic and far less violent era in the genre. Films like the Hammer Horror series and 'Rosemary's Baby' were what scared and thrilled audiences throughout the 60s and early 70s. I can't tell you how many times I rented this film during my childhood but I did because there was something about it. I didn't want to limit myself to the slasher and zombies movies of the 70s and 80s and films like this production from the famous but sadly long gone Amicus film company were a good start. Pros: A grand eerie music score. Strong performances from a stellar cast. Brilliant cinematography. Plenty good old fashioned thrills and chills especially in the first and last vignettes. Some haunting moments and images. Moves at a slow but stead pace. The house is one spooky oppressive dwelling. Great production design and set decoration which give the film a real old Gothic horror feel. Depends more on mood and bloodless chills than on gore and gratuitous nudity for it's thrills. Cons: Some pacing issues in the first half. Aside from the 'The Cloak ' the rest of the stories feel like they've been done before. Clich¨¦s galore. The second story 'Waxworks ' has fine acting and it's moments but is the weakest of the four in terms of scares and suspense. The low budget really shows at times. Final thoughts: After seeing this film for the first time in many years I can see why I rented it so frequently. It's not a masterpiece by any means but it's a good example of a time when horror films were made with style and class. Watch this one with the lights off. My rating: 3.5/5 
 Emma is a horribly flawed film based on Jane Austens classic novel. I have not read the book so I really didn't know that much about the plot and yet I still predicted nearly the entire plot. There were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing. The film is though for some reason very entertaining and I loved it. Of course there were all the scenes I disliked but the majority was well acted and funny. Gwyneth Paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in Emma. The film also stars Toni Collette(Who has okay but has been much better) Ewan Mecgreger(Who has also been better but he is still very good here) Alan Cumming(Who I have never really been impressed with and is pretty much the same here) and Jeremy Northam(Who's performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle even if that was not what it needed) There have been much better adaptations of Jane Austen books but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching. 
 The year is 1896.Jeff Webster (James Stewart) doesn't like people.There's only one friend he's got and he's Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) an old sympathetic man.They're driving a cattle herd with them.That would be their key to richness.In Skagway they run into trouble when Sheriff Gannon (John McIntire) takes the cattle.Now Jeff only has to get it back and drive it through the U.S. Canadian border to Dawson.Now they have a group of other people with them like the ladies Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) and Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvet).There the two men get into the gold business.Anthony Mann's and James Stewart's fourth collaboration The Far Country (1954) is a fine western indeed.The acting work is superb.Walter Brennan makes a terrific sidekick to Stewart.Ruth Roman is brilliant and Corinne Calvet's delightful.Jay C. Flippen is very good as Dawson Marshal Rube Morris.The great Jack Elam and Kathleen Freeman are seen in smaller roles.It's fantastic to watch how Jimmy Stewart overcome's all the troubles in his way.There's just the man and his rifle.But also he's vulnerable. 
 question: how do you steal a scene from the expert of expert scene stealers Walther Mathau in full furious and brilliant Grumpy Old Man mode? answer: quietly deadpan and with perfect timing as George Burns does here. I know nothing of Vaudeville but this remains a favourite film the two leads are hilarious the script funny the direction and pacing very fine. Richard Benjamin is very funny as straight man - trying to get at Burns through the window etc. Even the small parts are great. There are so many funny scenes Mathau messing up the commercial Burns repeating his answers as if senile... A delight. Enterrrrrr! 
 I LOVED this movie! I am biased seeing as I am a huge Disney fan but I really enjoyed myself. The action takes off running in the beginning of the film and just keeps going! This is a bit of a departure for Disney they don't spend quite as much time on character development (my husband pointed this out)and there are no musical numbers. It is strictly action adventure. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who loves Disney be they young or old. 
 I watch a lot of films good bad and indifferent; there is usually something of interest to fixate upon even if it is only set design or the reliable labor of a good character actor or the fortuitous laughter that emerges from watching ineptitude captured forever. However I was quite pleasantly surprised by this film one I had never seen before. Graham Greene has been translated into film many times of course in such masterpieces as Thin Man and in lesser vehicles. Confidential Agent is one of those lesser vehicles yet it manages to get me somewhere anyway despite lackluster direction the incongruity of Bacall and Boyer's depictions as (respectively) British and Spanish and the almost complete non-existence of any chemistry between the two leads. In some ways this last problem actually begins to work in the film's favor for how can love really blossom in the killing atmosphere of fascism and capitalism meeting about one person's tragedy? The most compelling aspect of the film arises directly from Greene's complex and guilt-ridden psychology which pervades the film. I know some see the deliberate pacing here as dull and I can understand that. Yet I found that plodding accentuated rather than detracted from what is a claustrophobic world. I was compelled to watch not by any great acting (although Boyer is marvelous as usual managing to convey a rich mixture of world-weariness tragedy hope and fervor with his magnificent voice and yearning eyes) but by the down-spiraling rush of one man's slim hopes against a world of oppression and money. What is a thief? What good is love in the face of death? Where does mere profit-taking end and exploitation begin? The film does not rise to the level of art and thus cannot hope to answer such questions but it is much more than mere entertainment and its murders and guilts are very grimly drawn. The lack of glitz of bubble of narrative bounce help to make this movie very worthwhile. And there is no happy ending for history wrote the ending. 
 Just watched the film for the 3rd time and enjoyed Lindsay Crouse and the rest of the cast just as much as before. It just keeps getting better and better. You simply have to marvel at the carefully measured way of speech the slow deliberate action everything being exactly in place. Truly one of the great ones and definitely my all-time favourite!!! 
 This will be a different kind of review. I've seen this movie twice on TV and would like to have a copy because it talks about Panama City and the beach in the winter time which is my favorite time to be there. It was the first movie I'd seen by Ashley Judd and she was great and I've enjoyed every other thing I've seen her in. Sundance's reaction made an impression on me too as did the director Victor Nunez who has directed and written several movies about Florida. This movie speaks to me and I've seen nothing with which to compare it. The plot speaks less to me than the surroundings. Well I told you it would be a different kind of review. 
 What percentage of movies does a person go to see these days that leave them wondering what happened to their eight to ten dollars? ANSWER: TOO MANY! This movie isn't like that. It is a story about real people that are sometimes a combination of both likable and unlikable. Downside: Not enough character development & some plot lines left twisting in the wind. Upside: Forces viewers to think about the choices they have made for good or bad in their own lives. Well acted by: Scott Cohen Judd Hirsch Susan Floyd Ato Essandoh and Elliot Korte. Contains some good lighthearted humor. 
 Passport to Pimlico is a real treat for all fans of British cinema. Not only is it an enjoyable and thoroughly entertaining comedy but it is a cinematic flashback to a bygone age with attitudes and scenarios sadly now only a memory in British life. Stanley Holloway plays Pimlico resident Arthur Pemberton who after the accidental detonation of an unexploded bomb discovers a wealth of medieval treasure belonging to the 14th Century Duke of Burgundy that has been buried deep underneath their little suburban street these last 600 years. Accompanying the treasure is an ancient legal decree signed by King Edward IV of England (which has never been officially rescinded) to state that that particular London street had been declared Burgandian soil which means that in the eyes of international law Pemberton and the other local residents are no longer British subjects but natives of Burgundy and their tiny street an independent country in it's own right and a law unto itself. This sets the war-battered and impoverished residents up in good stead as they believe themselves to be outside of English law and jurisdiction so in an act of drunken defiance they burn their ration books destroy and ignore their clothing coupons flagrantly disregard British licencing laws etc declaring themselves fully independent from Britain. However what then happens is ever spiv black marketeer and dishonest crook follows suit and crosses the 'border' into Burgundy as a refuge from the law and post-war restrictions to sell their dodgy goods and half of London's consumers follow them in order to dodge the ration making their quiet happy little haven a den of thieves and a rather crowded one at that. Appealing to Whitehall for assistance they are told that due to developments this is now a matter of foreign policy which His Majesty's Government is reluctant to become involved which leaves the residents high and dry. They do however declare the area a legal frontier and as such set up a fully equipped customs office at the end of the road mainly to monitor smuggling than to ensure any safety for the residents of Pimlico. Eventually the border is closed altogether starting a major siege with the Bugundian residents slowly running out of water and food but never the less fighting on in true British style. As one Bugundian resident quotes we're English and we always were English and it's just because we are English we are fighting so hard to be Bugundians A sentiment that is soon echoed throughout the capital as when the rest of London learn of the poor Bugundians plight they all feel compelled to chip in and help them by throwing food and supplies over the barbed wire blockades. Will Whitehall who has fought off so may invaders throughout the centuries finally be brought to it's knees by this new batch of foreigners especially as these ones are English!!!! Great tale and great fun throughout. Not to be missed. 
 The Sensuous Nurse (1975) was a Italian sexual comedy that starred the one time Bond girl Ursula Andress. Man was she hot in this movie.. She was stacked and built like a *@#% brick house. Ursula was smoking hot in this movie. I have never seen a nurse's outfit that filled out before. Ms. Andress stars as a nurse who is hired to take care of a rich elderly man. Even one in the house seems to be knocking the boots. One night the nurse decides to take the grandson's temperature and give some needed T.L.C. to her ancient client. The old man takes to his nurse and this angers the rest of the family. What kind of job did the family hire her out to do? Will the geezer fall for her car giver? How can she deal with the octogenarian crone and the rest of the family? To find out you need to find a copy of the SENSUOUS NURSE!! Italian but badly dubbed into English. Highly recommended. 
 This is the fifth von Trier film I have seen. I believe that he is the only director to whom I have given such a high score on all his movies. Four of them The Element of Crime Europa Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark I have given a 10 and one The Idiots I have given a 9 (and I have been reconsidering whether to give it a 10 since I first saw it although I'd like to see it once more before I do). He has been chided for calling himself one of the best working directors. I tend to agree with him. I cannot blame him for being arrogant when he has made such great films. In 50 years when von Trier retires he will be looked upon as the pre-eminent film artist from Europe (perhaps from the planet) and there will be classes taught in his name. He simply is the Bergman or Fellini of our time. It is too bad the critics are too intrigued with themselves to notice this. About Europa itself I'll admit that it was confusing and that its narrative did not seem strong. I think that's the point. This film was obviously meant to represent a nightmare or the subconscious at some level. This is absolutely clear from the framing of the film: Max von Sydow's narration. We are hypnotized or von Trier is hypnotized and this is our/his subconscious mind. I'm inclined to lean more towards his mind since the degradation of Europe concerns me an American very little. This framing is also clear if you have seen The Element of Crime an even more brilliant film than this (although I am disputing that in my mind; what Europa needs more than anything is a proper release on DVD hopefully Criterion again with theatrical aspect ratio and remastered sound and picture; then I am fairly sure this film would seem as great as any of von Trier's other films). In The Element of Crime the film begins with a hypnotist whom we actually see on screen this time is hypnotizing Fisher a European detective who wants to get to the root of his mental anguish. The first words of that film are Fantasy is okay but my job is to keep you on track. And whenever Fisher the narrator gets off track the hypnotist does chastize him and tells him to get back on with the story. He even laughs when a character is given a really silly and trite line. Something along the lines of Do you understand the difference between good and evil? The hypnotist laughs and says Now Fisher she didn't really say that did she? So the key to interpreting Europa almost a sequel of sorts to The Element of Crime is that we are deep in our/von Trier's subconscious and the symbols there are to be interpreted within ourselves and will likely be different for everyone. What does the train itself symbolize? Consider it internally and only then discuss it externally. Europa is a great film a masterpiece. I was never bored by it even though I watched it at 3 am. The perfect time to watch actually since it works in dream logic. 
 Dressed to Kill is surely one of the best horror/thriller movies ever made.It's taut stylish and extremely suspenseful mixture of sex and violence.The acting is pretty good the orchestral score by Pino Donaggio is unforgettable and there's plenty of surprises to keep thriller fans intrigued. Dressed to Kill is a murder mystery that involves a sexually frustrated housewife(Angie Dickinson) her teenage son(Keith Gordon) her psychoanalyst(Michael Caine) and a high price call girl(Nancy Allen).The murderer in the film is a transsexual named Bobbi who is also one of Caine's patients.The film is full of breathtaking moments:the infamous elevator murder scene is extremely stylish and pretty gory as well.Highly recommended. 
 I loved this movie for two reasons: 1) Jeff Combs is absolutely wonderful in it. Plays the role of the modern wizard to the hilt. (And is absolutely adorable.) 2) The movie helped to inspire a role-playing game I thoroughly enjoy Mage: The Awakening. I've shown it at various LARP after-parties and it's always a big hit. D&D love and Jeff-squeeing aside it's not exactly a masterpiece but it's well-done and thoroughly enjoyable. The plot is fast-moving and engaging in its simplicity the special effects are pretty good for such a low budget and the script while nothing stellar was not too badly done and cheesy in all the right places. A good way to spend an evening. 
 In answer to the person who made the comment about how the film drags on and who believed there was no purpose to the role of Jess's brother here is my response: The role of Jess's brother is to provide a form of dramatic irony in the story. Craig Sheffer/Norman could have foreseen the troubles associated with living life to the full by looking at how Jess's brother turned out. There are various instances where Brad Pitt and his lives run in parallel for example when Jess's brother takes Craig Sheffer to a disjointed bar and subsequently he finds Brad Pitt there a few days later. The dramatic irony was there so Craig Sheffer's character would have a bigger emotional turmoil at his brothers death knowing he could have done more to prevent it and subsequently creates a more compelling mood in the film. 
 After having watched Guinea Pig two questions come in mind ( besides 'Am I really a psychopath to watch that ?' ) : 'Is it a snuff ?' The answer is no ; although it's the closest thing to a snuff movie I've ever seen. And then : 'Where the hell have they found that girl ?'. Because she gets tortured for '45 min without any reasons given ( in fact there is nothing else in this movie !) : Fingernails teared off beaten with hands feet tools infested by maggots ... and many more until the final scene ( I'm still not sure how they did that ). Because it belongs to the 'japonese underground scene' it's obvious she didn't get a lot of money. So what were her ( their ) motivations ? I saw it in japonese without subtitles but it's not a problem ( no real dialogues the boys are just insulting her in a few scenes ). I haven't seen yet all the serial but the first Guinea Pig is not known for being the best one. Still I've rated 8 because if the purpose was making people believe this a snuff the issue is quite good ( ask Charlie Sheen the actor ). But I think they could have gone further which they did in the following ones. Another movie I'm hiding from my parents. 8/10 
 Distortion is a disturbing haunting film about life imitating art and art reflecting life. Haim Bouzaglo the director of the film plays the role of Haim Bouzaglo artistically blocked and sexually impotent playwright who finds inspiration in his suspicions about the subject of his girl friend's documentary. As an Arab suicide bomber disguised in skullcap and American t-shirt wanders through the landscape in search of his target and his nerves Haim transcribes his girl friend's life as she films her documentary and incorporates himself and his actors' lives during rehearsals. But the bomber has already struck and Haim has left the restaurant just minutes earlier. Despite the manipulation of time and space the story is crystal clear comprehensive and absorbing a brilliant commentary on the distortion of everyday Israeli life where the political is intertwined with the personal where everyone lives on the edge and people never know whether they are playing leading roles in their own lives or are merely dispensable bit players in someone else's dramatic narrative. Bouzaglo plays with this notion of everyone being an actor in someone else's production brilliantly. We are always voyeurs seeing what the fictional director sees illicitly but also what the real director chooses to reveal. To remind us that these glimpses are violations of privacy Bouzaglo takes us into the bathroom and the bedroom (sometimes the bedroom is the street and rooftop) and repeatedly frames his views within TV video or security screens. Actors play the role of actors who represent the real characters played by actors. Of course each of the actors is the star of his or her own production only dimly aware of their diminished roles in their fellow actor's personal films. The detective hired by the playwright becomes a character in the play. The actor hired to play the role of the detective seeks out the detective for tips on how to play the role is caught by the detective on surveillance tapes and they attend a cast party as their real selves. Despite this multiplicity of views there is no mistaking the clear lines of this narrative: the playwright searches for subject matter the bomber seeks a target and the detective stalks the filmmaker. Nor is there any difficulty locating Bouzaglo's ultimate target?enervated and impotent Israel fully conscious of the threatening peril but incapable of meaningful action. Israel is Bouzaglo the impotent fictional playwright cannibalizing his own life for his play. Israel is also the bankrupt soldier-entrepreneur who is the subject of the filmmaker's documentary the cheating actors and actresses and the cuckolded husband. They are all Israel because they are all helpless caught in inaction or aimless action as the bomber scans the landscape for his best target. All the characters can do as another bombing is reported is have sex and keep score of victims. There is personal triumph vindication perhaps revenge at the end of this play within a story within a film but viewers will be left aching for the state of Israel even as they are filled with admiration for Bouzaglo's memorable rendition of a nation's plight within the telling of an individual's story. 
 Renny Harlin's first American film was one of the best of a slew of prison-set horror films(like Death House or The Chair )in the late 80's.Twenty years before guard Lane Smith had wrongfully executed a condemned man.Now he is the warden of the newly re-opened prison and the man's ghost is back for bloody revenge.This atmospheric and very moody film features lots of gruesome gore and violence.Viggo Mortensen Tiny Lister Tom Everett and Kane Hodder are onhand for the entertaining carnage. 
 What the movie The 60s really represents (to those of us who growled around in the belly of America in those times) is the turbulence and diversity of the decade. Despite the exaggerated stereotyped characters the genuineness of the issues remains clear. Not only were those radical times of change but also very confusing times. Two basic things changed our world then: the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the overwhelming influence of the media. Those two new freedoms began social changes that soon became institutionalized. From chaos came sensitivity from disorder came values. Bear in mind however that the bulk of Americans were not involved in this... they worked they played they watched the news... and slowly they became effected by the efforts and struggles of the minorities... the Civil Rights workers the Political Activists the Anti-War efforts the War on Poverty.... The representation of the power of the press and TV in particular was well reflected although the conflict between the general public's attitude and those seeking to change things was at best ignored... and at worst misrepresented.. Middle class Americans weren't all standing around angrily holding baseball bats or disowning their wayward daughters. They were confused too. Let us not forget how Folk Singers suddenly became Protest Singers and how The Beatles began an onslaught that killed the Folk-Protest Movement. There are no Beatle songs in the movie or even any mention of them. I think if you didn't live the decade you might not have a sense of what the movie is about the overall picture is a bit dim. At one point I held down a steady job while my sister lived at the Hog Farm Commune and went to Woodstock. At another point I was in Haight Asbury and in the Detroit Riots while she worked and played the housewife in Maine and Connecticut. Roles were constantly changing. The movie depicts three siblings of a middle class family. They represent the hippie child the political activist and the active military personnel. Dad represents the typical attitudes and mom represents the voice of reason tolerance and sometimes compromise... for the sake of peace. The Black family comprises a minister and his son... disproportionately I think. I assume the producers knew all the variables and had to settle on limitations or else the film would have become a long boring documentary. Dad's message was that anger produces bitterness and bitterness produces chaos. It was clearly a message directed to today's youth. We are looking at a unique solution to social problems and also how issues divide us... The 60s were unusual in that way and only the Roaring 20s compare. In other words this movie has a moral after all. In the end it is our Collective Individualism that survives. Put that in your oxymoron list. Everyone was a God a Guru or a free-spirited genius in the 60s. It was a time of magic and madness. No one will ever nail the 60s down right... it was too diverse (this movie is close). At least we can say we are not ashamed of it that we learned and grew from it and that for once a generation shaped and changed America... for the better. 
 A film about wannabee's never-were's and less-than-heroes making it against all odds. Where have we heard that before. But when the unfortunates are the Shoveller the Blue Raja and Mr.Furious you know this is not your conventional rags to riches story. A classic performance by Eddie Izzard as Tony P. one of the Disco boys leaders and Geoffrey Rush as Arch Villain shows actual thought went into the casting. Even Greg Kinnear at first glance an odd choice for the role of Captain Amazing turns out spot on. Watch this film if you're sick of comic-gone-film stereotypes. Why couldn't anger be a super power? 
 This movie is a journey through the mind of a screenwriter caught in his own paradoxical philosophy. He examines the ever illusive question of 'who am I' and 'what is I?' It's a courageous and thought provoking enterprise. There is a shipload of beautiful images dream-inspired Escher-like paradoxes reminiscent of the hand drawing itself or rather erasing itself. More and more we follow the writer in his agony over what to say and what to film we see him phoning with his wife who left for Peru leaving him to take care of their baby a task he performs with less and less attention until he's so absorbed in his dilemma's that he hardly looks at the child anymore. His wife comes back and makes a scene destroys his notes and helping him go over the last treshold until he erases him-self. Interspersed with eye-pleasing and I-destructing images the story is mainly philosophical. It's about the veils of Maya the world of illusion. The paradox of the movie however is that it needs a lot of talking and thinking to prove that thinking should stop. During the more than two hours of provocative beauty and rapid philosophising the movie made me long for silence or a shorter movie. If that was the purpose of the maker he succeeded quite well. 
 A Christmas Together actually came before my time but I've been raised on John Denver and the songs from this special were always my family's Christmas music. For years we had a crackling cassette made from a record that meant it was Christmas. A few years ago I was finally able to track down a video of it on Ebay so after listening to all the music for some 21 years I got to see John and the Muppets in action for myself. If you ever get the chance it's a lot of fun--great music heart-warming and cheesy. It's also interesting to see the 70's versions of the Muppets and compare them to their newer versions today. I believe Denver actually took some heat for doing a show like this--I guess normally performers don't compromise their images by doing sing-a-longs with the Muppets but I'm glad he did. Even if you can't track down the video the soundtrack is worth it too. It has some Muppified traditional favorites but also some original Denver tunes as well. 
 Don't know how this missed award nominations. Great film. Certainly of the calibre of Beautiful Mind Great acting photography script and drama. I can't imagine anyone not being entranced by this film. 
 I have to totally disagree with the other comment concerning this movie. The visual effects complement the supernatural themes of the movie and do not detract from the plot furthermore I loved how this move was unlike Crouching Tiger because this time the sword action had no strings attached and most of the time you can see the action up close. I think western audiences will be very confused with 2 scenes one of which involves a monk trying to burn himself alive and the other concerning the villagers chanting that it is the end of the world. The mentioned scenes are derived from certain interpretations of Mahayana Buddhist text (Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China Korea and Japan) and the other scene deals with a quirk in the Japanese calendar...people back then really thought that the world would come to an end... Gojoe has the action story and visuals to mesmerize any viewer. I strongly believe that with some skillful editing it can be sold in the U.S. My one complaint is in the last fight scene (I can't give anything away--sorry). 
 Brian Dennehy Bill Paxton Joe Pantalino and best of all Jeff Fahey all in one film. Wow is all I can think to say about that. These are four of the most underrated actors in the biz and they work beautifully together. It's like poetry the way they play off each other and ooze the natural ability to seem as though they had been best buddies for eons for even shooting the film. The film itself is fine and one that can be quite intense to view the first time and the four stars help the re-watch-ability to a great extent. I cannot describe how good it was to see Bill Paxton and Jeff Fahey together on screen the greatest moment being when they watch a couple from a distance and fill in the vocals themselves it almost brought a tear to my eyes. A good film a great cast go see. Why? Four words Fahey Dennehy Paxton Pantalino. 
 CAT SOUP is a short anime based on the legendary manga Nekojiru. It won the award Best Short Film at The 6th Fantasia Film Festival and also won the Excellence Prize at Japan's Media Arts Festival. When little kitten Nyaako's soul is stolen by Death she and her brother Nyatta embark on a bizarre journey to get it back. In the surreal dreamscape of the Other Side they encounter many fantastic characters and remarkable often disturbing adventures. CAT SOUP is an anime like nothing you've ever seen. It's Hello Kitty on acid! It is very original stunningly beautiful and possess a great sense of strangeness and lyricism. CAT SOUP is very surrealistic (there are no dialogue) and sometimes cruel and gory. So it is more an anime for adults than children (they may not understand at all!). A great journey for those who get the chance to see this absolute masterpiece. An must-see! 
 Well the movie isn't exactly funny. Okay I admit there are a few HUMOROUS lines but definitely nothing that is laugh-out-loud funny. For example: Right before a steamy sex scene between Eleniak and one of her male costars sh is handcuffed to the bedpost and he cannot remove her shirt. Before leaving the room to retrieve the key he tells her Okay don't go anywhere. See humorous but not funny. The plot and acting are pretty good. But Erika Eleniak definitely steals the show. She's hot and sexy and there is a really steamy scene with her that one can't help but rewind and re-watch. There are also some other very sexy scenes with her and she has some very provocative lines. Overall 5 stars. I'd only give it three if not for Erika Eleniak. 
 Interesting way of looking at how we as humans so often behave we are sometimes blinded by our desire to achieve perfection that we some times destroy the foundation of what we are trying to achieve. It also addresses the issue how we tend to ignore those among us who are not as outspoken and by doing this may miss out on a great opportunity. The injection of comedy also makes watching the film an enjoyable experience..A must see for anyone who is interested in a reflective yet comical look at life. I am eagerly looking forward to your next product.Hope that you will continue to provide us with quality entertainment. Excellent work ......Joanne 
 Excellent film dealing with the life of an old man as he looks back over the years. Starting around 1910 he reminisces about his boy and young adulthood; his family friends romances etc. Very nostalgic piece with a bittersweet finale.... all things in life come together as one and a river runs through it. And that river haunts me. Worth seeing. 
 Paul Verhoeven's predecessor to his breakout hit 'Basic Instinct' is a stylish and shocking neo-noir thriller. Verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films both in his native Holland and in America and this film is one of the reasons why. The Fourth Man follows the strange story of Gerard Reve (played by Jeroen Krabb¨¦); a gay alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to Vlissingen to give a talk on the stories he writes. While there he meets the seductive Christine Halsslag (Ren¨¦e Soutendijk) who takes him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him even if it kills him. Paul Verhoeven twists the truth many times in this film and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it. Many of the occurrences in The Fourth Man could be what they appear to be but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for the duration and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it thrives on. Paul Verhoeven is not a filmmaker that feels he has to restrain himself and that is one of things I like best about him. This film features a very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards (and that doesn't happen very often!). I wont spoil it because it needs the surprise element to work...but you'll see what I mean when you see the film (make sure you get the uncut version!). There is also a number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than the one I've mentioned but are lovely nonetheless; a man gets eaten by lions another one has a pipe sent through his skull a boat is smashed in half...lovely. The acting in The Fourth Man isn't anything to write home about but it's solid throughout. Jeroen Krabb¨¦ holds the audience's attention and looks the part as the drunken writer. It is Ren¨¦e Soutendijk that impresses the most though as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale. Her performance is what Sharon Stone would imitate nine years later with Basic Instinct but the original fatale did it best. Paul Verhoeven's direction is solid throughout as he directs our attention through numerous points of view all of which help to create the mystery of the story. Verhoeven has gone on to make some rubbish but he obviously has talent and it's a shame that he doesn't put it to better use. Of all the Verhoeven films I've seen this is the best and although it might be difficult to come across; trust me it's worth the effort. 
 Shot on an impossible schedule and no budget to speak of the movie turned out a lot better than you would expect certainly much more true to the Peter O'Donnell books and comic strip than the previous two films. You can read the strip currently in the reprints from Titan Books or in Comics Revue monthly. It is one of the greatest adventure comic strips of all time. The movie isn't great but unlike most low budget films it makes the most of what its got and it holds your interest. On the DVD extras the interview with Quentin Tarentino who is obviously stoned is a gas. Some people have faulted Tarentino for associating his name with the film but without him it would never have been made. He is a Modesty Blaise fan and picked a good writer and director. All things considered worth 8 stars. 
 Pushing Daisies truly is a landmark in Television as an art form. Everything seems to pay homage to Amelie and Tim Burton but so what in a world where fresh ideas are distinctly rare this show will guarantee that you do not care about whether its fresh or not. It is just Brilliant. I have been captivated from the start the intelligent writing the Directing to the backdrops and dialogue make this show the most incredible masterpiece since The Shield and The Wire (ok not exactly good comparisons but the beauty of Pushing Daisies is that it has no comparisons on television). Truly addictive and an absolute pleasure. Perhaps like one of the Piemakers pies that get mentioned in such tantalising ways. 
 This movie was a fantastic comedy. It had a lot of comedians star in it like Akshay Kumar Rajpal Yadav Paresh Raval and John Abraham. Rimi Sen was good at playing Akshay Kumars wife and so were all the air hostesses. Mr Hot as Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Mr cool as Sam (John Abraham) are two fashion photographers who like the same girl Maggie (Neha Dupia). When John Abraham cheats on his work he becomes Akshay Kumars senior and Akshay Kumar gets really jealous because his flat has to be given to John Abraham and Neha Dupia starts liking John more. Akshay Kumar wants to be better than John Abraham so he finds a flat and he is going out with three different girls (Nitu Chandra Nargis Bagheri Daisy Boppana). 
 Critics need to review what they class as a quality movie. I think the critics have seen too many actions films and have succumbed to the Matrix style of films. Europa is a breath of fresh air a film with so many layers that one viewing is not enough to understand or appreciate this outstanding film. Lars von Trier shows that old styles of filming can produce marvellous cinema and build drama and tension. The back projection effect he uses during the film arouses and enhances the characters and the focus of the conversation they are having. Other effects he uses such as the colour and black and white in one scene much like Hitchcock and the girl with the red coat grabs attention and enhances the drama and meaning of the scene. The commentary is superb and has a hypnotic effect again maintaining the focus on the central characters in the scene and there actions. I could talk about the effects more but I think you all would agree they push this film into a category of its own and really heighten the drama of the film. A film to buy if you don't own already and one to see if you have not. 10/10 Don't miss this artistic noir film from one of the great film directors. 
 I must admit that at the beginning I was sort of reticent about watching this movie. I thought it was this stupid little romantic film about a French woman who meets in the train an American and decides to visit Vienna with him. I was not actually enchanted about this kind of script since it continued to make me believe that it is just a movie. Still I watched it! And I was amazed... Before Sunrise is one of the few films who dare to talk in a rather philosophical way wondering about the fact that in the moment of our birth we are sentenced to death or that it is a middling idea that fact that a couple should rest together for eternity or that we humans can afford sometimes to live in fairy-tales. The ending was wonderfully chosen (we do not know if they will meet again in six months at six o'clock in Vienna's station) -in our optimism we sincerely hope so. The actors acted in a very good manner so that I began to believe that I myself could live a love-story just like this. 
 The film is very complete in what it is keeping one continuously interested with the flashbacks to childhood and growing up with such a bizarre father and interspersing it with the tails of serial murder one simply cannot go wrong. The very plot in itself the very story and essence of the film is entertaining. It is the sort of story that the director (Bill Paxton) could do so much with and in this case he really did do a lot with it. From beginning to end you are kept anticipating more and more about what is happening and where the film is going and the creativity that is behind this story is first class. I felt as if this film was exquisitely done from start to finish and one of those rare gems that seemed to be without any boring lulls -- the action flowing neatly quickly and tightly from one scene to the next. It demonstrates just how far people can go: so as to do such horrible things to their loved ones and to do such acts of evil in the name of 'God' when they are disillusioned as in this case. It also is sometimes interesting in its' twists & takes on the concept of morality as a whole. Overall this is the sort of film that one easily overlooks but I would recommend you to not do likewise and to check this film out -- it is very much so worth your time. 
 Daniel Day-Lewis is the most versatile actor alive. English aristocratic snob in A Room With a View passionate Irish thief in In the Name of the Father an impudent violent butcher in Gangs of New York (in a performance ten times stronger than Adrian Brody's in the Pianist) and as the outrageous Cristy Brown with cerebral palsy in My Left Foot (just to name a few). His roles all influence eachother but each is seperate and utterly unique. He changes completely with each character he takes on. And I'm beginning to believe that he can act as anything. Anything. As Cristy Brown he is stunning. He does not ridicule the character and he does not pity the character. A difficult achievement. And Cristy Brown comes to life. A smart man. An outrageous man. Human. This movie despite small scene-transition faults and the like is an inspiration. Yes it's predictable. But is it stupidly sentimental? No. I laughed. I cried. Not a single moment of cheese. Proof that this isn't a Hollywood movie. My favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant when Cristy is discussing painters with Eileen Peter and her friends. Here's where Daniel Day-Lewis reaches an acting climax. I'll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that's animated. Wheel out the cripple! And his performance never slows down never falters and is beautiful. Simply. He has a lot of screen time here. I watch it again again and I never get tired of Cristy's perspicacious eyes twitching and guttural speeches. A must-see. Fo sho yo! 
 Almost 30 years later I recall this original PBS film as almost unbearably tender. Periodically I check here at IMDb hoping that someone has had the good sense to purchase the rights and put it on a DVD. It's September of 2004 and I keep hoping -- deep sigh. One of the two lead actors went on to a small career primarily in a prime-time evening soap; the other Frances Lee McCain was seen in small roles here and there for a few years. But nothing they did before or after ever matched this little movie which was produced as I recall it on a short-lived PBS series which showcased original screenplays by new and up-and-coming playwrights. I watched it every time it was shown on PBS maybe 2 or 3 times. That was before the era of VCRs so I have no record of it except in my mind's eye. 12/31/2006 addition to above: Happy New Year ladies! This wonderful film is finally available on DVD at ladyslipper.org. My understanding is that the DVDs are burned from the writer's own personal copy. 
 Los Angeles TV news reporter Jennifer (the beautiful Barbara Bach of The Spy Who Loved Me fame) and her two assistants Karen (the appealingly spunky Karen Lamm) and Vicki (the pretty Lois Young who not only gets killed first but also bares her yummy bod in a tasty gratuitous nude bath scene) go to Solvang California to cover an annual Danish festival. Since all the local hotels are booked solid the three lovely ladies are forced to seek room and board at a swanky but foreboding remote mansion owned by freaky Ernest Keller (deliciously played to geeky perfection by the late great Sydney Lassick) and his meek sister Virginia (a solid Lelia Goldoni). Unfortunately Keller has one very nasty and lethal dark family secret residing in his dank basement: a portly pathetic diapered incest-spawned man-child Mongoloid named Junior (an alternately touching and terrifying portrayal by Stephen Furst; Flounder in Animal House ) who naturally gets loose and wreaks some murderous havoc. Capably directed by Danny Steinmann with uniformly fine acting from a sturdy cast a compellingly perverse plot excellent make-up by Craig Reardon a nicely creepy atmosphere a wonderfully wild climax a slow but steady pace likable well-drawn characters and a surprisingly heart-breaking final freeze frame (the incest subplot packs an unexpectedly strong and poignant punch) this unjustly overlooked early 80's psycho sleeper is well worth checking out. 
 This movie has everything a fantasy movie should have romance clever witticisms great acting and a fair dose of magic. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was drawn to its original plot (based on the Neil Gaiman novel which I am now looking to read) and colorful characters. One of the most striking things to me actually was how self contained the story is. Unlike so many sci-fi fantasy movies out there right now which leave open-endings and such this was a pure fairy-tale satisfying in and of itself with no need for a sequel. Original. Fun. Feel-good Fantasy. 
 This movie is a riot. I cannot remember the last time I had such a great time at the movies. I've seen a few good comedies in my time and usually they are pretty funny. But this one is wall to wall great lines. I think Best in Show is the last movie that I laughed so hard and so much in. The movie was non-stop until the end when they did the 5 minutes of sentimental plot clean up. Other than that it's a constant barrage of one liners and goofy situations. I'd like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the Zucker movies where you don't get all the jokes the first time around. You have to see it two or three times to get it all in. As far as the actual film goes it could have used a better edit it's choppy at times but we have to be forgiving for that. All the characters are great. It's not like an Adam Sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke. I think I will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so likable. No victims in this movie. Also thank God they got a 45 year old actress to play his girlfriend. Catherine Keener plays her and she is a sweetheart in this film. You just wish that women like her really existed. She's not a 10 like some of the other leading ladies but somehow her smile is warmer than Julia Roberts overdone overbite. If you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it. I assure you the trailer does not do it justice. They do not give away all the good jokes. Just some of the mediocre ones. Oh and one more thing. I hope critics put this on their top ten list. Many of them complain that comedies don't get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they don't put it on their list. This means you Ebert!!! 
 The selection of Sylvester Stallone to perform the protagonist by Renny Harlin is commendable since Stallone is that sort of tough and craggy person who had earlier rendered the requisite audaciously versatile aura to the characters of Rocky Balbao and Rambo. But to compare Die Hard series with Cliffhanger is a far-fetched notion. The excellently crafted opening scene introduces the audience to the thrill suspense and intrigue which is going to engulf them in the ensuing bloody and perilous encounter with the outlaws. The heist and the high altitude transfer of hard cash in suit cases from one plane to the other is something not filmed before. The biting cold of the snow capped Alps and the unfolding deceit and treachery among the antagonist forces makes one shiver with trepidation. The forces of awesome adventure and ruthless murder kicks the drama through to the end. Good movies are not made every year and people don't get a feast for eyes to watch every now and then. Apart from the filthy language/parlance which endows brazen excitement during certain scenes the movie can be regarded as one that is not going to fade its captivating appeal even watching it after so many years. 
 I'm not great at writing reviews so I'll just spout my opinions... I loved this series at first. The adventure the action the comedy the drama... I thought it was all brilliant. Anderson Tapping Shanks Judge Davis... I loved them all. Davis it seemed was the fifth-most important person in the cast. Not a big deal. But when his character (General Hammond) left at the end of the seventh season and Anderson's character (Colonel O'Neill) moved from the field to the office the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff. I don't know whether it's because Hammond was more important that I realized or what but for some reason after the seventh season the series turned to ****. The first seven seasons though were awesome. The movie Stargate seemed mediocre the first time I saw it but it turned out to be even if this wasn't the original intention a brilliant setup to the series. I recommend that you watch the movie first then watch the first season of the TV series then watch the movie again (you'll have a whole new appreciation of it the second time around believe me) and then watch the rest of the TV series. The last three seasons of the series aren't nearly as good as the first seven but that doesn't mean they aren't good. It just means they're a letdown if you've gotten spoiled by the first seven seasons. After you have finished this series be sure to watch the spin off series Stargate: Atlantis. It is a worthy successor to this brilliant series. EDIT on 7-18-08: I just found out that Don S. Davis died a few weeks ago. It is a great loss. 
 I believe that The Sopranos is an awesome show because of all the supporting characters in it. i have bought every video so far and am waiting for the rest to be released. In all 42 episodes so far the best one is definitely episode #3 Denial Anger Acceptance. This episode deals with my most favorite character of all time in The Sopranos. His name was Brendan Filone. He was killed for hijacking the wrong truck and accidentally killing a truck driver. Brendan was awesome because he was actually one of the few characters who actually stood against Tony and his gang. In the end he ended up getting shot through the eye while taking a bath and that's my most favorite scene ever in the history of The Sopranos. Brendan Filone is # 1 for me. And my # 2 most favorite character ever was Matthew Bevilaqua who was killed after attempting to murder Christopher Moltisanti. Tony and Pussy shoot him in Hucklebarney park after they catch and torture him. My # 3 most favorite character is Sean Gismonte who was killed right after shooting Christopher. And finally my # 4 most favorite character is Chucky Signore one of Uncle Junior's henchmen. He was killed on a boat by Tony. All the awesome characters are dead. That's the only bad thing about the Sopranos. All the cool guys always get killed. You know what would be great to change about the Sopranos? They should have a whole episode where they show all the dead supporting characters in hell and they are all trying to torture Chris Tony Uncle Junior Silvio and Paulie because they need to get their revenge. Brendan Filone shall strike back!!!!!!!!!1 
 I first saw this film as a young boy and recently purchased it on DVD. James Stewart brings great depth to the role of Chip Hardesty a hardworking and dedicated FBI agent. His life in the Bureau is intercut with his family life which is not all rosy. His wife (an excellent portrayal by Vera Miles) lives in fear of the dangerous nature of his job and they even separate for a time; Chip's best friend and fellow agent Sam Crandall (Murray Hamilton) is killed in a gunfight; Chip's son Mike enlists in the Marines during World War II. Through it all the family carries on with bravery and dignity. The action sequences are quite exciting and the semi-documentary style of the film works effectively. And the music by Max Steiner says it all; fidelity bravery and integrity. This country owes a great debt of gratitude to the men and women of the FBI and yes to J. Edgar Hoover as well. If Mr. Hoover's type of vigilance had been observed we might have been spared 9/11 the surge in crimes against children and many of the venal politicians we've had to put up with since his passing. 
 I had not seen this movie since the late '80s and decided to pick up the VHS version of it. The plot is very slow and the actors almost seem robotic in this breakdance flick. The music hip hop/freestyle artists and the breakdancing scenes are what make this movie special. The breakdancing is actually better in this movie than in Breakin' but I have to say that Breakin' 1&2 carry the energy & excitement to the screen a lot better. It's a movie I will keep in my library but it's not a movie that I can watch over & over again just once in a blue moon. 
 RKO had a reputation for making folksy homespun pieces of Americana. Anne Shirley (as Dawn O'Day) had been in films since she was a toddler. By 1933 she was in limbo - having played Ann Dvorak as a child in Three on a Match (1932) and a flower girl in both This Side of Heaven and The Key both in 1934. George Nicholls Jnr remembered Anne's work from a previous film and that's how she got this part. She also adopted Anne Shirley as her stage name. The memorable stories are there - Lady of Shallot in a leaky boat the stolen brooch the red hair incident. Anne was so right for the role of the chatty heartwarming orphan. She was heartbreaking in her intensity her eagerness to please and also her fiery temper. O.P. Heggie was wonderful as the understanding Matthew Cuthbert and Helen Westley was fine as the firm Marilla. Tom Brown was an excellent Gilbert Blythe. Gertrude Messinger who had also been in films as a small child was fine as Diana Barry. Sara Haden proved she could play someone other than Aunt Millie in the Andy Hardy series was Mrs. Barry. 
 After reading the comments to this movie and seeing the mixed reviews I decided that I would add my ten cents worth to say I thought the film was excellent not only in the visual beauty the writing music score acting and directing but in putting across the story of Joseph Smith and the road he traveled through life of hardship and persecution for believing in God the way he felt and knew to be his path. I am very pleased indeed to have had a small part in telling the story of this remarkable man. I recommend everyone to see this when the opportunity presents itself no matter what religious path he or she may be walking this only instills one with more determination to live the life that we should with true values of love and forgiveness as the Savior taught us to do. 
 Caught this film at the Arizona International Film Festival. I wasn't expecting a lot (though the festival's director told me it was one of the best films submitted). Five minutes into it I was sold. Shot in B & W on a shoestring budget this film is hilarious. The acting is solid the writing is solid and the look of the film is solid. The acting is probably the biggest revelation since most films shot on low budgets tend to have amateur or stagey acting. Not this one. It features one of the most convincing endearing and funny portrayals of a character with Tourette's Syndrome I've ever seen. The plot is convoluted without being confusing and raunchy without being gratuitous. If you get the chance see this movie. Filmmakers like Majkowski (hope I got that right) deserve the chance to strut their stuff to a wider audience. 
 While visiting Romania with his CIA dad Tony(Adam Arkin) quite a talented high school quarterback seen as the savior to lead his team finally to a victory over rival Simpson is told by a would-be palm-reader(..in Romania the people are not allowed many books so she took up palm reading)that he would be bitten by a werewolf( When the moon is full don't make any appointments..you will be busy. ). Well who would have thunk it..Tony is in fact bitten and his life would be forever changed. After his father unfortunately dies in a mishap within his bomb shelter(!)under odd circumstances(firing at his werewolf son inside a metallic bomb shelter isn't a very good idea especially if the bullet doesn't leave the room and bounces around like a pinball gone berserk) Tony travels the land through endless years until he's tired of packing and returns decades(..and many US Presidents)later to hopefully lead his football team to a win over Simpson..a task he abandoned long ago. What was once a very white clean-cut high school has indeed changed into a ghetto of drug use violence and perversion. To get an idea of what the early 80's Full Moon High school's prom party resembles think Studio 54 with teenagers.. Larry Cohen's parody of werewolf flicks among others things is crammed full of gags homages and in-jokes. My favorite sequences contain one in the sex-ed classroom where Tony reveals to the 80's class his werewolf transformation and the introductory scene to Dr. Brand(Alan Arkin who steals the film when Kenneth Mars isn't on screen) quite possibly the worst psychiatrist on Earth. His task to talk down a jumper leads to two men falling off a balcony..the jumper and a fireman (trying at first to talk him out of it) both fuming mad at Brand! Brand even tries to get Tony to sign a waver for his body's being donated to science so he can get his wife a fur coat! Kenneth Mars had me rolling in the floor as a homosexual football coach(..and later in the 80's as the Principal)who likes to pat his players on the behind..his scene where Tony's unloading the truth to the sex-ed class is classic. The film is loaded with inspired casting choices..just littered with funny characters and the cast interpretations..such as Ed McMahon as a very conservative military blowhard who actually looks identical to Joseph McCathy standing next to his photo in the bomb shelter(..always talking about commies) Joanne Nail as bulging eyed Ricky in present day who falls for the werewolf Elizabeth Hartman(A Patch of Blue)as a mousy nerdy sexually molested(..and molester)teacher who finds an attraction towards Tony James Dixon as a deputy(..his great scene has him stealing a line from his police chief reciting it to Dr. Brand who begins mouthing the words to himself for memorization) Roz Kelly as Jane an undyingly devoted female desiring Tony for only herself constantly demanding he ravish her and Bill Kirchenbauer as Flynn Tony's long-time pal and now the police chief who only got Jane after his friend left town. Can not forget JM J Bullock as Flynn's closeted gay son trying to fit in at the school hoping to find a dame with hilarious results. I like how the film pays homage to the werewolf genre such as when he's on the prowl..he's often referred to in the papers as Jack the Nipper because he likes to bite his victims on the cheek..and I'm not talking face. He's seen more as an annoyance than danger. The homages to Carrie and Psycho are nice and the violin shtick is also amusing. Cohen tosses so many zingers at the viewer eventually one has to stick. Obviously in a comedy such as this not every joke hits it's mark but many do. The cast makes this worthwhile. The film looks cheap on the typical Larry Cohen budget. Notice the 50's scenes where the obvious old cast members that would show up down the road wear glaring wigs. Loved Adam in the lead..he is the perfect foil for the gags that follow him and the zingers he lets fly from Cohen's script. The film moves quickly rarely catching a breath. I liked this horror comedy more than most it seems. 
 What a perfect example of Less Is More... Kurt Russell (Sgt. Todd) only has 72 lines and something like 104 words. What a challenge! Like a black and white photo when your mind's eye has to fill in the blanks the facial expressions the physical drama the emotive gesture all combines to make a stronger impact. This is one of those top 5 movies I can't live without right up there with the classics like Road Warrior. If you liked this check out Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior and Braveheart both starring Mel Gibson. Also Gladiator with Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen who was in Soldier also. The Thirteenth Warrior starring Antonio Banderas and Blade Runner starring Harrison Ford. 
 Ed Harris's work in this film is up to his usual standard of excellence that is he steals the screen away from anyone with whom he shares it and that includes the formidable Sean Connery. The movie which is more than a bit sanctimonious comes alive only in the scenes when Harris is interrogated by the attorney for another convict. It is breathtaking a master class in artistic control. The other cast members are all adept and Connery is reliable as is Fishbourne but the story itself packs no wallop. The plot depends largely on the premise that a black prisoner always will be mistreated and coerced by white law enforcement officers. This is the engine which drives the story right or wrong and makes one feel a tad cheated at the end. Still worth watching to see Harris in action. 
 Maybe I'm being too generous with the rating...but I just love this movie! I've seen it so many times but every time I see it I fall in love with it all over again. It's just a simple romantic comedy with nothing huge or monumentous that happens. But I'm a big romantic and this movie *is* romantic. I love Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins and Walter Mathau is so funny. The scientists make me laugh so much...I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. It's such a clean good movie - and those are so rare now! My 20-year-old brother likes this movie too so it's not just a chick-flick. ;-) I recommend it if you need to laugh or if you're just lonely and need to *watch* a romance if you yourself can't participate in one. It's a good 'un! 
 Jim Carrey shines in this beautiful movie. This is now one of my favorite movies. I read all about the making and I thought it was incredible how the did it. I can't wait till this comes out on DVD. I saw this in theaters so many times I can't even count how times I've seen it. 
 Man on fire is definitely one of the best drama/crime thrillers I have ever seen. Despite having a slow beginning the story is so amazingly complex and sensitive that it sticks together rather well. This is Denzel Washington's perfect role in which he plays a body guard called Creasy that is tormented by his past and is an alcoholic but never gives up on his duty to save his latest prot¨¦g¨¦e Pita. Dakota Fanning plays Pita the very smart enthusiastic little girl that loves so many things and acts in a very convincing manner she has a great future ahead of her. As I said the story is somewhat complicated in order to fully understand it you must watch it a couple of times. This film is made in two parts there's the first hour where everyone is happy nothing's wrong everyone's just living their lives happily until the kidnapping of Pita occurs and where Creasy is almost killed. And then there's the second part the rest of the film where suddenly everything becomes complicated and somewhat gruesome and disturbing when Creasy's recovered from his severe injury and starts chasing and killing the numerous criminals and La Hermamdad that were responsible for the planning and execution of the kidnapping of Pita. Denzel Washington shows us his most up to date acting talents alongside many other talented actors which have a great future ahead of them. It is a real shame that this film hasn't been acknowledged enough Washington really deserved another Oscar for his performance and so did Fanning and the director. And even maybe the visual effects which were of very high quality. If you like excellent slightly deranged suspenseful thrillers this is the one to see. The most amazing thing is that elements of this film are actually based on a real story and real characters! 10/10 
 Dream Quest was a surprisingly good movie. There were some noticeable goofs but that can be expected in a movie like this that was made in such a short time. I did not feel any urge to fast forward during the movie and I found it pretty entertaining. It gets kind of silly at times but overall I recommend it. They probably used up all the glitter in the nearby stores and some of the costume designs were pretty good. 
 One of the unsung gems of the 1980's Scenes... features razor-sharp satire and outstanding performances from Arnetia Walker (how did she not get a ton of roles after this?)and Wallace Shawn. It's a delicious send-up of class warfare and the people in those classes. The writing is hilarious and the characters while not subtle are nuanced. And sorry but the Asian gangs (if you can call one Japanese guy extorting one of the other characters a gang ) were not put in for sociological value as another review implies they should been. The value here lies in what the movie is making fun of and in the sparklingly wicked way it does it. I found it creative funny and idiosyncratic. 
 I have spent the last week watching John Cassavetes films - starting with 'a woman under the influence' and ending on 'opening night'. I am completely and utterly blown away in particular by these two films. from the first minute to the last in 'opening night' i was completely and utterly absorbed. i've only experienced it on a few occasions but the feeling that this film was perfect lasted from about two thirds in right through till the credits came up. everything about this film from the way it was shot the incredible performance of Gena Rowlands the credits the opening the music the plot the sense of depth the pace the tenderness the originality the characters the deft little moments.... for me is truly sublime. i couldn't agree more with the previous comment about taking it to a desert island because the sheer depth of this film is something to behold. if your unlucky enough to have a house fire i guarantee that instead of making a last ditch attempt to rescue that stash of money under your bed you'll be rescuing your copy of this film instead. 
 Some war movies succeed where others do not and that can be judged from a variety of angles. The humanistic angle one where you can feel the raw emotions (the terror of being under attack the camaraderie amongst soldiers the arduous trials people face inside them when in combat etc..) are always movies I find compelling. Movies like Das Boot and A Midnight Clear are but two examples of movies that you sense a connection to the characters in the film. This film succeeds on that level as well. It speaks of The Highest Honor and that honor is doing the right thing. These 23 soldiers did the right thing they had honor and it is recognized in a way wholly incompatible with Western thought but it is to the very end a true story of honor. Unforgettable movie. Based on the true story. 
 Wrapped in gorgeous English country backgrounds Emma is a delicious confection to be relished for dreamy getaways. Emma (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a graceful intelligent young woman who has just married off her governess--and confidant--to a marriage which Emma takes the credit in matchmaking. Eager to use her talent in arranging things for the people around her she decides to match the vicar Mr. Elton (Alan Cummings) with her pretty young friend Harriet (Toni Collette). The result is a series of mixed signals and mistaken interpretations that end up sorting themselves out with Emma learning that she did not have as much control over events as she thought. The film is full of Jane Austen's witty and wry characterizations. Gwyneth Paltrow is at her best portraying this maiden of a restrained polite society with wit and ease. Her growing romance with the unparalleled Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam) is the heart of this film. Mr. Knightley is one of the greatest romantic leading men in films. He is incredibly handsome in a modest relaxed way that is irresistible. He is certainly well-matched to Gwyneth Paltrow. Their charming friendship that began when he was 16 and she was an infant has blossomed as he a family friend matches wits with her in an older brotherly fashion that grows into something more. With a wry look or understated jab at Emma Northam's Knightley is a delight to watch. Other wonderful characterizations include the comic Juliet Stevenson Greta Scacchi Ewan McGregor Polly Walker and the talkative spinster Miss Bates who is very funny. Seeming shorter and more flowing than most Jane Austin adaptations Emma has comic rhythm that promises true enjoyment. 
 To Die For has it all.This film has a great cast. Lots and lots of romance and terror. Not too gory but still enough to appeal to horror fans. There are a lot more vampire love stories. If you are a fan of vampire love stories I strongly recommend this film-10/10. 
 I don't think most of us would tend to apply the term must-see to action films but I was very impressed at how good this film was and it deservedly gets the must-see stamp from me. Mandy played by Shannon Lee (daughter of the late and great Bruce Lee and sister of the late Brandon Lee) is recruited by Martin a professional thief to help pull off a diamond heist at a museum for a criminal syndicate and get rewarded handsomely for it. Little do they know that another pair of thieves (Lucy and Tommy a pair of lovebirds) who were spurned earlier by Mandy and Martin to get in on the deal are also planning to steal the diamond. How each pair of thieves plans out the heist is a thrill to watch. Things go awry as Martin and Mandy unknowingly find themselves a step behind Lucy and Tommy. You'll find yourself rooting for these thieves as they find that they need each other to stay alive from the crime syndicate who are not happy at all that the diamond is not in its hands. Action fans will not be disappointed as there's a healthy dose of gun battles martial arts and hand-to-hand combat sequences. What is surprising is that it's not just the action that carries this film but the romance and laughs (and I don't mean your typical one-liners prevalent in action films) that sneak in. It's not easy to root for bad guys but we get to see the human side of these thieves and the chemistry they develop. A great film and one NOT to miss! 9 out of 10 
 Watched both parts twice. Enjoyed the story and enjoyed seeing an older Patrick Swayze as the hero. He was very believable as the hunter Alan Quartermaine and certainly bested the performance of Richard Chamberlain. I do admit that I would have preferred seeing someone else as the Lady in Distress . Alison Doody should stick with modern and not period pieces. She didn't have the look of the woman of the 1800's. The rest of the cast were terrific and followed the plotlines very well. I am glad to see that the actors of this generation are not afraid to try on different characters and are not afraid to be seen as getting older. Age is inevitable but let's not hide from it. A man at 50+ can be much sexier (and Patrick truly is sexy) then a green youth no matter how pretty. Hoorah for character lines to go along with a great smile. 
 This is a delightful movie that is so over-the-top that my wife daughter and I found it irresistible. The plot is just crazy but rings true to the world of soap operas in all its outrageous improbabilities and impossibilities. I particularly enjoyed Kevin Kline's and Sally Field's performances. I don't anyone better than Kline at playing THICKheaded. Field's character's truly desperate need for attention and affirmation -- and her almost bipolar swings in mood -- played nicely against the background of Field's famous (infamous?) You like me! Oscar exclamation. People who can take themselves with such a large grain of salt are all too rare in this world. I think this is the only movie where I didn't find myself impatient with Whoopi Goldberg characterization; I thought she was spot on in every note she struck. Robert Downey Jr. Teri Hatcher Cathy Moriarty and Elizabeth Shue were also first-rate as well. Just a great movie if you're in the mood to go along for the ride and LAUGH! 
 Just as the new BSG wasn't what fans of the original series were expecting Caprica may not deliver what fans of the new BSG were expecting (for the most part). It is a very interesting if not somewhat self-involved show or at least the pilot is. If you're looking for the big CGI thrills of the (new) BSG you'll be sorely disappointed. If you liked the drama you'll probably find something you like and maybe even identify with. The storyline does examine on how the Cylons were developed why Adama hates them and the origins of a monotheistic society. The writers also manage to tackle humans 'playing God(s)' and the creation or re-creation of 'human' life. It will be interesting to see how this plays out. I found it to plod along in some parts and too preachy in others but all in all it was promising. A small part of me wishes (or hopes) there might be some minor inklings of BSG in there (aside from the back story I mentioned) but that would probably convolute the storyline too much. Like BSG I'll have to wait and see if Caprica grows on me but it's way too early to tell. It would really easy to chalk this up as a failure if you compare it to the previous series but I'm willing to give it a chance. Overall I thought it was interesting enough to make me see how the actual series is before 'throwing in the (proverbial) towel'. 
 Charleton Heston wore one James Franciscus wore one but Mark Wahlberg opts not to don the traditional loin cloth. I hope no one casts him as Tarzan. Linda Harrison wore a bikini in the first 2 Planet movies but Estrella Warren barely shows cleavage - her hair is always in the way. Tim Burton could have sexed up this simian saga & given the adults in the audience something to look at. Even the chaste Helena Bonham Carter never gets out of her costume which looks like a large curtain. She's cute but all the the love stuff is restricted to anxious looks & a little bitty kiss at the end. As in Artificial Intelligence which discusses inter species sex between robots & humans but never delivers - Planet of the Apes hints at inter species romance between the humans & the apes but only hints. Lisa Marie is the only ape that dares to be sexy. This movie has three great actors Tim Roth Ms. Carter & Paul Giamatti chewing up the scenery as a trio of apes & they are fun to watch. Superlative make up (a certain Oscar) costumes sets music make this the hit summer movie of 2001. 
 De Sica is becoming one of my favorite directors but this one was a hit-and-miss for me. A grinning idiot youth becomes the leader of a community of illegal settlers in a deserted area outside Milano. It is a detailed and sparkling story of the innocent poor masses complete with evil capitalists and trigger-happy police forces but slowly it evolves into a magic fantasy tale as the boy wonder Toto develops unlimited superhero powers. I had it up to here with the ever-smiling Toto after 10 minutes and when the magic took over I was left in the dust. There were so many wonderfully orchestrated shots so many good characters among the settlers that I kept thinking it was a waste the movie wasn't more serious with its material. The coupling of neorealism and fantasy comes out more as an experiment of the look-what-we-can-also-do-mum sort than as a fully developed piece of work/art. 
 This movie is about development. People growing and people fading people surprising and people disappointing. It has it all and more. There is hope frustration injustice justice love and hate. It is truly a classic drama that has fantastic performances from the whole cast but especially Whoopi Goldberg in her debut role. This movie made me feel very human and proud of it and I suggest that this movie should be mandatory each Saturday in all prisons in the world - it touches your compassion. Rating: 10 of 10. PS: I admit it: I shed a tear of joy during the final scene. 
 I have seen Maslin Beach a couple of times - both on free to air TV in Brisbane. I won't go into whether it is good bad or otherwise as others have well and truly covered this. I will say that it is so Australian. Only in Australia can we have a film about relationships among people spending the day as naked as the day they were born and to view it on free commercial television. I have a friend from the US who is constantly amazed at what we put on our free TV compared to her home country. Sex and the CIty and Huff are just too examples. Despite our Government trying to turn us into the 51st US State it is good to know at least some things remain truly Aussie 
 New York I Love You is a collective work of eleven short films with each segment running around 10 minutes long. The shorts don't exactly relate but they all have something in common love. Every short is about finding love either if it's about a couple or just two strangers chitchatting.The film stars an ensemble cast among them Shia LaBeouf Natalie Portman Hayden Christensen Orlando Bloom Chris Cooper Andy Garcia Christina Ricci Irrfan Khan Robin Wright Penn Julie Christie Ethan Hawke Bradley Cooper Rachel Bilson and Anton Yelchin. With such a stellar cast and such an interesting premise I was expecting a tremendous film; the problem is New York I Love You doesn't add up. It remains the sum of its parts. Some of the segments are funny original and interesting but others are so meaningless (Orlando Bloom/Christina Ricci and Ethan Hawke/Maggie Q segments) that it's appalling. The film is definitely uneven and has a very experimental tone. Story-wise it seems like something a few film students could put together. Having said that the film has some great moments as well one of the best being the segment about an old couple played by Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman walking along in Brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary. And it's moments like this that made me as a viewer wish the film was more consistent because there's a lot of potential here. But as unsatisfying as the overall story ends up being for me the cinematography and soundtrack saved the all thing. The editing was perfect the way the film was shot was very impressive and the ethereal soundtrack couldn't be more fitting. In the end New York I Love You feels like an experimental film and as in most experiences there's highs and lows. It's how one looks at the film as a whole that will determine if he enjoys it or not. It might be worthwhile for some and a waste of time for others. 7/10 
 L'Hypoth¨¨se du tableau vol¨¦/The Hypothesis of the Stolen Painting (1979) begins in the courtyard of an old three-story Parisian apartment building. Inside we meet The Collector an elderly man who has apparently devoted his life to the study of the six known existing paints of an obscure Impressionist-era painter Tonnerre. A narrator recites various epigrams about art and painting and then engages in a dialogue with The Collector who describes the paintings to us shows them to us tells us a little bit about the painter and the scandal that brought him down and then tells us he's going to show us something.... As he walks through a doorway we enter another world or worlds or perhaps to stretch to the limits other possible worlds. The Collector shows us through his apparently limitless house including a large yard full of trees with a hill; within these confines are the 6 paintings come to life or half-way to life as he walks us through various tableaux and describes to us the possible meanings of each painting of the work as a whole of a whole secret history behind the paintings the scandal the people in the paintings the novel that may have inspired the paintings. And so on and so on. Every room every description leads us deeper into a labyrinth and all the while The Collector and The Narrator engage in their separate monologues very occasionally verging into dialogue but mostly staying separate and different. I watched this a second time so bizarre and powerful and indescribable it was and so challenging to think or write about. If I have a guess as to what it all adds up to it would be a sly satire of the whole nature of artistic interpretation. An indicator might be found in two of the most amusing and inexplicable scenes are those in which The Collector poses some sexless plastic figurines -- in the second of them he also looks at photos taken of the figurines that mirror the poses in the paintings -- then he strides through his collection which is now partially composed of life-size versions of the figures. If we think too much about it and don't just enjoy it it all becomes just faceless plastic.... Whether I've come to any definite conclusions about L'Hypoth¨¨se du tableau vol¨¦ or not I can say definitely that outside of the early (and contemporaneous) works of Peter Greenaway like A Walk Through H I've rarely been so enthralled by something so deep so serious so dense....and at heart so mischievous and fun. 
 Well well....Roeg touched a bit of a nerve there didn't he? He was a genius while he was cataloguing his various characters' descents into psychosis for a couple of decades but as soon as he has the bad taste to suggest that redemption (or even some good advice) might be found in the bad old Catholic church the hipper-than-thou alternative movie crowd gets extra vicious. Worse still Theresa Russell's character - faced with experiences that nothing in her avowedly rationalist outlook has an explanation for is unwillingly forced to deal with those experiences on another level - that of the spiritual. You know the realm of the ignorant and superstitious the sort of thing that the art-house cinephiles are supposed to be above. Oh the horror... So she finds her marriage - the idea that it might be a uniquely important commitment - affirmed by what seems uncomfortably like divine intervention. People who find this idea prima facie offensive could maybe ask themselves why they instinctively jump into attack mode at being challenged to take seriously the idea of a spiritual dimension to their lives. But they probably won't. Sure this film has some problems notably Talia Shire's delirious hamwork as the overwrought nun 1950s-style attire and all. And the dialogue between Marie Davenport and the young priest in their last scene is straight out of the Spellbound School of Glib Interpretations (though Hitchcock's movie escaped similar charges due to the source of wisdom having impeccably secular credentials as a Freudian psychoanalyst). But sadly Nicolas Roeg appears to have copped a critical mauling as much for even asking the question as for the possible answers this film presents. 
 This is an Oriental fantasy about ¡§thousand and one Arabian nights¡§ plenty of incredible adventures fantasy witchery and wizardly. The malignant vizier Jaffar (magnificently played by Conrad Veidt)with powerful magic faculties imprisons the prince Ahamad of Bagdad(attractive John Justin)who loses his throne then he escapes thanks a little thief named Abu(sympathetic Sabu). They arrive Basora where Ahamad and the princess(gorgeous June Duprez) fall in love. But prince and thief are haunted by Jaffar Ahamd is turned blind and Abu is become a dog. The story accumulates several fantastic ingredients such as transformation of the starring a flying mechanic horse magic bow flying carpet and of course the colossal genie(overacting performed by Rex Ingram) who gives three wishes to Sabu the magic eye the figure of goddess Kali with several hands among others. This remarkable picture ranks as one of the finest fantastic films of all time. Produced by London Fim's Alexander Korda and directed by the definitively credited Ludwing Berger Michael Powell and Tim Whelan with a stunning screenplay by Lajos Biro and Miles Malleson also dialogs writer and actor as Sultan fond to mechanic games. The WWII outbreak caused the paralyzing shooting then the three Korda brothers and collaborators traveled USA continuing there the filming in especial on Grand Cannon Colorado.The splendid visual and glimmer Technicolor cinematography setting and FX provoked the achieving three Oscars : Production design by William Cameron Menzies and Vincent Korda Cinematography by George Perinal and Special effects by Osmond Borradaile though today are dated and is urgent a necessary remastering because the colors are worn-out. Furthermore one nomination for the evocative and oriental musical score by Miklos Rozsa. This vivid tale with immense doses of imagination will like to fantasy fans and cinema classic buffs 
 Bela Lugosi gets to play one of his rare good guy roles in a serial based upon the long running radio hit (which was also the source of a feature film where Lugosi played the villain.) Lugosi cuts a fine dashing figure and its sad that he didn't get more roles where he could be the guy in command in a good way. Here Chandu returns from the East in order to help the Princess Nadji who is being hunted by the leaders of the cult of Ubasti who need her to bring back from the dead the high priestess of their cult. This is a good looking globe trotting serial that is a great deal of fun. To be certain the pacing is a bit slack more akin to one of Principals (the producing studios) features then a rip roaring adventure but it's still enjoyable. This plays better than the two feature films that were cut from it because it allows for things to happen at their own pace instead of feeling rushed or having a sense that hey I missed something . One of the trilogy of three good serials Lugosi made the others being SOS Coast Guard and Phantom Creeps 
 This is the moving tale of Scotland's legendary hero Rob Roy and his battles with the feudal landowners. Like Braveheart to which it is frequently compared it is not very historical. Despite their primarily fictional nature I rate both of these movies highly and would be hard pressed to choose between the two. The 13 Century William Wallace is as others have noted a larger than life national figure while the early 18th Century Rob Roy comes across as an honourable but ordinary Scotsman. The story revolves around a clan chieftain Robert Roy McGregor who lives in a Scottish highland cottage with his wife Mary and their two young sons. As the movie begins he and his fellow clansmen are hunting down some thieves who have stolen the local lord's cattle. Rob Roy then wishes to improve the living conditions of his people so arranges to borrow one thousand Scottish pounds from a local noble the Marquis of Montrose in order to buy cattle to herd to market. He temporarily entrusts this money to his friend Alan McDonald. When both McDonald and the money turn up missing Rob Roy finds himself in conflict with Montrose as well as his despicable prot¨¦g¨¦ Archibald Cunningham and his sleazy factor Killearn. Rob Roy's honour is also tested when Montrose seeks to involve him in false testimony against his rival the Duke of Argyle whom he wishes to accuse of being a Jacobite. The charismatic Liam Leeson is brilliant as the kilted highlander Rob Roy an intelligent virile and noble hero and a man whose sense of honour is pivotal to this tale. Personally I feel that this is Neeson's best performance his brogue (albeit Irish) adding authenticity for the average viewer. Rob Roy is a stubborn proud courageous and honest man whose word can be trusted. He is a loving husband & father and also touchingly loyal to his friend McDonald who is accused of robbing him. Tim Roth masterfully portrays his major adversary and surely one of the most heinous and sadistic cinematic villains Archibald Cunningham an egotistical ruthless strutting peacock. He is very effeminate for someone who makes it his major business to ravish the local women whether willing or otherwise. The pathetic Cunningham himself constantly refers to the fact that he is a bastard unaware of his own father's identity though this hardly justifies his horrendous misdeeds of murder rape and thievery. Also he mercilessly casts aside the young servant girl Betty after she becomes pregnant with his child resulting in her suicide. John Hurt plays the arrogant and foppish Montrose who is eventually implied to be Cunningham's father. The movie is essentially the very believable love story between an ordinary man and his wife beautifully depicting the passionate relationship between Rob Roy and Mary. Those who question the presence of passion within marriage should watch this husband and wife! I think the phrase used by this pair 'How fine you are to me...' is surely one of the most beautiful expressions of love in all cinema. The most compelling performance is possibly by Jessica Lange as Rob's wife Mary McGregor. Lacking make up she has the pretty but natural look of a sturdy peasant wife and mother. The actress brings great courage and dignity to her role when she is brutally raped by the despicable Cunningham while the disgusting Killearn looks on. Her dialogue is plain spoken but filled with pride and grace. I give Hollywood its due that for once they showed just enough in the rape scene to reveal its cruelty as well as Mary's pain and humiliation but nothing intended to sensationalize. Their kinsman Alastair McGregor shows emotional anguish when he learns of Mary's rape and further torment when she swears him to secrecy never to reveal to her husband her violation by Cunningham. Of course this film features the beautiful scenery of the Scottish highlands also lavish period costumes and appropriate musical scoring. There are no grand battle scenes as in Braveheart but continuous engaging action and a particularly gripping sword fight in the final duel between Rob Roy and Cunningham. This is a captivating movie featuring both tense action and a beautiful love tale. 
 Well this might be one of the funniest movies of all time and Sandy gives a tour-de-force performance! Alas her career never quite took off but - at last - she will always be remembered for her three first-rate pictures: The King Of Comedy Dallas Doll and Without You I'm Nothing . She dons into different personas from New York socialite to Diana Ross to create a biting and hilarious critique of popular culture in America. Sexy and fierce tender and sensual philosophical and melancholic she convinces the audience in every scene and she actually IS really pretty . Watch this one (if you're not from Iowa) you'll certainly enjoy it!! 
 Hello Dave Burning Paradise is a film for anyone who likes Jackie Chan and Indiana Jones. The films main protagonist is most definitely the bastard son of these two strange fathers. As for the other characters well they are familiar transformations of similar action film stereotypes. Where this film is original is in the blending of the traditional Hong Kong movie style with the Hollywood action adventure. Sadly this has not been true of the films he has made in Hollywood. 
 Any one who has seen Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ and was bothered by the gory violence would want to see this film instead. Though it wasn't a success in th box office or TV ratings The Fox Movie Channel still finds a real good motive to show this anually. I liked the way that they trained Chris Sarandon and the men who portrayed his disciples to sing in Hebrew.Though Sarandon didn't have long hair like any other Jesus would in other films his looks are pretty close to what a Jewish man would appear. What surprised me or startled me was the scene where Caiaphas told Jesus about Pilate And don't ever forget that you are a Jew! Though that may have not been a racist remark Colin Blakely was trying to make Chris Sarandon look like garbage in the eyes of the prominent men of those days.Keith Michell's portrayal of Pilate was hulking comparing with his previous performances in The Story of Jacob and Joseph and The Story of David . But if you compare his portrayal of Pilate with Telly Savala's or Hurd Hatfield you can say that he really painted well the impression of a Roman procurator. 
 Having looked at some of the other comments here I have a main complaint with this presentation. The two primary characters are attractive in their own ways - the beautiful victim and the handsome obviously extremely off-center blue-collar protagonist (if just short of totally-deranged ) - take turns beating the hell out of each other sort of like a Caucasian Kabuki scenario. This is all right and this is of course mainly a turning-the-tables story. However my referenced complaint is that I believe the director got caught-up in his desire to display Farrah's well-known and obvious physical attributes. Beginning with her being enticingly clad in a thin robe and with a number of scenes displaying more than needed for any dramatic effect - while immensely pleasing to the eyes these distract from the poignancy level of the drama. Her roommates I'm certain give performances as written and directed - however their respective skepticism and histrionic babbling and sobbing don't ring true -- based upon Farrah's previous experience with this guy the obvious evidence of his having come to their premises with only the worst of intentions and that she would have absolutely no grounds to be exaggerating what has occurred. But this is a film and story compelling as much in spite of as because of the director's work. 
 Like TALK RADIO THE BOOTH is actually kinda predictable (TALK RADIO because we know the truth of what happened going in THE BOOTH because of- let's face it- the genre and the basic set-up). That's not necessarily a bad thing in this case. It means in essence that the filmmakers don't punk out in the end the way they might've in say an American version of this story. THE BOOTH moves inexorably toward its (foregone) conclusion but is so beautifully crafted on every level that one can enjoy the ride the way one might a familiar cruise along a well-travelled stretch of (very scenic) road. It reminds me of Harlan Ellison's spooky short story FLOP SWEAT. The claustrophobia is at times almost palpable. Worth a nice long look. 
 Once a year comes a movie like that and makes things easy for you. You don't have make an effort to think it is good it's just is. You enjoy it while you watch it and you take it home with you. I can't say it is totally flawless but it's near. Acting - great story -interesting and with elements of suspense. It's a small family story pretty much predictable but it's not the secret itself that matters. it is the way the it takes the blind girl to reach it. I was impressed by the way the director portrayed their deep relationship (the blind girl and her cousin). The only thing I didn't like that much is the actress that played the mother she was too tough and without necessity. Keren 
 While I don't consider myself a big fan of fairy tale movies Stardust intrigued me based on seeing Michelle Pfeiffer in the trailers as a villain (especially since I was about to see her as the bossy Velma Von Tussle in Hairspray). Boy is she so convincingly evil here as a witch especially with her age-ugly makeup in the beginning and end! Robert De Niro is also great as the pirate captain who's forced to hide in the closet to protect his reputation ! Just about all the actors like Claire Danes Rupert Everett Ricky Gervais Peter O'Toole and many others do fine work here. While Danes and Pfeiffer are classic beauties there's also stunning faces of Sienna Miller Olivia Grant (as Girl Bernard) and Kate Magowan especially when we first meet her. Newcomer Charlie Cox is fine as the lead Tristan and he looked so much like his father Dunstan as a young man that I thought that was him in early scenes with Magowan (actually Ben Barnes). Many comments have compared this to The Princess Bride and while I can see some resemblances the main difference was that with PB you always knew it was just an imaginary tale as told by an old man to his grandson. Stardust makes you believe for the most part that what you're seeing and hearing could have actually happened even with all the hilarity that happens throughout. So on that note I highly recommended Stardust. 
 A group of model-caliber San Francisco women who have been friends since elementary school are suddenly being threatened and attacked by someone sending them bizarre Valentine's Day cards. Who is the killer and why is the killer after them? My rating will often change on subsequent viewings of a film--sometimes slightly up sometimes slightly down. However I can't remember another film where my rating has changed as drastically as it has for Valentine. The first time I watched it upon its theatrical release I thought it was pretty awful--I gave it a 4 out of 10 the equivalent of an F letter grade. Watching it for a second time last night I can't remember what the heck I didn't like about it. I can only assume that maybe I was really in the wrong mood to watch it or maybe I just didn't get it. In any event I loved it this time giving it a 9 out of 10 or an A . It might sound ridiculous saying I didn't get a film like this but there is something to get. Valentine is almost a comedy/horror. Director Jamie Blanks who was also responsible for 1998's Urban Legend takes the stereotypical teen horror formula that became so popular in the late 1990s in the wake of Scream (1996) and pushes most of the elements up a notch making Valentine intentionally cheesy/campy almost to the point of absurdity (where absurdism is a positive stylistic term). On top of that he gives us a film imbued with humorous commentary on romantic relationships. The humor is unusual in that it has the same exaggeratedly campy tone as the teen horror aspects. Most of the situations in the film and the modus operandi of the villain humorous or not are tied in to the Valentine's Day theme. Many viewers will likely subtract points from the film for its various clich¨¦-rooted but implausible scenarios and plot developments. However in light of the above the film is intentionally clich¨¦d implausible and ludicrous. It's as if Blanks is attempting (and mostly succeeding) to transcend the typical teen slasher by mocking/spoofing the conventions of the genre while also satirizing eros. That's the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on Valentine's Day. It's an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre making it prime fodder for Valentine's extravagant lampooning. Scream had a similar aim with its horror material but the twist there was that the film was self-aware . Valentine's Day is intentionally not self-aware; the viewer has to rely on contextual clues for satire. Lest some think I'm reading too much into the film it's worthwhile to note that Blanks said in interviews that he didn't want to just do another slasher film after Urban Legend and producer Dylan Sellers said he wanted to do something more adult . Other viewers may dislike the fact that Valentine's Day differs so much from its putative source material the novel of the same name by Tom Savage. The novel's characters setting and plot are very different from the film. Sellers has said While it was a fine book I didn't think it was the right story for a film . So instead the novel which is much dryer and more serious in tone was used as a launching pad a motif to create variations on for a horror/thriller story centered on Valentine's Day. While those facts won't help purists familiar with the book like the film it's helpful to understand why the film has its divergent plot and attitude. It's probably better to look at the film as an independent entity with a similar theme. Blanks' direction is impeccable visually. Valentine's Day has a lush look throughout with complex deep colors interesting sets and good staging. Blanks is admirable for keeping his villain and attack scenes not too dark with clearly conveyed action. He also directs his actors with aplomb catalyzing often slyly humorous performances. David Boreanaz as Adam Carr is involved in many of the funniest moments. While Valentine's Day is no masterpiece it's a very good horror/thriller film that seems strongly prone to misconceptions. If you watch it expecting something more tongue-in-cheek you may find yourself appreciating it a lot more. 
 I know some people think the movie is boring but I disagree. It is a biography of a very complex and extraordinary person. I liked the characters in the film and think that leaving parts of Archie's life a mystery captured his humanity. I don't think the purpose of a good biography should be the detailing of someone's life but rather the complexities and relationships that make them interesting. And what is more fascinating than someone so successfully reinventing themselves? Men become what they dream - you have dreamed well. Good job to Lord Attenborough. I also wanted to mention that Nathaniel Arcand really stood out to me as a charismatic actor and I hope to see him in more films. 
 Producer Joel Schumacher who also directed Phone Booth '02 and many other great films showed in great detail how no one person can really be trained to be a killing machine with out destroying their own personalities and the real fears that a person has to face when going into COMBAT!! Colin Farrell(Roland Bozz) Intermission '03 gave one of his best performances and actually carried this entire picture on his back. Matthew Davis(Jim Paxton) Blue Crush '02 gave a great supporting role and Shea Whigham(Pvt.Wilson) All The Real Girls '03 showed his true acting skills in the role that he played. There was two brief scenes where the soldiers were able to find some hot romance on a short leave in the local town and had to pay for their love and sexual desires. One Army Veteran instructor from Viet Nam told the soldiers how to really torture the enemy by using electrical wires in all the wrong places on a human male body. Enjoyable and entertaining film to view. 
 AG was an excellent presentation of drama suspense and thriller that is so rare to American TV. Sheriff Lucas gave many a viewer the willies. We rooted for Caleb as he strove to resist the overtures of Sheriff Lucas. We became engrossed and fearful upon learning of the unthinkable connection between these two characters. The manipulations which weekly gave cause to fear what Lucas would do next were truly surprising. This show lived up to the Gothic moniker in ways American entertainment has so seldom attempted much less mastered. The suits definitely made a big mistake in not supporting this show. This show puts shame to the current glut of reality shows- which are so less than satisfying viewing.The call for a DVD box set is well based. This show is quality viewing for a discerning market hungry for quality viewing. A public that is tiring of over-saturation of mind-numbing reality fare will welcome this gem of real storytelling. Bring on the DVD box set!! 
 Audiard made here a very interesting movie. It begins with the description of an almost-deaf young woman in its working universe as a secretary; she is ignored frustrated rejected... Hiring an intern as an assistant appears to be a way for her to find someone in her life : but the guy is just coming out from jail. Their both being rejected by the society reunites them progressively. Characters'description is profund goes into details...both start to help each other; for she can read on lips which reveals itself to be very useful for him...She will progressively evolve far from what she was at first. It's beautifully filmed; the whole is very convincing even if it turns into a film noir at the end. Gesture is in particular beautifully observed in Audiard's filming. Emmanuelle Devos should be nominated at the Best Actess Cesar Awards for her magistral play. Action towards the end of the film prevents it from being a simple etude de moeurs . It's actually surprisingly entertaining : 8/10. 
 ERROL FLYNN had one of his favorite roles as the brash braggart from a fighting Irish family who went on to become the heavyweight champion of the world at a time when John L. Sullivan (WARD BOND) went around claiming that he could beat any man alive. Both Flynn and Ward Bond give what is probably among the best performances they ever gave on screen. Raoul Walsh has directed the colorful tale with robust style capturing the family life as well with scenes that are warm-hearted and full of good humor. All the Warner contract players make up the fine cast--including the always reliable ALAN HALE as Flynn's rambunctious father proud of his son's fighting abilities and ALEXIS SMITH who makes the most of her role as a feisty society girl who enjoys taking Flynn down a peg with saucy one-liners dealing with his conceited manners. All of the 1880s atmosphere is captured in glorious B&W although it's too bad Warners didn't have more faith in Flynn to do the film in color. He was entering a rocky phase of his film career at the time engaged in a widely publicized rape trial that had all of the tabloids busy sorting things out. The fighting scenes are among the best ever choreographed for the screen with Flynn obviously in fine form and making very little use of doubles for most of the action. And the scene where Bond turns over his award plaque to Flynn at a social gathering is one of Ward's finest moments in a long career as a character actor. Summing up: Maintains interest all the way through whether you're a sports fan or not. 
 Another small piece of the vast picture puzzle of the Holocaust is turned face up in this docudrama about the Rosenstrasse Protest in Berlin an event I had not known of that began in late February 1943. The details are given in an addendum that follows this review. The film narrative sets the story of this protest within another contemporary story that begins in New York City in the present. Here a well off non-observant Jewish woman whose husband has just died shocks her children and others by insisting on an extremely orthodox mourning ritual. She goes even further demanding that her daughter's non-Jewish fianc¨¦ leave the house. The distressed daughter Hannah (Maria Schrader) then learns for the first time from an older cousin that during WWII in Berlin her mother then 8 years old had been taken in and protected by an Aryan woman. Hannah drops everything goes to Berlin and finds this woman Lena Fischer now 90. Hannah easily persuades the woman to tell her story. It all seems rather too pat. The film thereafter improves focusing through long flashbacks primarily on the events of 1943 that surrounded the protest in which the fictitious central character is the same Mrs. Fischer at 33 (played magnificently by Katja Riemann) a Baroness and accomplished pianist who is married to Fabian (Martin Feifel) a Jewish concert violinist one of the men detained at the Rosenstrasse site. The narrative does briefly weave back to the present from time to time and also ends in New York City once again. While scenes in the present are color saturated the 1943 scenes are washed out strong on blue-gray tones. The quality of acting is generally quite good what we might expect given the deep reservoir of talent in Germany and the direction of Margarethe von Trotta New German Cinema's most prominent female filmmaker herself a former actress. The story of the protest is told simply. Only one feature is lacking that would have helped: still-text notes at the end indicating the eventual outcome for those people taken into custody at Rosenstrasse an outcome that was as the addendum below makes clear incredibly positive. Rosenstrasse has not fared well in the opinions of most film critics. Overly long needlessly layered purveyor of gender stereotypes manipulative with music: so go the usual raps. It is too long. But I found in this film an austere powerful spontaneous and entirely convincing voice of protest from the women who kept the vigil outside the place on Rosenstrasse where their Jewish relatives and others were detained. I found nothing flashy contemporary or manipulative in this depiction. The very absence of extreme violence (no one is shot or otherwise physically brutalized) intensified my tension which increased incrementally as the film progressed. You keep waiting for some vicious attack to begin any minute. The somberness of the film stayed with me afterward. I awoke often later in the night I saw the film my mind filled with bleak melancholic chaotic images and feelings conjured by the film. For me that happens rarely. (In German and English). My rating: 8/10 (B+). (Seen on 05/31/05). If you'd like to read more of my reviews send me a message for directions to my websites. Add: The Rosenstrasse Protest: Swept up from their forced labor jobs in what was meant to be the Final Roundup in the national capital 1700 to 2000 Jews mostly men married to non-Jewish women were herded into Rosenstrasse 2-4 a welfare office for the Jewish community in central Berlin. Because these Jews had German relatives many of them highly connected Adolf Eichmann hoped that segregating them from other prisoners would convince family members that their loved ones were being sent to labor camps rather than to more ominous destinations in occupied Poland. Normally those arrested remained in custody for only two days before being loaded onto trains bound for the East. But before deportation of prisoners could occur in this case wives and other relatives got wind of what was happening and appeared at the Rosenstrasse address first in ones and twos and then in ever-growing numbers. Perhaps as many as six thousand participated in the protest although not all at the same time. Women demanded back their husbands day after day for a week. Unarmed unorganized and leaderless they faced down the most brutal forces at the disposal of the Third Reich. Joseph Goebbels the Gauleiter (governor or district leader) of Berlin anxious to have that city racially cleansed was also in charge of the nation's public morale. On both counts he was worried about the possible repercussions of the women's actions. Rather than inviting more open dissent by shooting the women down in the streets and fearful of jeopardizing the secrecy of the Final Solution Goebbels with Hitler's concurrence released the Rosenstrasse prisoners and even ordered the return of twenty-five of them who already had been sent to Auschwitz! To both Hitler and Goebbels the decision was a mere postponement of the inevitable. But they were mistaken. Almost all of those released from Rosenstrasse survived the war. The women won an astonishing victory over the forces of destruction. (Adapted from an article posted at the University of South Florida website A Teacher's Guide to the Holocaust. ) 
 I bellied up to the bar expecting this to be a hot beer on a sweltering Texas day but was pleasantly surprised. After suffering through Saturday Night Foolishness I had no desire to see a re-make in some south Texas barnyard....and I didn't. John Revolta was good as the jealous redneck Scott Glenn was well cast as a thuggie ex-con and Debra Winger was as always a delight. *Love that woman* Plus the soundtrack was dynamite [and this comes from a guy that can't stand the sound of country music]. A fun film all the way. 
 I know it is fashionable now to hate this movie. I have seen hundreds of spook films including he original 1963 Haunting as well as most of the Hammer films. This film is not restrained and does not hold back at all which is probably why so many modern viewers seemed not to like it. Yet many viewers can accept out of control films like Scream because knife killers are more easy to believe for most people than demons or ghosts. Actually this film had many great scenes and the acting and special effects were great. I have seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time. The director of this film has made a number of interesting and stylish films and was not trying for the type of realism of the 6th sense. The Haunting lets go and is certainly not boring. Perhaps this film might appeal more to John Carpenter fans but more of an traditional plot structure. The old Haunting was also a fine film from 1963. It was even more scary. See both and also The Innocents and The Legend of Hell House with Pamela Franklin. 
 I watched the presentation of this on PBS in the U.S. when it originally aired in 1988 (?). Assuming the miniseries was available on DVD I purchased first editions of all three books last year. Since then I have been searching for the series on internet movie sites. Today I found this web site. I will give up the search. I too would like to buy this complete - 26 episodes - miniseries. After buying the DVDs I would read each book then watch the episodes for that book. That is what I did with John LeCarre's Karla trilogy and Larry McMurty's Texas ranger trilogy. Does anyone have any suggestions for great books or book series that became very good TV miniseries - or movie series - that are now available on DVD? 
 This is the one movie to see if you are to wed or are a married couple. The movie portrais a couple in Italy and deals with such difficult topics as abortion infidelity juggling work and family. The so called culture of death that we are experiencing nowadays in the world is terrible and this movie will surely make you think. A must see. I hope it gets distributed as it should. Congratulations on the cast and director. Two thumbs up and a 10 star evaluation from me! 
 i watched this movie 10 years ago. and have watched it on video an average of once a year since. it's the type of movie that's timeless because the themes are universal yet the stories and conversation are so personal. it's also one of the very few movies that capture you from frame one til the credits roll despite the fact that there are really just two (very involving) characters. this owes a lot to the engaging acting by hawke and delpy who make us believe that they are actually jesse and celine. this is also the first movie i saw that mentioned reality TV and now the phenomenon is rampant! i love the way this movie just envelops the audience in its space and makes you think however jaded you may be that you are one of those characters. it also made me want to ride the train around Europe! i have not met anyone who has not been able to relate to this movie. maybe that speaks about myself my friends or just the sheer genius of this movie. 
 Sometimes you have to look back to go forward. The 60's did just that. We need to remember the past. The past is part of the future. Great mix Gary J. Coppola. I see a great future. You deserve to be nominated and win The 60's best mixer of the year. Best mini-series of all times. Thanks Ursula 
 Most reviews say that this is the weakest point in Hamilton's short movie career. This movie is a bit different from the rest and considering it the best or the worst depends on what you expect from a movie and what you expect from Hamilton. Knowing Hamilton as a photographer you can be slightly surprised. While Bilitis looks like his books in a movement with all those young girls discovering themselves and relations with each other on the edge of lesbian with a plot connecting these scenes Laura concentrates on few characters what enables developing relations among them (male-female artist-model) but though we see beautiful photos many of them better than his average their number is reduced for the sake of the plot. Tendres cousines is different from both it is only Hamilton's movie that looks more like a film than like a collection of moving photos. Because of that it can be acceptable to wider audience than Hamilton's fans looking like an erotic comedy (but not German soft-core type - Schulm?dchen report fans would be very disappointed). You won't laugh a lot but you can smile (and that's something you don't often get from Hamilton). Unlike all other Hamilton's movies the age of female varies. Unlike other movies main character is a boy. Unlike his usual works this one isn't put out of place and out of time. We have characters that live their life have their destiny and don't lead us only from one photo to another from one nude girl to another. Unfortunately Hamilton (again) gets lost with a script in his hands. Girls on beaches under shower in low-light rooms in gardens under tents in front of mirrors regardless of the amount of clothes - this is his territory he can shoot minutes and hours and whatever he does you'll always feel the artist's eye and hand behind it. But when he has to present us average everyday life he stops being Hamilton and becomes average director who just follows the script. Hamilton is best known for his nudes but they are just a part of his work. And in Tendres cousines we have a reverse situation: his girls are not in the best shots. Nature garden house remind us on Hamilton's work (often neglected part of it) while girls even when nude don't have anything special in the way he presents us. Maybe Hamilton was confused having a boy in front of camera maybe he was thinking about a line that censorship would accept maybe he was really trying to make something new (and no one dared to tell him he shouldn't) but he neglected what he was mostly praised for. 
 I recommend watching this film with your significant other if you're planning a romantic evening with him/her. The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is so steamy it could fog up your screen. After the original film we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other. Jane's skimpy jungle wear and Tarzan's protest when Jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically but also quite sexually in love. One's imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between Tarzan & Jane to portray how much Jane is actually teaching Tarzan about love emotionally romantically and sexually. And Jane's student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality. The skin show in this film is off the charts. In addition to Jane's two-piece sexy midriff leg and hip baring costume she also has an underwater nude swim with Tarzan. (although it is not O'Sullivan but Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim who doubles for her in this scene) Weissmuller also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in his barely there loincloth. The ladies will delight when Weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell - with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hips. It's a shame that the over-protective censors toned down the adult nature of the Tarzan films after this entry. Although the Weissmuller Tarzan films would still prosper in the years to come they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie. 
 Oh my gosh i live in Kentucky and when Mellisa Joan hart came to Louisville she went right through my neighborhood and waved at me i am filthy rich so she wanted to look at my neighborhood oh and i Love being rich any ways she came for the Derby back to my interest in the show...... that show makes you want to point your finger at something and make it disappear i mean it is just so creative and i love it i would love to be on that show....... that show is just amazing i mean who ever came up with that show i want to just give them a big kiss i mean it makes me feel better when I'm sick and makes me happy when I'm mad i mean if someone tells me they don't like it i will talk some sense in to you OK OK 
 Well I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was funny and sad and yes the guy Andie MacDowell shagged was hot. Interesting realistic characters and plots as well as beautiful scenery. I think my Mum would like it. I still think they should have been allowed to call it the Sad F**kers Club though... 
 Princess Victoria (Emily Blunt) is in line for the throne of England. The present King William (Jim Broadbent) is not well and may not live long. However Vicky's scheming mother The Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richandson) and her aide John (Mark Strong) want to force Victoria to sign papers declaring them to be the regents until she is older since she is only 20 years of age. The young lady refuses despite John slapping her around. It is another sign that Victoria has a strong will and deep love for her country. Yet when William does pass away shortly after her 21st birthday Victoria knows she has a heavy duty before her. First she must surround herself with the right advisers to govern wisely. She chooses handsome Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) who although an older man is mentioned as a suitor for Vicky. Which brings us to the young queen's second major decision. Sooner than not the young queen should select her future mate as it will bring stability to her life and to those of the kingdom for an heir must appear in the coming years. Meanwhile in Germany some distant relatives of the British royal family are hatching some plans as well. Handsome Prince Albert (Rupert Friend) of the Saxon-Coburg dynasty is prodded by his father to court the young English royal. Once he arrives at the palace he is smitten and the feeling seems to be mutual. But since he is a minor player on the map of royal match-making can he succeed in winning her heart? This is a lovely film made even better by a completely winning performance by Emily Blunt as Victoria. Yes she is beautiful but it is her intelligent reading of the role that scores mightily. Friend too does well as do the other actors including Broadbent Richardson Bettany Strong (what a repulsive role!) and the rest. Also the movie is gorgeously shot costumed and set making it a visual treat in every way. If anything is lacking it is an extra dose of dazzle as the film seems a bit too straightforward and prosaic at times with a somewhat unimaginative edit. However this is only a minor minor point of argument in an overall very successful and gorgeous film. In short young and old should make time for Young Victoria. It is a most worthy film among 2009 cinematic offerings. 
 Sandra the Making of a Woman is a standout among exploitation films and is so for two reasons: (1) an excellent yet effortless performance by Monica Gayle and (2) the fact that Gary Graver was at the helm of the project. These two talents both of whom are quite underrated make Sandra a film that should be seen. Another key element of the film's success is its realism -- there is nothing fake or Hollywood about this set-in-California film. It is truly a slice of life. The modest house in which Sandra lives at the beginning of the film the simple dresses worn by the character the scene where Sandra wakes up in the morning to find Uschi Digart bouncing at her front door and Sandra sits on the couch without make-up while Digart tries to sell her some cosmetics looking truly as if she just woke up (but nevertheless beautiful) the harmless weirdo Sandra picks up who likes to make love with her while he wears a bra the one-room apartment into which Sandra moves --all of these elements of the film seem totally real and as such the viewer is drawn into Sandra's little world from the beginning and immediately becomes interested in her and wants her to succeed. Sandra also makes her case for free love with eloquence and dignity and she comes off with a lot of class. This film could have easily failed in less competent hands and could have gone off in any of the usual sexploitation directions but the Garver/Gale team see to it that Sandra is not only the making of a woman but the making of an excellent film. 
 I was probably one of the few Australians not watching the tennis when this series aired. I have to say when William McInnes first appeared I though that is one crappy actor! But as the series continued he toned down his performance and I totally loved him. He was such a rotten guy but he did make me laugh. I watched the show to see Hugo Speers (Heart and Bones The Full Monty) and Tom Long (SeaChange Two Hands). It was interesting to see Speers play a nice quiet man and even more interesting to watch Tom Longs' rippling muscles! Sigh... Seriously Long's performance was a total shock and really brilliant. He stole the show. Martin Sacks was good also in a small role and the leading actress put in an entertaining performance. I'd recommend this programme if you enjoy stories with a twist and watching Tom Long walk around with no shirt on... 
 Astronaut Steve West (Alex Rebar) and his comrades undertake a space mission that sees them flying through the rings of Saturn. His comrades are killed instantly but it would seem that they are in fact the lucky ones. Steve returns to Earth a constantly oozing mass of humanoid pulp; as he turns into a savage killer melting every step of the way he is tracked by his friend Dr. Ted Nelson (Burr DeBenning). This is often so uproariously funny - with enough absurd lines and situations to go around - that it's hard for me to believe that the laughs are all unintentional. It seems to me to be kind of a goof on low-budget genre efforts from the '50's and 60's and as such it's a marvelously entertaining movie. That sequence with the nurse is simply hilarious. We're even treated to a split screen sequence that doesn't really add anything but is still a gas to watch. Writer / director William Sachs deserves credit for coming up with this ingenious idea; his ultra-slimy character is a memorable one indeed. I think his pacing is a little off; some scenes (like the one with the elderly couple) go on a little long but ultimately he delivers solid schlocky B-movie goods with a degree of panache. The climax is especially fun. Arlon Obers' music is enjoyably shuddery (yet also amusingly silly during some moments) and Willy Curtis's cinematography creates some really great shots at times. That brings me to Rick Bakers' fantastic and convincing makeup effects which form a highly respectable centerpiece for the movie right down to the ultimate final melt. Rebar is under the heavy makeup for almost the entire movie (Sachs also gets my praise for having the movie hit the ground running) and does what he has to do well enough. DeBenning makes for a rather oafish and silly hero and Ann Sweeney isn't so hot either as his wife but Myron Healey Michael Alldredge and Lisle Wilson are fine in support. It's also worth it to see folk like Cheryl Rainbeaux Smith (doing an appreciable topless shot) Janus Blythe (of Tobe Hoopers' Eaten Alive and Wes Cravens' The Hills Have Eyes ) and even director Jonathan Demme in a bit part. This is a highly entertaining midnight movie with enough gore chills and laughs to rate it as worth catching for lovers of low-grade sci-fi / horror everywhere. 8/10 
 Viewing DE VIERDE MAN (aka THE FOURTH MAN) is a slightly unsettling and rather fascinating experience. It's a very tight and intense psychological mystery/thriller from Netherlands's Paul Verhoeven. He directed this film just before he got big with his free-ticket to Hollywood -movie FLESH + BLOOD. In a lot of user-comments on this site I noticed the mentioning of Alfred Hitchcock. Indeed this movie might very well be Hitchcockian but I also noticed touches of early Cronenberg (the visceral) flavors of David Lynch (surreal story-linked visuals) and even Roman Polanski (plot-wise set-up). Funny thing is that the movies by those directors I was thinking of while watching DE VIERDE MAN weren't made until after 1983 the year of release of THE FOURTH MAN. So go figure. Very much credit indeed must be given to the story of the original novel by Gerard Reve this movie is based on. Gerard Reve is also the fictional name of the main character (a tormented writer played by Jeroen Krabb¨¦ balancing on the dangerous line of a severe psychosis). Now has anybody stopped and thought about the fact that the word r¨ºve is French for dream ? And the film does feature a lot of dream-like/nightmarish sequences often to that extend that you don't always know for sure if Gerard is awake or dreaming himself. Could this be coincidence...? Maybe it's just me but I don't think so. Ren¨¦e Soutendijk is pretty amazing as the leading lady (in a rather demanding role). She sometimes seems to be guilty of over-acting (in a subtle way). But that aspect was clearly intentional to portray the character she plays since as this movie progresses you become unsure about what to actually think of this lady and her intentions. Proves again what an excellent actress she is. I might add that the movie contains also several scenes portraying full frontal male & female nudity as well as some rather explicit sex-scenes (and you will even notice that some scenes and aspects clearly were the blueprints of scenes later to be shot for Verhoeven's BASIC INSTINCT). Another aspect this movie has is a lot of symbolism and biblical references/images which supposedly made the film thoroughly hated by some conservative/catholic movements at the time of its European release. Either way it makes the movie worthy of a second viewing. Now someone recently told me he had grave misgivings about DE VIERDE MAN. One of them being that the film supposedly manoeuvers itself into a position where it needs the divine intervention of the Virgin Mary to resolve itself. I myself have big issues with the way Catholicism has been and still is sometimes portrayed in many movies in any genre (so not only when it comes to religiously themed horror movies). But surprisingly I had no misgivings whatsoever when it comes to THE FOURTH MAN. Although the Virgin Mary-aspect in the plot did make me scratch my head at one point I also had fun with it in a way. I think the keyword as to why it didn't bother me at all is 'duality'. Because this movie works on two levels. Although 'divine intervention' might have resolved the plot-line from the protagonist's point of view... on the other hand: the movie implies that all this might have been the delirious ramblings of a raving madman. And that's the fun part: You never know for sure. And then there's the question: Could it be that Gerard Reve was somehow receiving distorted visions of things to come... like receiving omens? At one point in the movie Gerard even tries to fool Christine into believing he is clairvoyant. The way he is playing Christine in that particular scene is exquisite to behold. So with its compelling story convincing acting performances and adequate direction DE VIERDE MAN is a very much recommended viewing indeed (especially if you enjoy a solid European psychological horror film). But make sure you see the original Dutch version (not the dubbed one). 
 First off this is not supposed to be a brilliant and thought provoking film like so many other reviewers seem to compare it to. the first review says something along the lines of anyone who likes this knows nothing about horror cinema apparently its the other way around. If one were to look back after the film it really wasn't meant to be convincing it was a low budget ipecac. But really thats all it was aiming for it was meant to blow viewers away with sheer shock value (and all the flaws it its visuals were much less noticeable back in the original VHS versions). I gave this one a high score because it reached its goal and even though it was not downright horrific (in non-shock sense) it did make me slightly sick and thoroughly paranoid/pessimistic(i didn't trust anyone for about a week because i didn't want to wake up strung up and tortured) 
 I'll keep this one quite short. I believe that this is an extraordinary movie. I see other reviewers who have commented to the effect that it's badly written poorly shot has a terrible soundtrack and worse that it's not real in its portrayal of life. OK so it may not be quite believable for its whole length but this movie carries a message of hope which some others seemed to have missed. Hope that it isn't too late to save people from the terrible things that go on in so many lives. Gangland violence is real right? Is it right no! This movie carries an important social message which the cynics may dislike but which nonetheless is to be praised rather than denigrated. I have watched this movie with great enjoyment at least eight times each time with equal enjoyment and each time with the feeling that maybe the world could be made better and is not beyond saving (well not until 2008 anyway). 9 out of 10 from me for this one. It's very nearly perfect in my view. JMV 
 I have no idea why this flick is getting such a bad rap by so many IMDb users (Some are saying it's his 'worst movie ever.' What?? Haven't any of you seen Cradle 2 The Grave?) My favorite criticism is that the plot is totally stupid and just an excuse to hang all of the action sequences on. Duh! What the crap were you expecting from a Jet Li movie? Did you honestly believe that someone thought up the story then just loaded it up with action? Of course not! Black Mask is awesome wall-to-wall action throughout nearly it's entire running time. It's also deliciously gruesome and we get plenty of severed limbs decapitations and creative ways of watching the bad guys (and quite a few innocent people too!) get slaughtered. Most of Li's other martial arts films are nursery-school when compared to Black Mask; there is no holding back on the gratuitous violence bloodshed or action sequences whatsoever! And that made me a happy camper. Again: if you go into a Jet Li movie expecting magnificent dialog and an intriguing plot you are going for the wrong reasons. Black Mask is probably my favorite of his movies (though beware of the horrendous dubbing). 
 There are some films that every Horror fan owes himself (or herself) to see and Emilio Miraglia's La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte aka. The Red Queen Kills Seven Times (1972) is definitely one of them. With Gialli and Gothic Tales being my two favorite sub-genres in Horror I was looking forward to seeing this film for quite a while and even though my expectations were high this masterpiece surpassed my greatest hopes. Miraglia's earlier Giallo The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave (1971) was already a creepy and highly atmospheric film which successfully mixed Giallo with Gothic Horror but it couldn't possibly compare to this instant personal favorite. The Red Queen Kills Seven Times is hands down one of the most unique and overwhelming Italian Horror films ever made and no lover of the genre could possibly consider missing it. An incredibly mesmerizing Giallo with strong Gothic elements The Red Queen delivers everything one could hope for in either sub-genre: An inventive and incredibly compelling plot spine-chilling suspense a sublimely uncanny setting and a genuinely creepy atmosphere eerily lush colors stylish murders a brilliant score and not least a ravishing female cast lead by the stunningly beautiful Barbara Bouchet - this film simply is one of the most outstanding combinations of elegant beauty and pure terror. The film starts out incredibly in a beautiful Gothic castle in Germany. As little girls Kitty Wildenbr¨¹ck and her sister Evelyn have been fighting when their grandfather tells them the story behind an incredibly uncanny painting: Legend has it that a fiendish Red Lady is to return to the castle every hundred years and kill seven people. Fourteen years later Kitty (Barbara Bouchet) has become a successful fashion photographer. Suddenly people begin to get murdered... Director Miraglia had already proved his incredible talent for style atmosphere and colorful creepiness with The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave and he makes use of these elements even far more effectively in this gem. The Red Queen Kills Seven Times is a feast for the eyes indeed and one of the most overwhelming Italian Horror films both visually and plot-wise. The haunting painting in the Grandfather's castle alone is capable of giving the viewer the goosebumps. The Red Lady (or Red Queen as she is called in the English title) is arguably the most fiendish figure ever in a Giallo the spine-chilling laughter that the murders are accompanied by would even be frightening on its own. A sexy female cast is always appreciated especially in a Giallo and this one is a prime example for that. The ravishing Barbara Bouchet (one of my favorite actresses) must be one of the most stunningly beautiful ladies ever to appear on screen and she is a great actress too. Bouchet's presence has graded up many Italian flicks among other appearances she starred in three of the greatest Cult-masterpieces of Italian 70s cinema within one year (1972): Fernando Di Leo's Milano Calibro 9 Lucio Fulci's Giallo-highlight Don't Torture a Duckling and this unforgettable gem. Apart from the wonderful Miss Bouchet the film's gorgeous female cast includes sexy young Sybil Danning Marina Malfatti ( The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave ) and other beauties who are not afraid to bare it for the camera. As the whole film the murders are stylish and extremely elegant yet frightening and macabre and some of them are quite gory. Bruno Nicolai's mesmerizing score is as memorable as it gets and makes the film's intensely eerie atmosphere even more haunting. The plot is ingeniously convoluted and full of red herrings the tension-level increses with each passing minute. The Red Queen... begins creepy and it stays stunning to the last second. Overall this is one of the films that I cannot find enough words of praise for. The Red Queen Kills Seven Times is an absolute masterpiece that easily ranks among the finest Gialli ever made and a top-priority for every fan of Horror and/or Italian cinema to see. 10/10 
 People tend to complain about the number of films being made about mentally disabled people. I don't see this as a valid criticism no more than complaints of too many films about any sort of people. Jaco van Dormael does a wonderful job with the script and direction. Daniel Auteuil and Pascal Duquenne work perfectly together with Duquenne basically playing himself. The film covers a surprisingly large ground of events and isn't simply content to go over what was seen in Rain Man . The ending is rather depressing but it doesn't ruin the wonderful story that has come before. 7.8 out of 10 
 As Peckinpah did with STRAW DOGS and Kubrick with A CLOCKWORK ORANGE director John Boorman delivers an effective film about Man's violent side in DELIVERANCE arguably a definitive horror film of the 1970s. Burt Reynolds Jon Voight Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox portray four Atlanta businessmen who decide to take a canoe trip down the wild Cahulawassee River in northern Georgia before it is dammed up into what Reynolds calls one big dead lake. But the local mountain folk take a painfully obvious dim view of these city boys carousing through their woods. And the following day continuing on down the river Beatty and Voight are accosted and sexually assaulted (the film's infamous SQUEAL! sequence) by two vicious mountain men (Bill McKinney Herbert Cowboy Coward). Thus what started out as nothing more than a lark through the Appalachians has now turned into a nightmare in which our four protagonists come to see the thin line that exists between what we think of as civilization and what we think of as barbarism. James Dickey adapted the screenplay from his own best-selling book and the result is an often gripping and disturbing shocker. Often known for its SQUEAL! and Dueling Banjos sequences DELIVERANCE is also quite a pulse-pounding ordeal with the four leading men superb in their roles and McKinney and Coward making for two of the most frightening villains of all times. A must-see film for those willing to take a chance. 
 Darius Goes West is a film depicting American belief that everything is possible if you try hard enough. This wonderful fun filled and sometimes heartbreaking film shows a young man who never expected but longed to see what was outside the confines of his lovely city of Athens GA. Darius wished to see the ocean. His longtime friends Logan Ben and several other good friends decided to make Darius' wish come true. They started small - Ben & Logan's mom started an email campaign to bring awareness to Darius' condition: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and to raise funds for the fellas to take Darius to not only see the ocean but to see these great United States. To say the young college buddies succeeded in bringing hope and awareness to this dreaded disease would be an understatement. They realized Darius' dream and then some. They put their lives on hold while showing love care and tons of fun to Darius while helping Darius see how he can in turn show those same traits to others suffering from DMD. Darius went on to volunteer for the Red Cross - sitting in his chair collecting money (along with his buddies) outside a local grocery store. His wonderful smile tells the world that dreams do come true - all you need is hope and a group of college friends to support and care for you. Give Darius and all the guys an Oscar - no one else deserves it more. Martha Sweeney. 
 Pinjar by Mr dwivedi is an awesome movie. Its definitely the greaest and finest of 2003. There are very good performances in it. Dwivedi knows what he can extract from MAST Urmila. she is like u have never seen before. one true great performance. along with her is a fine actor Manoj bajpai who has shown bollywood what he is with Bhiku Mhatre. The movie is about a girl(Urmila) living in Pre-partition pakistan. she is from a punjabi family livin in a small town. she is been kidnapped by a muslim guy as a part of a going-on-for-years kinda fight with the punjabi family. and then follows a series of twists and turns as urmila's arranged marriage is due in few days. this movie is truly a very good movie. the storyline is solid with an amazing screenplay. all the performances like lillete dubey isha koppikar (u wont believ but she can act as well besides jus dancin on Khallas) kulbhushan kharbanda and many more. those sets with pre-partition pakistan costumes cinematography sound background score add to the positive points. from the start till the end u r stuck to u'r seat with the question whats next? this movie is not jus worth watchin but deserved to be a part of your movie collection. the ultimate scene is the end of the movie. i would suggest all those No-Kabhi-Khushi-Kabhi-gum-and-No-Dil-To-Pagal-Hai crowd to watch this amazing flick. my rating: 10/10. 
 I've been waiting for a superhero movie like this for a long time. Mystery Men takes its place among the classic comic-strip spoofs on TV like Batman and Captain Nice and cartoons like Underdog and Super Chicken. The same spirit lives in all of them: the comic tongue-in-cheek tone; the courage to aim for the heroic in life at the risk of looking ridiculous; the not-so-sure-footed way that these characters manage to prevail over their adversaries. It's the misfired spark of nobility igniting in the weak and the ordinary and it's wonderful to see it glow so high and bright here. Mystery Men opens on a party at a nursing home. I wish Kinka Usher had had the sense to give more energy and life to the old people in the scene. As it is it looks like something George Romero might have devised. We need to get the feeling that these old people are as sharp as everyone else or it feels patronizing. By the time the Red Eyes crash the festivities you half expect Tom Waits who plays a weapons inventor with a penchant for ladies in their eighties to stand up and shout: Just what this party needs--a little excitement! If writer Neil Cuthbert had any sense he would have had Waits mixing it up with the intruders and egging on the partiers to do the same. It would have made for a rousing beginning and a better introduction of the troublesome trio: the Shoveler (William Macy); the Blue Raja (Hank Azaria); and Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller) who seem to come out of nowhere to save the day. There are many other problems to Mystery Men than I care to go into; among them that the villain Casanova Frankenstein needs to have as cultivated a sense of the absurd as the rest of the people in this movie and he doesn't. Geoffrey Rush is the wrong actor for the part; he needs to be way over the top to make the conflict between good and evil a galvanic one. And Rush has never exhibited a talent for the outre. You hope for the ripe theatrics of a John Lithgow in The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai or the dry debonair diffidence of a Paul Freeman in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Instead what we get is pastiche; something half-baked and not fully realized. There are too many ideas running through Mystery Men for anyone to tie them neatly together and that may be its deepest problem. But whatever kind of a mess it is is the kind of mess I love. Ben Stiller has always seemed to be slumming in the roles he takes. This one is no exception but he goes at it with such conviction that you come away feeling that he'd learned something about comedy growing up in a household run by Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara. His Roy is related to all the put-upon overly sensitive chronically defensive types that Woody Allen made popular. And whether it's wheedling his way into the affections of the waitress at his favorite hangout (the sleek Claire Forslani) or questioning the wisdom of a fellow superhero (Wes Studi as the Sphinx) or giving a new member of their elite group (Jeaneane Garofalo in what are possibly her funniest moments on screen) a hard time he makes it always fun to watch. I couldn't exactly say that about him in There's Something About Mary. Jeaneane Garofalo proves with this performance that she should have been the star of One True Thing not Renee Zellweger. I don't think I have ever seen funnier exchanges between a daughter and father (okay so he's dead and his skull is in a bowling ball so sue me) in the movies. And the funny part about this role is that it feels like a screwball reprise of Emily Watson's spellbinding talks with God in Breaking the Waves. And in this version the girl doesn't die and bells don't ring in your head. William H. Macy does something very difficult; he makes stolid magnetic. You understand right away what's attracted Jenifer Lewis' Lucille to Eddie. You can also understand her exasperation. The barbecue alone would be enough to drive me over the edge but when Eddie's adorable half-breed son looks up at his father and says I believe in you Daddy. to which Lucille sighs and exclaims Roland don't encourage your father you feel like standing and hailing Neil Cuthbert as a first-rate wit. With Hank Azaria (whose only moment of note in film up to this point was his bare behind in The Birdcage ) and Louise Lasser (Has it been more than two decades since we first took note of her in Bananas and Mary Hartman Mary Hartman? ) as son and mother who share a fondness for silverware; Greg Kinnear as Captain Amazing and Ricky Jay as his publicist; Kel Mitchell as Invisible Boy ; Paul Reubens as The Spleen; and Lena Olin who if she didn't have the few lines in this movie that she has would seem to be visiting the set. 
 Mr. Harvey Lights a Candle is anchored by a brilliant performance by Timothy Spall. While we can predict that his titular morose up tight teacher will have some sort of break down or catharsis based on some deep down secret from his past how his emotions are unveiled is surprising. Spall's range of feelings conveyed is quite moving and more than he usually gets to portray as part of the Mike Leigh repertory. While an expected boring school bus trip has only been used for comic purposes such as on The Simpsons this central situation of a visit to Salisbury Cathedral in Rhidian Brook's script is well-contained and structured for dramatic purposes and is almost formally divided into acts. We're introduced to the urban British range of racially and religiously diverse kids (with their uniforms I couldn't tell if this is a private or public school) as they gather ? the rapping black kids the serious South Asians and Muslims the white bullies and mean girls ? but conveyed quite naturally and individually. The young actors some of whom I recognized from British TV such as Shameless were exuberant in representing the usual range of junior high social pressures. Celia Imrie puts more warmth into the supervisor's role than the martinets she usually has to play. A break in the trip leads to a transformative crisis for some while others remain amusingly oblivious. We think like the teacher portrayed by Ben Miles of Coupling that we will be spoon fed a didactic lesson about religious tolerance but it's much more about faith in people as well as God which is why the BBC showed it in England at Easter time and BBC America showed it in the U.S. over Christmas. Nathalie Press who was also so good in Summer of Love has a key role in Mr. Harvey's redemption that could have been played for movie-of-the-week preaching but is touching as they reach out to each other in an unexpected way (unfortunately I saw their intense scene interrupted by commercials). While it is a bit heavy-handed in several times pointedly calling this road trip a pilgrimage this quiet film was the best evocation of good will towards men than I've seen in most holiday-themed TV movies. 
 this is my first review on IMDb i didn't really want to write one but since there are only 2 for this great movie right now i feel compelled to add my perspective...and no i'm not associated to the movie makers in any way (yeah yeah how often did you here that before ;-) ) FYI i'm in my late 20s 1st of all i have to admit i really like animated movies because what you see is only limited by the imagination of the creators and they were pretty imaginative on this one. Not so much in terms of story but in achieving a very unique and imo fresh visual style. The characters look good but far from real and it works well for the movie after all it's a fairytale-like world. But the backgrounds and the world in general is filled with awesome visuals that my jaw dropped several times while watching this. The blue bunny-like mini-dragon steels the show and has easily some of the funniest moments of the movie he is already an instant classic much as Scrat from Ice Age. The story is not too surprising (a bunch of anti-heroes have to go out and slay the biggest dragon you can imagine) but who cares if the movie looks and sounds THAT good ;-) 1 thing i have to point out imo the movie is not suited for VERY young children because it has some darker scenes in it and maybe frightening for kids under 6-8 i would say these are only very few scenes but worth mentioning imo. Anyway i had a great time watching this and can't wait for it to hit the stores in high def to watch it over and over again just for the sheer beauty of it. 8 5 for me 
 I got to say that Uma Thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet. this movie was uber cute and I mean uber cute. It had all the sex content that most Ivan Reitman comedies have but with something a lil extra CHEMISTRY. Uma and Luke both have this awkrawrd but believable chemistry that seem to transcend in each scene . Both seem to create this odd twisted and interesting relationship with powerful sexual tension that you laugh until you can't feel your face anymore. Anna Farris and the rest of the supporting cast seem to play off each other's roles perfectly and even Wanda Sykes' rather small role will keep you laughing. Though these kind of comedies aren't for everybody but I have to say I went with a person that doesn't usually enjoy these films and he was laughing like crazy. This movie is certainly not for everyone. especially younger children since some moments are little too...well lets say ADULT for younger viewers. All in all I was pleasantly surprised by this movie tough the ending I found was a little weak compared to the rest of the film. (3 1/2* out of 5*) 
 I thought this was a very good movie. It would have been nice to have seen a little more into the movie about the 2 sisters knowing about each liking the same boy before he was killed off. I'm sure if the movie had been done this way there would have been a very different ending that's why this made this move such a good movie. It shows that no matter what happens in your life with your siblings that you can always get thru it and that if it's 2 sisters dealing with a boy (the same boy) that working thru the pain and hurt makes things to seem better and easier to work out between the 2 of them. It's nice to see love stories that have a terrible thing to happen in someone's life that you can still get thru it become even closer after its over. I really enjoyed watching this movie and I still do now when it comes on. I seem to find myself watching it every time it comes on. It would have been nice if there would have been a part 2 for this movie maybe having the older sister to come up and have his baby this would really have made a great finish to the story since he died this way it would keep him alive even though he's dead. 
 Two women sick of their controlling husbands taking a vacation in Italy for a month with two other very different women.They come back refreshed and energized in this wonderful little film by Merchant - Ivory. Great scenery and the location isn't bad either. Seriously a very good period piece 7 of 10 
 I remembered this as being one of my favorite books as a child and had been wanting to read it to my 5 year old daughter for a while now. I knew the movie was coming out soon so we went to the library to get the book and they gave us preview passes for the next day! We rushed home and spent the afternoon reading the book so we could compare. Wasn't necessary. The only thing in common between the book and the movie is the main characters' first name the fact that there is a bet and a whole lot of worm eating. Oh yeah I almost forgot the kid who cooks most of the worms likes to present his masterpieces with a french accent. How the kids know each other the number of kids involved how the bet came about the number of worms that must be eaten the time frame in which he has to eat the worms how they are cooked progression of friendships climax scenes etc. NOTHING is the same. But somehow it did not ruin the movie for me. The characters are all enjoyable and the film did not leave me disappointed. Word of caution for parents there was one moment when you could hear the adults in the room collectively draw their breath and that was when Billy's little brother referred to his penis as a dilly dick . The embarrassing part came when my daughter proceeded to ask those sitting around us Does anybody know what a dilly dick is? lol. That and an occasional shut up is as foul mouthed as this film gets. My daughter thought she might get sick around worm 3 and 4 (and was holding the empty nacho container just in case) but was fine by worm 6. She and I both really enjoyed the film and had a wonderful time sharing the experience. 
 This is one of the creepiest scariest and most heartbreaking horror movie EVER! Dr Creed (Louise) and his family moving in to new home with his wife (Rachel) Daughter (Ellie) and little son (Gage) Everything seems normal until Dr Creed loses one his patient who had a terrible head injury Then he is haunted by the ghost know as Victor takes him to the Pet Sematarty and show him that where the dead come to life. Louis not knowing if that was all dream and is talking to Ellie who worried about her cat that could be killed by lorry and then later on Rachel tells Louis that it really hard for to talk about death because of her sister Zelda who was really sick (As we see in a flashback how sick her sister really was and this is one of the most creepiest scene ever!) The next day Louis gets a call from Jed saying there cat as been killed by lorry and Jed take him to place where Victor the Ghost told him not to go! And bury the Cat His wife and kids have go to see their Grandparents and Louise is home alone shocked to see the cat is back and now it as evil in it eyes so he goes to see Jed then Jed tell him that he also buried his dog there too (As we seen other flashback). Later on in the movie The Family out having Picnic Gage is playing with kite and Gage say's I drop it The wind blow the rod near the road where a lorry coming at fast past Gage is get closer to road Louis is rushing to get him The most HEARTBREAKING scene in any horror movie will leave with your Jaw on floor or Shivers will go down your back when you hear Louis screams Soon he missing him so much Louis then buries Gage in same place where is buried the Cat. The scariest thing about this movie is that some scenes in this movie are not too far from really life. This movie is just Amazing and the acting from everyone was great! 10 out 10 
 I found about the movie Holes by hearing from people that it wasn't typical Disney that both kids and adults both got into the story. Folks let me tell you I wasn't disappointed. Holes is based on the novel by Louis Sachar and follows the adventure of Stanley Yelnats a boy who gets sent to a strange juvenile detention camp out in the desert. He befriends a boy nicknamed Zero and together they set out on adventure that changes their lives. It was a very interesting unique different and funny story. I didn't know quite what to expect when I watched it. It was interesting to see the story come together like pieces of a puzzle. The boys who played the juvenile delinquents were all very funny and Jon Voight was just hilarious as Mr. Sir. Now that I've seen the movie I have to read the book. Most recommended! 
 This is a great movie that I don't think gets enough credit as Saturday Night Fever or Grease in John Travolta's career. He plays a man who is in love with a girl but is too pig headed to admit his feelings to her. Instead he wants to engage in mechanical bull riding because he thinks it will show his manhood. Even though it was made in 1980 it is still timely today. The great country music soundtrack is terrific. 10/10 
 The first time I saw this film I was in shock for days afterwards. Its painstaking and absorbing treatment of the subject holds the attention helped by good acting and some really intriguing music. The ending quite simply had me gasping. First rate! 
 Now days most people don't watch classic movies such as this. Most of friends only watch movies from the '90s to present. Thats kinda stingy. Most old movies like this are masterpieces unique in their own way. Only because back when these movies were being thought of and made thats when ideas were fresh. Now people strain just to think of new ideas. Anyway to the movie. For true fans of classic horror. This is for you. The movie is based with a investigator from Scotland Yard investigating the disappearance of an movie actor and stumbles on to three other strange occurrences with past residents of the same house. I won't say anymore for I will ruin the movie more than I already have. But it is a terrific movie for as old as it is. And would never mind watching it again! 
 Holly addresses the issue of child sexploitation that is rampant all over the world (some 2 million children are trafficked every year) and does so sensitively and without manipulation--a tall order that the team at Priority Films does with great success. American actor Ron Livington stars in the film alongside newcomer Thuy Nguyen a Vietnamese actress who plays Holly and together they bring to screen what is commonplace to the people at the notorious k11 redlight district in Cambodia. Although it tackles a heavy topic the film holds on to moments of laughter and hope as we get to know the characters up close keeping the two-hour film from being one that is too difficult to watch. I am glad a film like this is bringing the world's attention to the problem. Child prostitution needs to be stopped and this is a very good first step. It's GREAT and a film EVERYONE must see. 
 In reflecting on this movie I can think of two others to help put it in perspective. One relatively forgettable but covering the same geography is Coup de Torchon the other thousands of miles away and much larger in scope is the unforgettable Indochine. Claire Denis has produced a movie that has some of the grand underpinnings of Indochine the complex and unspoken relationship between France and her colonial subjects. I was struck with the dignity of Potee with his struggle to maintain his dignity among his peers and with his white bosses. I was also struck with the love/hate relationship between him and Aimee. It is the latter that gives the film its driving force it is the latter that links this movie to Indochine. One never is sure what motivates everyone though some of the characters are required of a remembrance of colonialism. It is this cynical side of the story that ties it to Coup de Torchon. Theirs is the more scandalous story perhaps even more interesting in a depraved way but Denis gives us a remembrance of how it was with all the tension and unresolved relationships. The American black who gives the grown up France a ride in the beginning and end of the movie offers yet another interesting side to the confusion that we in the Western world have when we look at Africa. He says that when he came he wanted to call everyone brother. He was coming home but they just thought him to be a little daft. France the character and the girl grew up in Cameroon but neither fully understands what it is even though they can remember how it was. 
 I just recently watched this 1954 movie starring Vincent Price for the first time on Turner Classic Movies. Price portrays Don Gallico a magician/inventor who is driven to murder when his boss steals several of his magical inventions (and also his wife portrayed in a brief role by the lovely Eva Gabor). Even though Price is a murderer I actually found myself rooting for him he is a sympathetic character who is driven mad by the greedy people around him who keep taking advantage of him. Although this movie doesn't have the horror factor of some of his more famous roles (such as my favorite House of Wax ) it nonetheless has enough going for it to keep the viewers interest. This is a must for Vincent Price fans. 
 Never heard of this movie saw it on DVD.Great movie perfect example of a movie that took every cast member to make it work.No overhyped typical Hollywood movie with the same old overhyped actors.No current Quote A list actor could have pulled off any performance in this movie.Brought back memories of my own post Vietnam war military experiences.It concentrated on the people who were sent to fight.As was portrayed by the characters who had fears and emotions even if some volunteered for service.They were regular people too some just weren't cut out for military life I remember a few in my experience--to put it mildly couldn't adapt to military life either-but I'll never forget them-should have stayed in touch.I highly recommend it and then think about those serving present day in Afganistan.Basic training is a trip notice those drill sergeants aren't morning people and maybe they need sensitivity training HA!HA!HA! 
 An interesting TV movie based on true fact betrayed by the description of one of the leading characters that of a prisoner. Giovanni Ribisi plays his younger brother who has the delicate mission of deciding if he will appeal to the courts for his brother's death penalty. But when he goes to visit him and enters Elias Koteas the problem starts. It has nothing to do with Koteas' acting ability. He just looks like the version of a prisoner of proletarian roots according to G.Q. magazine with a language too sophisticated for someone who has spent most of his life behind bars. This realization came to me after meeting again an old friend whom I had not seen for almost 15 years which he spent in several Panamanian jails. The young man I used to know is gone not only because he is older but due to his exposure for a prolonged time to the penal system. There are jails and there are jails one must say but this one prisoner in Shot In the Heart is definitely out of this world. 
 This movie was featured on a very early episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 but when I see this film I don't think about that wonderful TV series. I believe this was a surprisingly good early 40's horror flick with very surprisingly good sound and picture for a 67 year old public domain horror movie. I actually enjoyed watching Bela Lugosi and his bizarre staff including his wife who requires fluid from the glands of young would-be brides an old hag and her two bizarre sons one a giant idiot the other a comical dwarf(Angelo Rossitto from 1932's Freaks). I also enjoyed the plucky young female reporter who is kind of a stereotype but still fun to watch. My only problem with this otherwise decent film is it's plot even ridiculous and unbelievable for a movie. I don't want to spoil any of this film so go out and rent it or better yet buy it for a couple of bucks. 
 Red Rock West is one of those tight noir thrillers we rarely see anymore. It's well paced well acted and doesn't leave us with loose ends or unanswered questions so typical in this genre. Nicolas Cage stars as Michael an unemployed Texas roughneck desperate enough for a job to drive all the way to Wyoming for potential employment. He is honest to a fault but always on the dark side of fate. After failing to obtain gainful employment Michael stumbles into the Red Rock bar where the owner Wayne (J.T.Walsh) mistakes him for a contract killer he summoned from Dallas hired to do in his lovely but lethal wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). Wayne gives Michael the necessary details and a down payment for the hit on the adulterous Suzie. With no intent on following through Michael accepts the money and then sets out to warn Suzanne of her impending demise. He also mails a letter to the local sheriff exposing the plot and splits. As fate would dictate Michael is not going to be rid of the situation that easy. While leaving in a violent rainstorm he runs down Suzannes lover. Of course Michael being Michael he takes him to the local hospital where it's discovered that he's also been shot. The sheriff is summoned and as luck would have it Wayne is also the local law. Michael manages to escape while being taken on that last ride and is subsequently picked up by the real Lyle from Dallas played with murderous glee by the quirky Dennis Hopper. After discovering that they're fellow marines Lyle insists that Michael join him for a drink at where else the Red Rock bar. There Wayne realizes his mistake and soon he and Lyle are in hot pursuit of Michael who falls willingly into Suzannes waiting arms. As the pace picks up we learn that Wayne and Suzanne are really wanted armed robbers on the lam for a multi million dollar theft. Getting the money now becomes the films central focus with a series of betrayals double crosses and murders. The film was very well cast. Nicolas Cage was typically low key Dennis Hopper and Lara Flynn Bolye assumed their respective roles with more than ample ability. The best performance was by the late J.T. Walsh who was menacing without appearing to be. Walsh was a great character actor who left us much too soon. Marc Reshoskys photography utilized many unique angles which added to the suspense and plot development. The film was further enhanced by John Dahl's tight directorial style and Morris Chestnut's rapid fire editing. 
 A weird witty and wonderful depiction of family life! Writer Andrew Marshall has written something that is funny foreboding and occasionally frightening! Yes don't be fooled by 2point4 children's cheerful tune and bubbly characters; the show has a dark side and at times can be quite chilling. And that's what's so good about the show it's not just a simplistic sitcom where every character is a 2D comic device (the case with My Family). Instead the characters are fully rounded individuals that show the full roller-coaster of human emotions. The occasionally dark moments such as Bill being supposedly haunted by a curse and Ben waking up in a bizarre village are two examples of the show taking a surreal dark turn that help add a little depth. Of course the show is also incredibly funny and is a guaranteed to make you smile. It's a real shame Eureka Video have stopped releasing this comical gold on DVD. Veoh.com is your last hope to get hold of episodes unavliable in the shops. 
 Very Slight Spoiler This movie (despite being only on TV) is absolutely excellent. I didn`t really pay attention to the differences in looks or accents so I can`t really comment on that. The acting in this was so good I had to pinch myself and say Remember it`s only a movie this DIDN`T REALLY HAPPEN . As I sat and listened to Harris and Quinn talk I knew that it was exactly what John and Paul would be talking about had they actually had this meeting. The offhanded comments and burns from John were right on with his character(especially in the restaurant!) as was his depression while Paul was very easy going and laid back. Both actors did and excellent job and I was thrilled to have seen this movie. It`s a wicked experience for any Beatles fan. And prepare for a few surprises! 
 The first step to getting off of that road that leads to nowhere is recognizing that you're on it in the first place; then it becomes a matter of being assertive and taking positive steps to overcome the negative influences in your life that may have put you on that road to begin with. Which is exactly what a young Latino girl does in `Girlfight ' written and directed by Karyn Kusama. Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) is an eighteen-year-old High School senior from the projects in Brooklyn facing expulsion after her fourth fight in the halls since the beginning of the semester. She affects a `whatever' attitude which masks a deep-seated anger that threatens to take her into places she'd rather not go. She lives with her father Sandro (Paul Calderon) with whom she has a very tentative relationship and her younger brother Tiny (Ray Santiago). With her life teetering on the brink of dissolution she desperately needs an outlet through which to channel the demons that plague her. And one day she finds it without even looking for it when she stops by the gym where Tiny trains. Ironically Tiny wants nothing to do with boxing; he wants to go to art school but Sandro is determined that his son should be able to take care of himself on the streets and pays the ten dollars a week it costs for his lessons. When Diana convinces Tiny's trainer Hector (Jaime Tirelli) to take her on and approaches her father for the money under the guise of calling it a weekly allowance (she doesn't want him to know what she wants the money for) Sandro turns her down and tells her to go out and earn her own money. Ultimately with Tiny's help she finds a way and the ring soon becomes her second home. It's an environment to which she readily adapts and it appears that her life is about to take a turn for the better. And the fact that she will have to fight men not women in `gender blind' competitions does not faze her in the least. Diana has found her element. First time writer/director Karyn Kusama has done a terrific job of creating a realistic setting for her story presenting an honest portrait of life in the projects and conveying that desperation so familiar to so many young people who find themselves in dead-end situations and on that road that leads to nowhere. And there's no candy coating on it either; as Hector tells Diana when she asks him how he came to be where he is `I was a fighter once. I lost.' Then looking around the busy gym `Like most of these guys they're going to lose too. But it's all they know--' And it's that honesty of attitude as well as the way in which the characters are portrayed that makes this movie as good as it is. It's a bleak world underscored by the dimly lit run-down gym-- you can fairly smell the sweat of the boxers-- and that sense of desolation that hangs over it all like a pall blanketing these people who are grasping and hanging on to the one and only thing they have all that they know. Making her screen debut Michelle Rodriguez is perfectly cast as Diana infusing her with a depth and brooding intensity that fairly radiates off of her in waves. She is so real that it makes you wonder how much of it is really Rodriguez; exactly where does the actor leave off and the character begin? Whatever it is it works. It's a powerful memorable performance by an actor from whom we will await another endeavor with great anticipation. She certainly makes Diana a positive role model one in whom many hopefully will find inspiration and the realization that there are alternative paths available in life at least to those who would seek them out. As positive as this film is however it ends on something of an ambiguous note; though Diana obviously has her feet on the ground there's no indication of where she's headed. Is this a short term fix for her or is she destined to become the female counterpart of Hector? After all realistically (and in light of the fact that the realism is one of the strengths of this film) professional boxing isn't exactly a profession that lends itself to nor opens it's arms to women. And in keeping with the subject matter of the film and the approach of the filmmaker an affirmation of the results of Diana's assertiveness would have been appropriate. The supporting cast includes Santiago Douglas (Adrian) Elisa Bocanegra (Marisol) Alicia Ashley (Ricki) and Thomas Barbour (Ira). Though it delivers a very real picture of life to which many will be able to identify there are certain aspects of `Girlfight ' that stretch credibility a bit regarding some of what happens in the ring. That aside it's a positive film that for the most part is a satisfying experience. I rate this one 7/10. 
 This movie is probably for you. It had an overall meditative quality from the music to the beautiful photography and listening to the often clich¨¦ things about life that Andy Goldsworthy would say as he worked or in between shots. If you're familiar with Buddhism- that is the sort of the sense I got out of this film. The impermanence of life the beauty of nature the interconnectedness of all things etc. However what I did not understand confused and ultimately forced me to leave without finishing (I saw over an hour of it) was the redundancy of the whole thing. You only find out bits and pieces of why he's commissioned and how he can even afford to live off of this kind of work. The art work comes alive but all his talking with no conclusions leads to dead ends. 
 Jimmy Cagney races by your eyes constantly in this story of a stage-producer who is vigorously struggling against the upcoming talking movies. This story of love deceit women and dancing is presented in such a manner that as a viewer you are never treated to a dull moment. The direction of the mass scenes in the rehearsal rooms was enormously well done. The story never really got lost in this frantic pace. Some parts of the material presented here have become a little dated but that doesn't matter because when you look at this in a 1933 time-frame it is fabulous to watch this next to a lot of the other drags of movies that were released during that time. Jimmy Cagney is a sight for sore eyes in this film never loosing his composure as the ever-working producer of previews made for the movie theaters as intros. In this way he tries to save his ass from going out of business he was a broadway producer before he started this. Joan Blondell is fabulous as the neglected love-interest Nan she gives such a spirited performance that is so unusual for movies of that time so cool to watch a woman who is portrayed as a strong woman for a change. The only problem I had with the film were the enormous productions at the end. These were magnificent in itself beautifully choreographed and wonderfully produced but they just didn't seem to fit in the story. The only link they have to the main story is that Cagney had to put on 3 previews in 3 days to get a contract and that's what he did. I had a hard time believing that this was what the girls had been rehearsing during the entire movie and that these sets could fit in a movie theater. In this way the Sitting On A Backyard Fence was much more appropriate to the story. The productions at the end seemed to drag this frantically paced story to a halt and that was not a good thing. I was tired after seeing the first Musical sequence and then I realized there were another two coming up. These sequences got a lot a chuckles from the audience as well. All in all a great film with a sour ending. 9/10 
 Do not expect a depiction of the truth . However the accounts of these veterans of the Iraqi & Afghanistan wars demand thoughtful consideration. The major strength of the film is that it vividly portrays the words and war wounds of these vets and their post-war struggles to reconstruct some degree of normalcy and functionality to their lives. My major criticism of the film is twofold: it is one-sided and it advocates anti-war activism but nothing more to correct the serious shortcomings of the military's and Veterans Affairs' programs for helping those who've suffered and still suffer the traumas of war. These are NOT fatal flaws of the film. As a veteran myself I know that the horrible aftermath of war is real and these young men and women articulate it very well. These vets vividly describe the physical and mental pain and torment that most veterans experience and that ordinary people need to understand because the horrors of ALL wars are so traumatic and disturbing. 
 Remarkable disturbing film about the true-life senseless brutal murder of a small-town family along with the aftermath and examination of the lives of the killers Dick Hickok and Perry Smith. No matter how much time goes by or how dated this film may look it still resonates the utter incomprehensibility of criminal acts such as this. This really traces multiple tragedies: The tragedy brutality and senselessness of the murder of the Clutter family a decent farm family in small-town Holcomb Kansas; and the wasted brutal and sad lives of Hickok and Smith. An interesting point is made in the film: that neither of these two immature scared petty criminals would have ever contemplated going through with something like this alone. But together they created a dangerous murderous collective personality; one that fed the needs and pathology of each of them. They push each other along a road of proving something to each other. That they were man enough to do it to carry it out; neither wants to be seen as too cowardly to complete their big score ; an unfortunate and dangerous residue of the desolate lives they led. These were two grown-up children who live in a criminal's world of not backing down from dares; who constantly need to prove manhood and toughness. in this instance these needs carried right through to the murder of the Clutters. The film contains a somewhat sentimentalized look at the Clutter family but the point is made. These were respected law-abiding small-town people who didn't deserve this terrifying fate. The movie also gives us a sense of the young lives of Hickok and Smith. Perry Smith whose early life was filled with security and love but watched in horror as alcohol took his family down a tragic path. Hickok poor and left pretty much to his own devices not able to see how he fit in using his intelligence and charm to con everyone he came into contact with. An interesting and maybe the first look at capital punishment and what ends we hope to achieve. Is this nothing more than revenge killing for a murder that rocked a nation at a time when we had not yet had to fully face that there might be such predators among us or does putting these guys at the end of a rope truly provide a deterent to the childish and brutal posturing of men like these? Is it possible to deter men who live lives of deceit operating under the radar believing they fool everyone they come into contact with? To be deterred you must believe it's possible you will be caught. Is it possible to deter these men who believe they are too clever to be caught?; who have committed hundreds of petty crimes and got away with them? This was supposed to be a cinch no witnesses . When caught Hickok finds he can't charm and con the agents the way he had department store clerks. Smith who believes he deserves such a fate anyway who seemed to be the only one who truly grasped the gravity of what they had done willingly tells the story when he learns that Hickok has cowardly caved in. Hickok blinked first. A silly game of chicken between two immature emotionally damaged dangerous men. Fascinating psychological thriller telling a story of a horrendous crime in this nation's history. Stunning portrayals by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. These roles made their careers. 
 I picked this film up based on the plot summary and critics' quotes on the back of the box. I'm not big into foreign films and didn't know what to expect. I don't really care for subtitles either. But I absolutely loved it! It has a simple lovable quality that leaves you feeling good about life. I found myself laughing out loud repeatedly. I'd recommend this picture to anyone even those who abhor foreign films with subtitles. This one makes it worth the effort. 
 Unfortunately this film has long been unavailable (as other posters have noted) but this is one of the essential dramas of the Great Depression a lyrical and touching drama of love set in a shanty-town. It features performances by Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young that are just about the finest of their careers and it's a surpassing example of how the director Frank Borzage was able to create an almost fairy-tale aura around elements of poverty crime and horrendous social inequity which just proves that how truly romantic and spiritual his talents were. This film shows how love survives amidst squalor and desperate need and it is totally life-affirming. This is a real masterpiece of the period and is a movie that deserves to be more widely known. 
 Night of the Living Homeless was a fairly strong finish to the first half of Season 11. Obviously a parody of various zombie movies most notably Dawn of the Dead this episode parallels the homeless with the living dead as creatures who feed and thrive off of spare change rather than brains. Kyle is blamed for the sudden mass outbreak of homeless people when he out of the goodness of his heart gives a $20 to a homeless man in front of his house. More homeless people begin to infiltrate South Park until the town is completely overrun with them. This is a very strong Randy Marsh episode as he assumes the role of the shotgun-wielding leader of the adults who take refuge on the roof of the Park County Community Center. But before Randy makes it to the community center he is accosted by hundreds of homeless people while hilariously screaming I don't have any change!! Unfortunately the refugees end up losing Gerald Broflofski to the homeless when he tries to escape by catching a bus out of town and unwittingly tosses away all his change for the bus to distract the homeless people. Then he becomes one of them asking everyone for change. The boys attempt to find out why there are so many homeless people in South Park and find a man who is a director of homeless studies. They find out that the nearby city of Evergreen used to have a similar problem with the homeless so they escape to Evergreen to find out what they did to solve the problem. Unfortunately homeless people break into the man's house and he attempts to take the easy way out by shooting himself. However he fails several times as he shoots himself in the jaw in the eye in the chest in the neck in the shoulder screaming horribly until he finally dies. This scene may have been funnier had a similar scene not happened in Fantastic Easter Special two weeks ago. Meanwhile a member of the refugees discovers that due to the homeless problem the property values have nosedived thus the bank has foreclosed on his house making him homeless. Randy immediately turns on him holding the gun to the man's head. When the man finally begs the others for a few bucks to help him out Randy pulls the trigger. In Evergreen the boys find out that the citizens of the town sent the homeless to South Park and that the passing of homeless from town to town happens all over the country. The boys modify a bus that leads the homeless out of South Park and takes them all the way to Santa Monica California. The zombie movie parallels and the great Randy Marsh lines make this one definitely re-watchable. 8/10 
 The lovely Danish actress Sonja Richter steals this film from under the noses of everyone no small feat considering the terrific performances surrounding her. Richter plays Anna an out-of-work independent-minded somewhat neurotic (and perhaps suicidal) actress who lands a desperation job looking after a wheelchair-bound muted aged father named Walentin (the great Danish actor Frits Helmuth who died at 77 shortly after this film was made). SPOILER ALERT Walentin refuses to respond to anyone --until he confronts the gifted Anna whose whimsical and mischievous manner brings the poor old battered devil back from a self-imposed death sentence. Writer/director/actor Eric Clausen has made a strong film about the difficulty a ponderous businessman son (Jorgen played by Clausen) has loving a father who has never accepted him. The film sags toward the end but Clausen has some important things to say about euthanasia the nature and value of loving and caring and how one person the irrepressible Anna can alter the course of a human life. Highly recommended. Sonja Richter's performance is alone worth the price of admission. 
 Playing a character from a literary classic can be a bit of a poisoned chalice for an actor paying for the pleasure of a meaty character by competing with the fantasies of generations of readers ? not to mention the numerous other actors who've besieged the castle before. Fortunately for the fantasists this version ? with the nicely cast Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton ? stands head and shoulders above versions that have come after it. It's the right length to do the story full justice and makes considerable use of Bronte's cracking dialogue; none of that modern meddling away cutting text and adding new and inferior scenes. The magic of the original story lies in the tensions created between the central characters and the lives circumstances create for them to lead. Jane ? poor plain and little ? grows up on the stinting charity of a cold aunt her nature and independence shaped by a long spell in a very harsh school. She arrives as a governess in the household of Mr Rochester utterly friendless and alone. She represses herself habitually out of duty and hard experience but her passionate nature soon finds its touch-paper in her stern keenly intelligent enigmatic master to whom she is drawn as he is to her by forces beyond their control. Rochester is the caged tiger busy paving hell with energy ; potentially dangerous to all who come into contact with him ? but pervious through a chink or two . His character is extraordinary: he takes extraordinary liberties with a paid subordinate; but then Jane is no ordinary employee as he sees. But a dark secret and severe trials lie before them both. It's a pleasure to hear Bronte's remarkable dialogue spoken by such accomplished actors ? Dalton in particular seems formed for passion on a Brontean scale. If you've only ever seen him as a not-so-memorable Bond you've missed the thing he's best at. Those who've commented that his Rochester is too handsome miss the point of these dramatisations: his character has simply too much screen time for a really ugly man to retain the viewer's attention. Timothy Dalton is just right not always or consistently handsome but often glancingly strikingly so just as it should be. And Zelah Clarke's Jane is no wallflower; she conveys the emotions of a woman who habitually represses her sense of humour and her passionate nature very successfully allowing her rare outbursts to show to more dramatic effect. Not so long ago the BBC aired an excellent dramatisation of Jean Rhys' enlightened and most unsettling riposte to Bronte Wide Sargasso Sea imagining the back-story of the first Mrs Rochester. Do check it out ? you'll never see the 'hero' of Jane Eyre in quite the same way again. 
 This police procedural is no worse than many others of its era and better than quite a few. Obviously it is following in the steps of Dragnet and Naked City but emerges as an enjoyable programmer. The best thing about it is the unadorned look it provides into a world now long gone...the lower class New York of the late 40's/early 50's. Here it is in all its seedy glory from the old-school tattoo parlors to the cheap hotels to the greasy spoons. These old police films are like travelogues to a bygone era and very bittersweet to anybody who dislikes the sanitized soulless cityscape of today. Also intriguing is the emphasis on the nuts-and-bolts scientific aspect of solving the crime...in this case the murder of a tattooed woman found in an abandoned car. Our main heroes Detectives Tobin and Corrigan do the footwork but without the tedious and painstaking efforts of the lab boys they'd get nowhere. Although the technology is not in the same league the cops here use the dogged persistence of a C.S.I. investigator to track down their man. The way some reviewers have written about this movie you think it would have been directed by Ed Wood and acted by extras from his movies. What bosh! I enjoyed John Miles as the gangly ex-Marine turned cop Tobin...he had a happy-go-lucky easy-going approach to the role that's a welcome change from the usual stone-faced histrionics of most movie cops of the period. Patricia Barry is cute and delightful as his perky girlfriend who helps solve the crime. Walter Kinsella is stuffy and droll as the older detective Corrigan. I rather liked the chemistry of these two and it made for something a bit different than the sort of robotic Dragnet approach. The mystery itself is not too deep and the final chase and shoot-out certainly won't rank amongst the classics of crime cinema but during it's brief running time The Tattooed Stranger more than held my interest. 
 Very heart warming and uplifting movie. Outstanding performance by Alisan Porter (Curly Sue). I saw this movie when it was first released and enjoyed it immensely. I just caught it again on the Mplex channel and Curly Sue touched my heart again. 
 I remember this show as it became a regular viewing on a Saturday evening. Sabrina is a young girl who moves in with her aunts who as it turns out are witches and she is one to. So Sabrina must learn how to control hr powers and use them effectively. She also must deal with school a vicious rival named Libby her ditsy best friend and boyfriend Harvey Kinkle... The show was funny and entertaining. It kept Saturday evenings entertaining for a 10 year old boy..and made him laugh out loud...And flirt with 'Libby'.... 
 Writer/director Henry Brommel has done a wonderful job with his film Panic from the year 2000 and that includes his choice of cast: William H. Macy Tracy Ullman John Ritter Neve Campbell Donald Sutherland Barbara Bain David Dorfman. Brommel has cast Ullman and Ritter in decidedly un-funny roles and the offbeat casting is a welcome change from what we normally see. Panic is the story of a hit man Alex (Macy) who actually works for his father (Sutherland). He covers his true profession by doing mail order work; by all appearances he and his wife (Ullman) and their son Sammy (Dorfman) are a typical suburban family. Unhappy with his life Alex seeks the help of a psychiatrist (Ritter) telling only his mother (Bain). In the waiting room he meets a young woman (Campbell) to whom he is immediately attracted which complicates his situation further. His mother breaks her promise and tells his father about the psychiatrist. When Alex receives his next assignment he discovers that he is to kill his psychiatrist. This is a profound story of a gentle good man made into a killer by a monster of a father with his mother's knowledge who kills to please his father but also can't stand up to him and quit. His rage is so deep-seated that he has lost emotional attachment to just about everything and everyone except his son - and it's finally his son who wakes him up out of a nearly lifelong repression. When it's time for Panic to moves it does - quickly. Panic doesn't seem panicked at all. In fact it moves very slowly. But it moves slowly not because it's poorly made - the slowness is deliberate mirroring Alex's own psyche slowly coming out of the fog. By making a decision about Sara the Campbell character and by seeing his mark his own psychiatrist as a living breathing human being Alex starts to make the connections between what he does and who he is -and how they don't jive. And the difference between the two could lead to the loss of another psyche Sammy's. William Macy gives another brilliant performance as a loving father a distant husband and a cold killer the child of two monsters who never cared a damn for his feelings or desires a man who realizes finally that he has to step up to the plate or have the cycle repeated. This is not the kind of drama that plays well in a movie theater. It's too adult too small too subtle too character-driven and too good. 
 You got to go and dig those holes. Holes only leaves troble which makes a movie so good. Disney has done it again.Shia LaBeouf should be nominated for Best Actor for his performance as Stanley Yelnats. He has alredy won the Daytime Emmy for Best Actor in a Comedy Series (Even Stevens). Holes is one of the best movies in 2003. 
 Hollywood North is an euphemism from the movie industry as they went to Canada to make movies because of tax breaks and cheaper costs in a civilized city like Toronto in this case later in Vancouver. Peter O'Brian the director probably saw a lot of the invaders from California that this movie seems to be the right way to deal with the arriving personalities trying to capitalize on the economics that Canada presented. Needless to say Moon Lantern the successful novel written by a Canadian author is turned into Flight to Bogota which has nothing to do with the original film. A great egotistical has-been Michael Baytes who is obsessed with what is happening in Iran is offered the lead part which turns to be a disaster. The film seems to be saying that too many cooks have spoiled the broth which seems to be the case with the ultimate product which is saved by its producer Bobby Myers. With the help of Sandy Ryan who has been around making a documentary of the film being shot in Toronto parts of the film are transformed into a cohesive movie at last. The filming process is hilarious and the acting in general is good. 
 This tragicomedy written by famous Serbian theatre/film writer Dusan Kovacevic is probably one of the best movies ever made in the comedy category. And yet its appearance of a theatre play transformed into a feature film takes nothing of its value. A masterpiece one should not miss to see (preferably with subtitles and not dubbed). In an aged bus en route to capital Belgrade a looming war decides the passengers' behaviour. Two Gypsy musicians sing of their miserable life but also foresee a tragedy to come; their singing both divides and connects stages in this extraordinary road movie (real life Kostic brothers are amateur actors but together with Stanojlo Milinkovic as farmer who's plowed the road give a real-life performance). The spectrum of characters gives a brilliant image of a society facing a war an insight into nation's collective person: everyone is aware that war is just about to begin but they try to live their own lives the best they can hoping that ignorance might avert the tragedy. Using a simple movie language director Slobodan Sijan paints a picture of society torn by previous war (World War I) but also highlights personal portraits with success: provincialism of a singer inexperience of the newlyweds seriousness of the Great War veteran who is on way to visit his recently conscripted son and gloomy predictions from a man who seems to be a German spy. Brilliant in its narration with memorable soundtrack (especialy the Gispsy songs) and adjusted atmosphere well photographed and edited this feature (Sijan's feature debut) was only an introduction into a series of the directors bitter-sweet comedies that will define Serbian cinematography of the 1980s: Maratonci trce pocasni krug Kako sam sistematski unisten od idiota and my other director's favourite Davitelj protiv davitelja ). 
 I had the TV on for a white noise companion and heard $400 for a fully furnished apartment So I ran into the TV room expecting another 70's flick and got much more. Luckily I could rewind to the beginning (DVR buffer) and hit the record button to watch it entirely.(Cinemax uncut and in HD no less!) Aside from some holes in the story and intermittent improbable dialog/events this is an effective thriller worthy of your time to watch. Pretty creepy and progressive at times: Beverly D'Angelo's character masturbates in front of Alison Parker played adroitly by Cristina Raines Parker stabs in very gory fashion her father an explicit menage a trios scene.( don't let the kids watch) The film is TOTALLY 70's full of bad clothes(polyester suits and tacky ascots) and decor bad hair over bloated music score and familiar looking cinematography. The cast is excellent take a second on this film's home page to check it out.It was a surprise to see Christopher Walken Jerry Orbach and Jeff Goldblum so young. Sylvia Miles- always wonderfully creepy! ENJOY! 
 The release of TARZAN THE APE MAN in 1932 caused a sensation. It may be hard to believe 70 years later but the film had much of the same kind of impact as THE MATRIX or THE LORD OF THE RINGS has achieved at a time when movies and radio were the major sources of entertainment. Tarzan became an instant pop icon the 'noble savage' that every woman fantasized about and every man wished he could be. The only person unhappy about the situation was Edgar Rice Burroughs who while he'd agreed to MGM's creative liberties and enjoyed his hefty royalty checks felt the 'dumbed down' version of his character (with no plans to allow him to 'grow') was unfaithful to his vision (he would start a production company and soon be making his own 'Tarzan' films). MGM realizing the value of it's newest 'star' knew the sequel would have to be even more spectacular than the original...and TARZAN AND HIS MATE delivered! The film had an interesting back story; Cedric Gibbons MGM's legendary Art Director had gotten a commitment from the studio to direct the sequel prior to the release of TARZAN THE APE MAN despite the fact that he'd NEVER directed before (the studio hadn't anticipated the film's impact and didn't think a novice director would matter much on a 'novelty' film...and they wanted to keep their Oscar-winning department chief happy). Gibbons a prodigiously talented and imaginative visual artist loved the freedom of pre-Code Hollywood and decided to have TARZAN AND HIS MATE 'push the envelope' to the limit...Tarzan and Jane would frolic in a nude swim and Jane would appear TOPLESS through most of the film. Maureen O'Sullivan said in an interview shortly before her death in 1998 that while a double was used for the swim she trusted the studio and did 'a couple of days' of filming sans top...but it became too much of a headache trying to strategically place plants and fruit to block her nipples and the idea was abandoned (the film shot those days would be worth a fortune!) She did do a nude silhouette scene in a tent flashed her breasts at the conclusion of her 'swim' and donned a revised 'jungle' costume that was extremely provocative very thin and open at the sides...and the resulting outcry would help 'create' the Hays Office and the self-censorship that would soon engulf the entire industry. MGM yanked Gibbons from the production (the 'official' reason given was his workload as Art Director) and veteran Jack Conway was listed as the new director to appease the critics...although James C. McKay actually directed the film as Conway was busy on 3 other projects including VIVA VILLA! The film incorporated the best elements of the original (safaris murderous tribes Tarzan fighting jungle beasts to the death to save Jane) and actually improved on the storytelling. Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) from the first film returns to Africa for ivory from the 'Elephants' Graveyard' and to try to seduce Jane into returning to England with gifts of silk dresses underwear and perfume. He brings with him Martin Arlington (Paul Cavanagh) a crack shot and inveterate womanizer who sneers at Holt's chivalrous pursuit of Jane and stalks her as a potential 'conquest' to be had by any means (including killing Tarzan if and when he can get away with it without being seen). Tarzan barely tolerates the intrusion into his happy life with Jane and puts his foot down refusing to allow the hunters into the Graveyard. Arlington finds his opportunity catching the Ape Man alone and shoots him then returns to the camp with a fabricated story of his demise. Now Jane has no reason to remain in the jungle and she can direct them to the Graveyard before her long voyage back to England comforted by the oh-so-sympathetic Arlington. But a savage tribe and hideous torture await the group...can Tarzan being nursed back to health by his ape 'family' recover in time to save Jane? While stock footage is again used extensively the racial stereotypes of the 30s are apparent and the gorillas are obviously actors in ape suits TARZAN AND HIS MATE achieves a level of sophistication unsurpassed in any other 'Tarzan' film as well as a sexiness that even Bo Derek's blatantly erotic TARZAN THE APE MAN couldn't touch. Johnny Weissmuller was in peak condition physically Maureen O'Sullivan was never more beautiful and 'Africa' never looked more romantic and dangerous. TARZAN AND HIS MATE was a triumph (although it would be drastically edited for many years) and remains THE classic of the series to this day! 
 First of all this was not a three hour movie - Two hours ten minutes... last time i checked commercials aren't actually part of a movie! Perhaps though it should've been a two parter for a total of about 3 hours? Yeah would have gotten more in been able to explore some more emotion. Overall though it was an interesting look into the lives of Lucy and Desi. I watch I Love Lucy from time to time and love it but never have I read or seen a biography never knew anything about their lives off the screen. Because of this movie I do now but I'm not so sure that's a good thing. Everything here no one really needed to know. This was essentially a movie that didn't need to be made. But it was made and the reason is because Lucy & Desi are still such huge stars and certain people in American society feel that the rest of society needs to know ALL about our tv and movie stars. That is definitely so not true and very very sad. Anyway what was shown here in Lucy was pretty good. Two complaints - the actress who played Viv Vance - not great casting at all. And the switch from Madeline Zima to Rachel York.... uhhh like Lucy had plastic surgery and all of a sudden she's a whole new person!? That wasn't too great. But the story went on and focused on the rocky relationship between Lucy & Desi. No the kids were not shown very much at all and that wasn't necessarily a drawback to this movie because like I said this focused mainly just on Lucy & Desi. Had there been more time had the story been more about Lucy's entire life then maybe the kids woulda been there more. But they weren't so we got to see the likes of Gable & Lombard Red Skelton and Buster Keaton very briefly instead. Wow that was one thing about this story that I thought was really cool: his presence and influence in Lucy's life. Really neat and it's too bad that wasn't explored more. Oh well. What was explored was done well for the most part. Honestly I don't think I'll ever watch this again and I don't think this movie'll be that memorable. For someone who digs I Love Lucy but isn't an enormous Lucille Ball fan this should be an interesting watch. My grade for this: B 
 Ben Thomas (Smith) plays an IRS Agent who practically gives the store away to everyone's surprise. What kind of IRS Agent is this? Most of us have all heard the line by an IRS Agent Hello I'm from the IRS. I'm here to help. Our smile then spreads into a chuckle that says Yeah right. As you get further and further into this story you cannot figure this guy out. He goes easy on those who are being audited. What is his motive? Is he from another planet an angel a rich guy who wants to do good? He helps so much we want him to be our auditor should we get audited of course. Hey IRS are you listening? (kidding just kidding) The pace of the movie is perfect and so much so that clues were ignored that would have told me what was really going on. Intense repeat intense focus was on Ben and stays there. The whole movie only works because of Ben as we try to figure him out and I didn't see any clues (what clues you talking about Willis?). Not reading the box before watching the DVD movie was the better way to go here. By the end of the movie I finally put it all together. Well it was obvious by then. And yes it's over the top but still a great story mostly because of Will Smith. Will Smith should have been nominated for a Best Actor Award. The rest of the cast were very good as well. Yes it's over the top and despite the great acting and when you finally get all the answers you must realize that the message of the movie is all wrong. What's the message? Believe me you will won't need too many clues to figure it out. I didn't. Violence: No. Sex: Yes but nothing to get excited about. Bland. Nudity: No. Language: No. 
 i say the domino principle is an enormously underappreciated film.anyone who has taken the time to investigate our contemporary history of conspiracies;jfk rfk mlk g.wallace and in fact numerous others can only draw the conclusion that the author of the domino principle really knew what he was talking about.roy tucker could be lee harvey oswald or james earl ray or sirhan sirhan or arthur bremer maybe even john hinkley or timothy mcveigh.to mention a few.the conspiracy scenario involving spies big business and political assassinations is not really a fiction but an ominous part of our convoluted existential history.god help us but the domino principle is more fact than fantasy.if this causes a little loss of sleep maybe it should.don't take my word for it investigate for yourselves. 
 Despite its low-key release in this country and its apparent disregard in other countries (the 'R' rating in the States can't have helped - honestly just because HBC uses the C-word!) this is actually a fine piece of work. The sentimentality does occasionally threaten to choke it but it's overcome by the playing of the two leads. It's easy to win plaudits just because you're playing a physical or mental cripple (Daniel Day-Lewis Geoffrey Rush Dustin Hoffman etc.) and Helena Bonham-Carter may not quite capture the physical degradation of MND but her vocal stretching and ruthless emotional drive compensate entirely. In fact almost all her performance is conducted through her eyes (and what eyes!). This is an intelligent turn from an actress who is rapidly undoing her English Rose reputation and emerging as a figure of some stature. Awards must surely follow though not alas for this fine performance. Branagh one feels has never quite given his best on film (except possibly 'Hamlet' and there his playing was diluted by the large cast). Here though he tops his other appearances playing to the hilt a self-loathing unstable ultimately lovable guy with a subtlety he hasn't always displayed and exhibiting both intelligence and depth. In short we believe him just as much as we could NOT believe him as Frankenstein as the priest in 'The Proposition' as the lawyer in 'The Gingerbread Man' even as Andrew in 'Peter's Friends'. This is surely his finest performance yet - so why could he not produce the goods much earlier? As a film it looks more like a television offering and without its stars it probably wouldn't amount to very much. But it's been a pleasure to see this pair perform their socks off like this and I eagerly await more from them (though not 'Love's Labour's Lost'...). 8 out of 10 but Branagh and HBC get 10 out of 10. 
 Robot jox is a great little film ok some of the sets are bad and the acting is not that great but the special effects are very good for a film of this size and age. You have to remember that this film is over 10 years old now and was made very cheaply in the 1st place so you cant moan to much about the bad parts. So just sit back and watch a cool film with great big robots in it. 
 A mess of genres but it's mainly based on Stephen Chow's genre mash-ups for it's inspiration. There's magic kung-fu college romance sports gangster action and some weepy melodrama for a topping. The production is excellent and the pacing is fast so it's easy to get past the many flaws in this film. A baby is abandoned next to a basketball court. A homeless man brings him to a Shaolin monastery that's in the middle of a city along with a special kung fu manual that the homeless man somehow has but can't read. The old monk teaches the boy but expires when he tries to master the special technique in the manual. The school is taken over by a phony kung fu master who is assisted by four wacky monks. The new master gets mad at the now 20+ year old boy for not pretending to be hurt by the master's weak punches and throws him out for the night. The boy is found throwing garbage into a basket from an incredible distance by a man who bring him to a gangster's club to play darts. This leads to a big fight the boy's expulsion from the monastery and the man's decision to turn the boy into a college basketball sensation. Al this happens in the first 20 minutes with most of it happening in the first 10 minutes. Aside from the extreme shorthand storytelling the first problem is how little we get to know the main character until way into the movie. The man who uses the boy is more sharply defined by the time the first third is over. The plot follows no new ground except for the insane action climax of the film. I'm sure you can easily imagine how the wacky monks will show up towards the end. The effects photography and stunt work are all top- notch and make up for the uninspired plot. Stephen Chow has a much better command of plot and comedy writing and this film will live in his shadow but that's not a good reason to ignore it. It's quite entertaining even with a scatter-shot ending. Recommended. 
 Sort of like a very primitive episode of General Hospital set in a natal ward (and one for tough cases at that) this fast-moving programmer has a satisfying emotional impact -- mainly because Eric Linden as the distraught young husband in the main plot is so palpably a wreck and with such good reason. His expectant wife Loretta Young is brought to the ward at the beginning of a 20-year prison sentence for offing a lecher who probably had it coming to him; Ms. Young as always doesn't do anything to disinvite audience sympathy and she's a little too good to be true though sympathetic and lovely to look at of course. Her difficult pregnancy and relationships with the other girls of the ward form the heart of the movie and the outcome -- not an entirely happy one -- feels right. Aline MacMahon one of the cinema's few perfect actresses in the apt words of film historian David Thomson exudes warmth and authority as the head nurse and Glenda Farrell as a none-too-willing new mom of twins gets to croon Frankie and Johnny as a drunken lullaby. Frank McHugh figures in another subplot and he gets to show more range than Warners usually permitted him. It's scaled and paced modestly and Linden's expectant-dad panic stays with you for days -- this sort of part was often played for laughs but he's a terrified young kid in trouble and very persuasive. 
 I watched this movie alongwith my complete family of Nine. Since my younger brother has recently got married we could connect with the goings-on. The movie stands out for the classical touch given to the romance of the engaged couple. Thankfully this time all Indian locales like Ranikhet Almora etc have been used which have been already visited by most of the urbanites hence adding to the connection with movie. The dialogues are much better than those in the Umrao Jaan Ada - a supposedly dialogue based movie. The background music is augmenting the soft focus of the movie. It somehow remind me of VV Chopra's Kareeb in which neha and to some extent Bobby did full justice to the character. Same here in that the lead pair does not disappoint in any department-looks or acting. The Supporting cast are too good. I rate the actress playing the role of Bhabhi in the front league. The situations of family interactions portrayed are real and you smile when you find yourself in place of one of the characters. Songs were too suiting the scenes and going along well with the movie. However though I respect Ravindra Jain for his body of work from movies to Ramayana I missed Ram Laxman badly. It had no double entendres(Sivan category) no bikinis no intrigue and no nonsense. You would comfortably watch the movie with your parents except if you're already or going to be soon engaged. I want to express on candid thing here that though Suraj proposes that the marriages is between families and not only individuals his approach is totally individualistic. The movie is only about Prem & Poonam rest of the characters are incidental. Art immitating life? The peripheral characters are consigned to the background and the only protagonists are the lead pair. Coming back Everything was almost great. Except for the drama part. The situation of tragedy was artificially created. The outcome the sacrifice and the ensuing heart change are not compelling at all. That is why it lacks the emotional punch-the very purpose of this turn of events. But a twist in the tale was necessary to transcend the movie from a beautiful pre-marital video to a 'feature film'. But I kept waiting for the punch and it never came. The preaching by Mohnish Bahal and later by Alok Nath on dowry was out of place and it made things too overboard. May be this will help the movie a tax-free status. But the plot could have been made more interesting and non-linear than what it was. There were too question in my mind when the movie ended: 1 Has the movie really ended? 2 Has the movie ended? 
 By Hook or By Crook is a tremendously innovative film from a pair of immensely smart and talented filmmakers Harry Dodge and Silas Howard. They manage to tell an original story in a distinctive cinematic style and it's beautifully shot by Ann T. Rosetti and wonderfully written -- truly poetic. The lead characters are true heroes and serve as a rare kind of role model/inspiration for butch dykes and trannies everywhere. This film has so much energy so much poignant passion and scruffy San Francisco heart to it. I can't recommend it highly enough! The best butch buddy movie of all time! 
 OK this movie starts out like a cheesy Lifetime movie and doesn't get better till almost well through the movie. The script is full of 'cheese' and 'fluff' and cast is not well directed for the most part. For the first half of the movie the little girl grated on my nerves. I do not think this is one of her best acting jobs. The only reason I bought the movie is because it was on sale and had Ellen Burstyn in it. She's terrific but this is also not one of her best acting gigs. The story is based on true events and that helps the movie. Actually I didn't even like the movie at first and was getting disgusted when I saw stills of the balloon traveling I mean..let it get where it's suppose to go and be done with it! But all is forgiven by the time it does reach it's destination and the story comes to a close. If this doesn't bring a tear to your eye nothing will! It's cheesy and predictable but also makes you feel good about the world again.

 My comment would have been added to the RELEASE DATE section but I couldn't find a place for it. I was really surprised to see that this movie was released in the U.S. in Feb. 1955. I saw it in a first run theater in Washington D.C. in March 1958. Wonder if it was re-released or some problem? In my opinion this movie is very light entertainment but has some classic characters. John McIntyre does a bang-up job as a corrupt judge/entrepreneur/thief. Walter Brennan does basically the same role he did in Red River years earlier. And in my opinion James Stewart gives as fine a performance as he ever did. I have seen this movie a half dozen times or more and never tire of seeing parts of it again. The photography and scenery are splendid and it offers a remarkable amount of entertainment in one hour and thirty-six minutes. 
 There's more to offer in the opening of The Odd Couple than in the entirety of most films. Felix Unger (the poor guy's monogram even curses him) checks into a New York hotel. A cleaning lady says Good night. Goodbye he answers back. In his room he empties his pockets then struggles to take off his wedding ring only to put the objects neatly into an envelope addressed to his wife and beloved children. When the viewer finally puts it together ? aha he's going to off himself ? we watch him struggle to open the window ? oh no he's going to jump ? The poor guy injures his lower back. This is all you need to know about Felix Unger ? his wife has left him he's a compulsive cleaner and he's a hypochondriac. And all in one scene. This is the particular genius of Neil Simon's comedy ? it's about situation and character. There are few obvious physical jokes ? no kicks to the groin no cheap gags ? just funny characters in uncomfortable situations. And of course he is a master of manipulating the audience's expectations. Coming from the Swingers era imagine what I thought in the date scene when Felix starts lamenting about the breakup of his marriage to the girls his roommate Oscar has worked so hard to get into his apartment. He's blowing it right? Think again. The girls love his sensitivity his ability to cry in front of them. They invite him back to their place since his meatloaf has burned because Oscar wasn't paying enough attention to it. He's in like Flynn right? Uh yes but he doesn't want to go with the girls because he's feeling vulnerable. Great stuff. And it's made even greater with a style that minimizes editing and maximizes the wonderful eight-room apartment set. You've got Jack Lemmon and the slouchy pouchy Walter Matthau for Chrissakes why mess it up? The visual style reminded me of Breakfast at Tiffany's in that great effect is made from a large depth of field and the interplay between the various planes of action. Particularly memorable is the scene in which Felix fleeing from Oscar closes a partition only to realize the partition doesn't cover the side where Oscar is coming from. You get a real sense of the layout of the apartment and thus the proximity in which the two divorc¨¦es live. The twist here is that these two are really married ? to each other. So the observations about married life that might be ignored in an ordinary romantic comedy are made all the more poignant since they are two guys. 
 A number of contributors have mentioned the age difference between Stewart and Novak. She was 25 and he was 50 when this movie was released. I think that the difference didn't matter for a suspense drama like Vertigo but it does matter for a romantic comedy. We can easily understand that is why his character would be attracted to hers but it's less clear why hers would be attracted to his. Still the movie works as a light romantic fantasy. The scene where she stares at him across the cat's head with her dark painted-on eyebrows flaring and the sounds of her humming and the cat purring is true magic. It's a little jarring therefore when the scene shifts to the top of the Flatiron Building and we see the age difference very sharply. As he embraces her she reaches up to run her fingers through his hair but stops that motion and just brushes her fingertips lightly against his toupee. 
 Not wishing to give *anything* away here I would just say this technically excellent flawlessly acted and uplifting little flic will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a half's entertainment: It will amuse surprise possibly embarrass occasionally and almost certainly tug at the heartstrings from time to time as it approaches the inevitable but not obvious ending without becoming clich¨¦d or predictable in any way. Most definitely recommended. A previous User's Comment gives 8 out of 10 for the film and 10 out of 10 for both Branagh and Bonham-Carter's outstanding performances - I agree entirely.... 
 I saw this kung fu movie when I was a kid and I thought it was so cool! Now I am 26 years old and my friend has it on DVD!!! We got a case of brew and watched this classic! It lost NONE of it's original kung fu coolness! If you are a fan of kung fu/karate movies this is a must see... the DVD is available. I believe this movie is also called Pick Your Poison . Watch it soon! 
 I never had an inkling while watching the movie that it was meant for the idiot box. I always thought that this was some very good successful movie of the late 90's. But after I saw on the internet that this was meant for the TV I was shocked because for a television film it is absolutely fantastic! The thing that mostly concerned me was the length. I felt that the one on one battle scene should've been removed as it was completely unnecessary. Also it began to drag towards the end as it seemed as if the adventure was never going to end. On the plus side there is a strong very interesting and captivating plot with magnificent performances by everyone. I just felt that Patrik Frayze looked a bit haggard. I also felt that Gogool who looked dementing turned a bit stupid at some scenes. I was delighted by the beautiful landscapes of Africa. Also the first half of the movie would have made me give this movie a 9. Still its a great film for the television. 8 out of 10. 
 This is an entertaining look at the Gospel as presented by Johnny Cash (adorned in black of course) who sings a lot and narrates a bit also. If you like Johnny Cash this film is quite enjoyable. Also note the blonde depiction of Jesus in this work...just for fun try to think of five Jewish men who have blonde hair...? Anyway its a fun presentation of the greatest and most important story of all. 
 ...but the general moviegoer's mileage may vary in Mary American Psycho Harron's stylized look at the American sexual psyche as seen through the lens of the immortal Queen of Curves Bettie Page. I'll not bore anyone with a recitation of the iconic status of Ms. Page a prim and proper valedictorian from Nashville Tennessee who moved to New York in hopes of being an actress and ended up becoming the Bondage Queen of the Universe. Nor will I run through the sketchy bio-pic plot of The Notorious Bettie Page though I offer high kudos to the technical aspects of the film (a sequence of animated magazine covers springs instantly to mind) improper use of a period camera notwithstanding. Finally I won't belabor the timely applicability of the film's themes of innocence and perversion freedom and control the sacred and the secular; they're there for the viewer to absorb if they wish. The more things change the more they stay the same as the saying goes. What I will ramble on about for a moment is the splendid performance of Gretchen Mol as Bettie Page. Truth is Mol's face looks almost nothing like Bettie's nor is she particularly built like Bettie (although only a fool would deny those beautiful breasts and no fool I!). She doesn't even sport the thick dark bush that concealed Ms. Page's most intimate charms but the fact remains that Mol thoroughly embodies the spirit of Bettie Page in every way shape and form. It is a bravura comeback from an undeserved semi-obscurity. I've never met Ms. Page (and sadly never will most likely) but I've devoured the photos and videos and read all the bios and interviews available bought the trading cards and other odds and ends and to be honest lusted for Ms. Page ever since I first discovered her in my adolescence between the covers of dusty tease magazines at the barber shop and the five and dime. Mol perfectly captures the essence of the woman as I have come to conceive her no pun intended in what I consider to be an Oscar-worthy performance. Liv Tyler could never have matched Mol's shining intensity of characterization in a million years and I for one am grateful she left the project. Not that I'd mind seeing her totally naked I hasten to add but I can't imagine that her brand of sensuality would have translated into the innocent exhuberance of Bettie Page. The Notorious Bettie Page is not for everyone any more than bondage and discipline are. I suspect it will do much better on disc than in the theaters; legions of devoted Page fans and the curious will see to that. I can only hope that the DVD will be chock full of enough Bettie extras to show the uninitiated just how good a job Mol has done. Beyond that a tip of the hat to a fine supporting cast especially Lili Taylor and Chris Bauer as Paula and Irving Klaw whose celebrity photo business was Bettie's doorway to immortality. A final note to the young scribe who opined that Ms. Page had no effect on his generation: take a good look at Madonna's cone brassiere and get back to us. Bettie Page is whether you know it or not the true Godmother of fetishwear. Without her Madonna and the rest of her kin could never have existed. 
 Despite of the success in comedy or drama the Turkish directors are failure in horror-thriller. Okul-D@bbe are good examples for the awful horror Turkish films. But if you watch Gen you will understand that it is a strike. The atmosphere of the movie is impressive and dark. Also the special features are colorful and not cheap. The soundtracks fit the movie but the script is not totally perfect and the theme of the movie is ordinary. As a result Gen does not add any difference to horror movies but it does not disappoint thriller fans. In this respect it is a success for Yesilcam and Turkey. (7/10) 
 The performances in this movie were fantastic. The dialogue was great. Jason Patric delivered a fantastic performance as Kid Collins in this wonderful adaptation of the Jim Thompson novel. Far superior to The Grifters which was a good movie this film really stayed true to the pulp fiction/film noir roots from which the story came. I recommend this movie to all film noir fans. 
 The plot is real horrific the atmosphere really depressive unusual for a low-budget production like that and at least for a German production. A little bit of Indian spirituality mystic thriller and slasher movie mixed together. The development of plot and characters are great the sets very close to reality without any studio-atmosphere. It could be perfect but at unfortunately some things were a little bit disappointing what don't inevitably have to be typically for low-budget movies: 1.) The cast sometimes is not more than average. Almost every actor look like a layman. Some of them do a good or a very good job but some are acting like the actors of crappy German court-shows! But I was very very disappointed of the acting of Mathieu Carri¨¨re! His acting ( in a lots of of his older movies his acting was fine ) here was below-average! But that could be the reason why he today takes part in crappy German soaps or TV-series on private channels. 2.) The dialogs are sometimes on soap-opera-level. 3.) The bad sound made it sometimes very hard to understand what the characters are saying. I saw it on DVD and was glad to could rewind and to listen it again. It caused by the set ( big halls as in the hospital or with the esoterically group ) and sometimes the strange dialects of the actors! But all in all it is an interesting movie worth to watch it far beyond the commercially movies which are often more terrible. 
 I saw this film by chance on the small box. It has a fantastic and chilling scene about poisonous gas. A lot about fanatical patriotism. A bit of eroticism. I can't believe it's still waiting for 5 votes!! 
 This film is worth seeing alone for Jared Harris' outstanding portrayal of John Lennon. It doesn't matter that Harris doesn't exactly resemble Lennon; his mannerisms expressions posture accent and attitude are pure Lennon. Best scene: Lennon in a local cafe verbally sparring with a stuttering fan as to whether Paul McCartney & Wings' Silly Love Songs is worthy of #1 status in America. 
 George and Kim are traveling with their young son Miles to a remote cabin in upstate New York when their car hits a deer and swerves into a ditch.But what seems to be a mere occurrence of misfortune marks the beginning of a terrifying journey where myth becomes reality and a flesh-eating spirit half animal and half man Wendigo haunts a small town... Wendigo by Larry Fessenden is a thought-provoking horror film that often tenderfoot's into a somber family drama.The acting is great the characters are well-developed and there are some bone-chilling moments.The subtle glimpses of Wendigo are handled effectively and it's never clear what is real and what is imagined or even if the story is taking place entirely in Miles' head.Overall Wendigo is my first contact with Larry Fessenden's work and surely won't be the last.Give this film a chance if you don't mind watching something unconventional.8 out of 10. 
 I saw this film at the Taos Film Festival last year and was just overwhelmed by it. It's a rich warm novel brought to the screen beautifully acted and well directed. More than anything it reminded me of the films of David Lean both in its ability to handle a complex story and its knack for creating powerful scenes that affect you on several different levels. The best movie I've seen in years. 
 I remember when this film was up for the Academy Awards and did not win in any category. For the life of me I cannot remember what it was up against but one thing I can say: It was one of the best movies I have ever seen. And the fact that Steven Spielberg directed the film did not persuade me one bit. Essentially it is about a black woman's trials and tribulations as she is growing up from a girl to a woman. There are a lot of insinuations that are disturbing and horrifying but all of them are needed to see how much this woman has put up with. Along the way we see other women who have had to put up with their hardships and walk with them to redemption. Whoopi Goldberg gives her best performance ever in this movie. Danny Glover should have also gotten at least nominated for his role in this film. And the best part of this movie is that it treats its subjects humanely not like some sideshow freak shows like the more recent Beloved did. I encourage anyone of any race to see this film. 9/10 
 its not as good as the first movie but its a good solid movie its has good car chase scenes on the remake of this movie there a story for are hero to drive fast as his trying to rush to the side of his ailing wife the ending is great just a good fair movie to watch in my opinion  
 Coonskin might be my favorite Ralph Bakshi film. Like the best of his work it's in-your-face and not ashamed of it for a second but unlike some of his other work (even when he's at his finest which was before and after Coonskin with Heavy Traffic and Wizards) it's not much uneven despite appearances to the contrary. Bakshi's taking on stereotypes and perceptions of race of course but moreover he's making what appears to be a freewheeling exploitation film; blaxploitation almost though Bakshi doesn't stop just there. If it were just a blaxploitation flick with inventive animation it could be enough for a substantial feature. But Bakshi's aims are higher: throwing up these grotesque and exaggerated images of not just black people but Italians/mafioso homosexuals Jews overall New York-types in the urban quarters of Manhattan in the 70s he isn't out to make anything realistic. The most normal looking creation in looking drawn real is in fact a naked woman painted red white and blue. In mocking these stereotypes and conventions and horrible forms of racism (i.e. the tar-rabbit baby joke yes joke plus black-face) we're looking at abstraction to a grand degree. And best of all Bakshi doesn't take himself too seriously unlike Spike Lee with a film like Bamboozled in delivering his message. This is why for the most part Coonskin is a hilarious piece of work where some of the images and things done and sudden twists and of course scenes of awkward behavior (I loved the scene where the three animated characters are being talked at by the real-life white couple in tux and dress as looking colorful and the like) are just too much not to laugh at. It's not just the imagery which is in and of itself incredibly over -stylized but that the screenplay is sharp and this is key for Bakshi this time considering it's got a fairly cohesive narrative to string along the improvisations and madness. Using at first live-action then animation and then an extremely clever matching of the two (ironically what Bakshi later went for in commercial form with Cool World is done here to a T with less money and a rougher edge) Pappy and Randy are waiting outside a prison wall for a buddy to escape and Pappy tells of the story of Brother Rabbit who with Brother Bear and Preacher Fox go to Harlem and become big-time hoodlums with Rabbit in direct opposition to a Jabba-the-Hut-esquire Godfather character. This is obviously a take off on Song of the South with its intentionally happy-go-lucky plot and animation here taken apart and shown for how rotten and offensive it really is. Yet Bakshi goes for broke in combining forms; animated characters stand behind and move along with live-action backgrounds; when violence and gunshots and fights occurs it's as bloody as it can get for 1975; when a dirty cop is at a bar and is drugged and put in black-face and a dress he trips in a manner of which not even Disney could reach with Dumbo; a boxing match with Brother Bear and an opponent as the climax is filmed in wild slow-motion; archive footage comes on from time to time of old movies some and some from the 20s that are just tasteless. Like Mel Brooks or Kubrick or more recently South Park Bakshi's Coonskin functions as entertainment first and then thought-provocation second. It's also audacious film-making on an independent scale; everything from the long takes to the montage and the endlessly warped designs for the characters (however all based on the theme of the piece) all serve the thought in the script where its B-movie plot opens up much more for interpretation. To call it racist misses the point; it's like calling Dr. Strangelove pro-atomic desolation or Confederate States of America pro slavery. And for me it's one of the best satires ever made. 
 This movie contains one of Richard Dreyfuss's greatest performances as an actor who plays a dictator and does it so convincingly that his own mother does not detect the impostor. Also this movie is funny yet has a serious side as well. What is especially intriguing about this movie is the character Madonna who is the dictator's mistress but eventually becomes the leader of the country. Madonna's evolution from mistress to political leader added greatly to the quality of the story and to the movie's entertainment value. And the main character who at the start of the movie is a struggling actor and somewhat of a buffoon evolves too and by the end of the movie commands respect. I liked this movie. 
 I saw this movie again as an assignment for my management class. Were to mainly comment on the different management styles and ideas on quality(of the product). I did rent this one back in the eighties and I remember it to be good(but not great)movie. I've always liked Michael Keaton's style and delivery. He was a perfect fit for the movie. I am surprised to see some of the low ratings for this movie. I grant you yes it's no Oscar winner but it does have decent comedic value. It's more of a subtle comedy rather than a all-out comedy farce. I also find some of those that felt this was an inaccurate film on cultural and business differences. I beg to differ. I grant you again that there are a lot of generalities and dramatizations but then again this is Hollywood film not a documentary. From what I've read about differences between Automakers on both sides of the Pacific at that time many of the principle ideas were accurate for the time. Some of the basic differences were that Japanese workers made to feel as part of the company as a whole. Teamwork was emphasized. They perhaps made the company above all else. Where American workers had more of a management verses labor type of relationship. The individual was more important than the company. I'll probably get some hate email over that comment I'm sure. Another difference was how quality was viewed and whose responsibility it was to fix. In many Japanese plants defects or problems are examined and fixed at the time it is discovered. Rather as one character in the movie put it it was the dealers(meaning car dealer) problem . Many of these things are probably dated but I'm sure some are still around as many US car makers are still struggling to keep up with the Japanese. If one is more interested in the subject of American European and Japanese automakers I can recommend a book that studies this subject in more detail and was done around the same time period. The book is called The machine that changed the world by James Womack Daniel Jones and Daniel Roos. It's about a study of automakers during and before the time period that this movie covers. Parts are bit dry but I think you'll find that it backs up much the movie also. 
 Two great comedians in a great Neil Simon movie based on his hit play. Great combination especially when the comedians in question are Matthau and Burns. Small wonder why Burns won an Oscar for this; he's as sharp and as funny as ever. And Matthau is every bit his match if a tad more crotchety. This is familiar Simon territory: two old vaudeville partners reunite for a TV special but still can't stand one another after all these years. It's a delight to watch these two pick at each other their scenes together make this film an absolute delight. Myself I especially enjoyed the knock knock knock / ENTER! scene. And if you're a fan of either Burns or Matthau you'll enjoy it too. In fact you'll enjoy the whole movie. Ten stars. Put a little Sunshine in your life. 
 if you like gangster type of movies then this is the first one you should buy or at least rent Al Pacino his performance is top notch. and the story is classic!! 10 / 10 !!!! Why isn't this movie in the TOP 250 list?? 
 I LOVED this flick when it came out in the 80's and still do! I still quote classic lines like say it again and you said you'd rip my balls off sir . Ron Leibman was hot and very funny! Although it was underrated and disowned by MAD I have to say that this little gem will always be a treasure of mine and a movie that I would take with me if sent to a deserted island! I only wish that someone would release the DVD because my VHS tape is about worn out! If you like cheesed out comedy this is definitely for you and should be considered a cult classic! It is military humor at it's best and worse! Rent it if you can't own it! 
 This film is really cool. every thing looks like it came out of the comic book. the sets the costumes and the plot is great. Clark Bartram is again our favorite batman. he looked a bit better in dead end but he still pulls it off. superman is great too. the flying effects are OK. but its a fan-film so we cant expect them to be the greatest. the shot with superman catching the car was VERY believable. it was cool. This is a movie i would definitely see if it were real. its got every thing you would want in a batman/ superman movie. one exception though i would cast the joker instead of 2-face..... overall i give this film a 10 because its a great film. 
 I feel like I have some uber-rare disease that no one has heard of and I have finally come across a support group on the net! I finally found this title by asking for an answer on an experts site on the web. I too saw this movie in my youth and was struck by the atmosphere and especially the ending. I have never forgotten it and have never seen it since. No one I know saw the film and I had almost given up on ever finding it's title. Alas even knowing the name I shall probably never see the film again as it is impossible to find commercially. Small steps... G 
 Grand epic as it is Kenneth Branagh's monumental rendering of what is perhaps William Shakespeare's most popular tragedy suffers under the weight of its four hour playing time and certainly takes some real staying power. Two entirely separate sittings would most likely be better in order to fully appreciate what is certainly high class film making. While I absolutely acknowledge this masterpiece as such I must confess to a lack of enthusiasm for the old bards flamboyance his rhetoric (and he sends himself up so well) and his many flourishes. Thus Hamlet loses its impact as it loses its grip. From Patrick Doyle's music to Alex Thomson's cinematography to Tim Harvey's exquisite sets the movie is a feast of visual and aural delights which compliments a fine cast. Branagh has taken on three huge mantels adapting directing and playing. His adaptation is superb his direction strong but by the time he got to the role of Hamlet the strain seemed to be showing; yet still he does a fine job in what is an incredibly taxing role. Derek Jacobi gobbles up the sinister Claudius with glee and Julie Christie is most dramatic as his queen Gertrude. Richard Briers is marvellous as Polonius and Charlton Heston is once again a strong screen influence as the player King. Many others drop by including Jack Lemmon (superb in a very small role) Billy Crystal Dame Judi Dench Sir John Mills Sir John Gielgud Sir Richard Attenborough and Gerard Depardieu. The acting prize though must go to one of the great thespian discoveries of recent years Kate Winslet. Hers is a moving portrayal of the most tragic figure in this whole affair Ophelia. To finish (before this review goes on longer than the film) I must say it is the length that really tests the viewer in this movie. Branagh has directed with purpose giving many important impacting scenes. Too many of them outstay their welcome. Watching this film holds a fantastic reminder of the many pearls of wisdom we have garnered from it. Neither a lender nor a borrower be or Be true to thyself . And of course: To be or not to be . The opening two hours does take some perseverance but if you do manage to stay tuned you are sure to be treated to a rousing finale which gathers momentum from the tragic funeral onward.

 Due to reading bad reviews and being told by friends that they couldn't believe how bad it was I didn't go and see this film at the cinema. After watching it on DVD I have to say I regret that now. I'm not saying it is brilliant but I would venture to say that it is a good movie. I enjoyed it. People have skulls thicker than Ned's helmet if they go to see a movie like this and expect it to be a documentary. If you read up the actual history behind most movies based on historical figures there is usually a huge difference between the fact and the fictional portrayal. I don't think Ganghis Kahn has ever once been portrayed even remotely close to historical fact. What kind of man Ned Kelly actually was is a matter of debate and quite passionate it seems. In spite of the efforts of governments and some historians Ned Kelly has become a legend. Legends are stories and stories say as much about those who tell and listen to them as they do about the actual figure himself. Ned Kelly has become such a popular identity because he does represent that aspect of Australian culture that doesn't trust or accept authority. A society in which there is no dissent or challenge to authority is crazier and more dangerous than any bushranger. So not expecting this to be an accurate recreation of the historical Kelly gang I actually found it a surprisingly unencumbered and refreshing movie. It was sentimental and romantic but thankfully not anywhere as cheesy as it could have been; for my fellow Australians watch 'The Lighthorseman' and you will see what I mean (it is a pity the way that story was treated so poorly). Perhaps the love affair business could have been forsaken for a bit more detail in other areas such as the shooting of the troopers. Ironically I actually enjoyed the movie because of that because it would be those details that most of the focus on Ned's story would dwell. And they are the details of the story that are best discovered by reading the different viewpoints given by the various historians. This movie was always going to have a hard time having make a compromise of appealing to a global movie market (to pay the pills) and the legend as it means to Australians; perhaps a little of Ned's spirit is in this movie because I think it rebelled against people's expectations and unfortunately missed both targets. Fortunately it made for an enjoyable quirk of a film. For me it was an unexpected kind of movie about Ned and that is why I liked it. Orlando Bloom's performance did a lot for the movie too - he really added something. I think he would have enjoyed being the monster instead of the pretty elf for a change. When you consider some other movies that are far worse than this one your opinion of this movie should be reconsidered. Send me this on DVD for christmas rather than Croc Dundee or The Man From Snowy River anytime. 
 I don't hand out ten star ratings easily. A movie really has to impress me and The Bourne Ultimatum has gone far beyond that. Furthermore this trilogy has come together so nicely that I believe it to be one of the greatest motion picture trilogies of our time. Though all three films could not be any more different from the Ludlum novels they still stand as a powerful landmark in cinematic achievement. The Bourne Ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete yet I could not even attempt to stop smiling for hours. From the moment that the opening title appeared I knew we were in for a ride. Paul Greengrass has done it again. Everything we love from the previous Bourne films is here once again: the action the dialogue and of course the shaky camera. However for me that last one was never a problem. I think it adds to the suspense. I will be back to see this film several times before it is released on DVD simply because it is genius. It is a perfectly satisfying conclusion and should stand the test of time as a fantastic movie and altogether an unforgettable trilogy. 
 Ok even if you can't stand Liza- this movie is truly hilarious! The scenes with John Gielgud make up for Liza. One of the true romantic comedy classics from the 20th century. Dudley Moore makes being drunk and irresponsible look cute and amusing and it is damn fun to watch! The one-liners are the best. 
 I was never a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children. They usually lack originality and contain overacting galore. The only horror movie i like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was well-acted and had a great story. But it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining quite possibly the scariest movie ever. The movie follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. But Jack is convinced it will be OK and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block. After months of solitude and silence however Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad? One of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick makes. The hotel is very silent and the rooms are huge yet always empty. It is also eerily calm when Jack's son is riding his bike through the barren hallways. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of his very best scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile. My favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walk-in refrigerator. The Shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion beating the snot out of crap like the Ring and The Blair Witch Project. It may be a oldie but is definitely a goodie. 8/10 
 After growing up in the gritty streets of Detroit MI and having friends who traveled to New York balls I fell into the lifestyle of being a House member. I joined the House of Theieves. We adapted the same rules as most houses but we were professional crooks that would boost and commit credit card fraud to obtain the fabulous jewels and clothes we desired. I even learned how to profess the making of checks and driver's license and cash them in over seventeen states until a jealous queen called the Secret Service on me and I went to Federal prison. But I learned a lot from these queens in this movie and I highly recommend you watch it yourself. You can even read about how I grew up in the houses here in Detroit and the criminal activity we indulged in. My book Identity Schemes is available on sale at Amazon dot com or at Identity Schemes dot com. But trust me It is a lot better than Paris is Burning because its a 2005 make. 
 This is so to say a sequel to batman the animated and it is pretty much as good as it to and for all the same reasons it has lots of action in it the storyline to it is good the voice over actors are really good such as Kevin Conroy as batman Mark Hamil as the Joker etc. The villains are really good such as The Joker Two-face Catwoman Clayface etc. So i am sure you will not be disappointed with the new adventures of batman because it is really good. So make sure that you watch it on TV or rent or buy the collectors edition because it is really good. Overall score: ********* out of ********** **** out of ***** 
 Troubled men's magazine photographer Adrien Wilde (well played with considerable intensity by Michael Callan) has horrific nightmares in which he brutally murders his models. When the lovely ladies start turning up dead for real Adrien worries that he might be the killer. Writer/director William Byron Hillman relates the engrossing story at a steady pace builds a reasonable amount of tension delivers a few gruesomely effective moments of savage misogynistic violence (one woman who has a plastic garbage bag with a rattlesnake in it placed over her head rates as the definite squirm-inducing highlight) puts a refreshing emphasis on the nicely drawn and engaging true-to-life characters further grounds everything in a plausible everyday world and tops things off with a nice smattering of tasty female nudity. The fine acting from an excellent cast helps matters a whole lot: Joanna Pettet as sunny charming love interest Mindy Jordache James Stacy as Adrien's macho double amputee brother B.J. Seymour Cassel as Adrien's concerned psychiatrist Dr. Frank Curtis Don Potter as Adrien's feisty gay assistant Louis Pamela Hensley as gutsy homicide detective Sergeant Fountain Cleavon Little as a hard-nosed police chief and Misty Rowe as sweet bubbly model Bambi. R. Michael Stringer's polished cinematography makes impressive occasional use of breathtaking panoramic aerial shots. Jack Goga's ominous rattling score likewise does the trick. Popping up in cool bit parts are Robert Tessier as a gruff bartender Sally Kirkland as a saucy hooker Kathy Shower as a fierce female wrestler B.J. grapples with in the ring and Frances Bay in one of her standard old woman roles. A solid and enjoyable picture. 
 The stories in this video are very entertaining and it definately is worth a look! The first one concerns a young couple harrassed in the woods by two rednecks with a great but unexplained twist at the end. The seond is the best of the lot and it alone makes this worth watching - A man is attacked by a dog which he fears to be rabid - He finds shelter in what appears to be a hospital but he finds out the employees there are not exactly what they appear to be...... Great twist at the end and this episode alone scores 10/10! If the others were up to par with this one this would get 10/10! The third is the weakest of the bunch - A girl meets with some guys and has wild sex! There appears to be no point to the story until the end with a good little twist but it is spoiled by the awful first part! Never the less this is a great movie that will not do you wrong at all! Well worth a rental! 
 A wrong-doer is often a man that has left something undone not always he that has done something. --Emperor Marcus Aurelius The DVD release of Watch on the Rhine could not come at a better moment. It restores to us a major Lillian Hellman play stirringly adapted to the screen by Dashiell Hammett (Hellman scholar Bernard F. Dick's audio commentary affirms his authorship). It presents a subtle performance by Bette Davis who took a subdued secondary role long after she'd become the workhorse queen at the Warner Bros. lot. Equally significantly it reminds us that World War II had a purpose. Sure you say like we needed that. We've heard Cary Grant sermonizing in Destination Tokyo (1943) about Japanese boys and their Bushido knives. We've watched jackboots stomp the living hills in The Sound of Music (1965). We've toured an England callously occupied by Germany in It Happened Here (1966). Yet truth to tell we still need the message spread. I have an 81-year-old friend who curses Franklin Roosevelt regularly. He feels that FDR connived the U.S. into a foreign fight we didn't need and thereby caused the death of his favorite cousin. He's encouraged in his demonizing of Allied leaders and the trivializing of War Two by Patrick Buchanan. The political columnist has freshly released a fat book heavy with detailed research which claims that Adolf Hitler would have posed no further menace to Poland Europe or the world if only the Third Reich had been handed the Free City of Danzig in 1939. Buchanan holds that if those selfish Poles hadn't confronted the Nazis drawing in foolishly meddling Britain and giddily altruistic France no war would have engulfed the West. He believes that without the rigors of Total War no one in Germany would have built gas chambers to provide a Final Solution to the Jewish Problem. Some commenters on this site feel that Watch sags under the weight of stale propaganda. Maybe. However neither my friend nor Pat Buchanan seem to have gotten the film's point: Some people hurt and kill to grab other people's land goods and liberty; such people dominated the Axis Powers and enough didn't appear in their vocabulary. Paul Lukas deserved the Oscar he won. He and Bette Davis put convincing passion into their portrayals of refugees who fight oppressors. They give emotional punch to the intellectual case for stepping off the sidelines for actively facing down torturers and murderers. Bernard Dick notes that Hellman didn't care for Lukas as a person since he stayed apolitical. Of course as a Hungarian he had seen first-hand Bela Kun's bloody dictatorship of the proletariat replace an outmoded empire and then topple to Admiral Horthy's right-wing tyranny. In a marvelous cameo role added to the play by Hammett Henry Daniell sardonically depicts a Wehrmacht officer of the class that disdains the brown shirts he serves. His Phili von Ramme would doubtless stand with Field Marshal Rommel in 1944 during the Plot of July 20th against Hitler. In April 1940 however he pragmatically abets the Nazi cause although he insults Herr Blecher the Butcher and scorns the Rumanian aristocrat Teck de Brancovis for trying to peddle information on an Underground leader. Teck a pauper and possible cuckold wishes cash and a visa to return to Europe where he can resume the shreds of a life that had come undone with the empire-shattering Great War and the greater world-wide economic Depression. He has no political convictions no scruples about trading a freedom fighter for his own tomorrow. Mercury Theater graduate George Coulouris lends this burnt-out case's Old World cynicism an edge of desperate menace. Lucille Watson gives winsome vitality to the grasping man's hostess a domineering old gal who knows her mind and gets her way--but who doesn't adequately appreciate her children and their achievements outside the home she controls. She and her pallid office-bound son belong to the American version of von Ramme's and de Brancovis' privileged kind. However this family hasn't seen ruin and never will. They're moneyed people who could silently advance evil simply by not opposing it. This mother and son might easily make choices which would reflect that complaisance toward National Socialism and Fascism which flourishes today in my friend and in pundit Buchanan. Watch on the Rhine has a manicured period look. Its dialogue reflects its erudite origins on the stage rather than sounding fresh from the streets. Yet Hellman and Hammett's film has gut-based power. Audiences still need to hear and heed its call to arms against grabbers relentlessly on the march. 
 I came to Nancy Drew expecting the worst...because of everyone else's bad reviews. I thought: Even though I don't read the books that doesn't look anything like the Nancy Drew I've heard of. But I was wrong. Sure it wasn't a carbon copy of the books but when you make a movie out of something you have to modify it to become big-screen entertainment. The plot was enjoyable and thrilling with a lot of actual scares and I thought that Emma Roberts was really believable in her own way of portraying this classic character. There were several funny moments and on the contrary of many statements at no point in this film does Nancy come off as a ditz. She was intelligent conservative polite and genuine. One thing this movie also did well was balance the whole thing out with a mix of comedy romance suspense and heartfelt moments. I loved this movie. What a flick what a flick! And if you are wise and decide to trust me and go see this be prepared for some SCARY as heck moments because I was like freaking out! Go see it or be a bum-bum and just let other people decide what you think of this movie for you...a mistake I almost made. I love it I wanna own this movie! I love Emma Roberts now too. She's like a mini-Bree Van De Kamp from DH. Love it love it. 
 I only know of one other movie that could possibly compete with Opening Night and that's Bergman';s Persona. Both movies are simply amazing they have a richness of ideas hard to grasp at first sight. We have a profound meditation on the relation of art and life as one actress Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands) finds herself more in touch with the character she is playing on stage than she would want to. The accidental death of one of her fans a young girl that declares her love for Myrtle and she is then hit by a car leaves a deep mark in the actress. She starts asking herself question related to her aging that starts to affect her until the only solution becomes alcohol. But that doesn't help to much and Myrtle is one step away from complete madness. The scene where she kill the imaginary (or not) spirit of the dead girl is one of the most thrilling scenes I found in a Cassavets film. The movie ends with a display of genius on behalf of the director as he films a theater scene where he himself and Gena Rowlands improvise a scene since Myrtle comes too drunk to the opening night to perform her part accurately. This scene was filmed spontaneously with a live audience the laughter is genuine the chemistry between Casavates and Rowlands absolutely amazing. If you liked Persona or are interested in a movie that offers substantial ideas alongside great entertainment this movie will suit you just fine. 
 i totally disagree.i thought that this was a great movie for kids.dawn wells from gilligans island and promise shown of a barely then known dana plato.it was disneylike and for that it can hardly be disregarded as meaningless fluff.no it wasn't scary and wasn't meant to be.i wont ruin the ending.but it was unusual the way that it was done.i mean the kids characters were great and i didn't know what to expect in the end.the basic plot also had a lot more to do with these kids than you say the fact that these kids were expert fishermen is very central to the plot especially initially.it also helps them out of a jam towards the end.it also has the plus of not being overly long.i think it clocks in at under 95 minutes 
 If you were a director that was looking to cast female victims for a slasher movie then surely it would make sense to add a couple of porn stars? It's not as if they're inexperienced in front of the camera they have no qualms with the requisite nudity and how many unattractive porn queens can you name? Christian Viel obviously recognized the potential of mixing hardcore actresses with hard-gore effects and so he cast four of adult cinema's sexiest and most notorious stars. Jenna Jameson Chasey Lain Ginger Lynn Allen and Taylor Hayes all turn up for cameos in arguably the most intriguing slasher flick to be released since Scream Reinvigorated the genre. Samhain was originally intended for a cinema release in October 2002 - thus keeping in check with the Halloween-based synopsis. Unfortunately the shoot was plagued by numerous problems which have thus prevented the feature from achieving the exposure that it deserves. Last I heard it had been signed by Film 2000 here in the UK and was penned for a late October release direct to DVD. Unfortunately that label has got a peerlessly abysmal track record with DTV slashers. Not content with polluting our shelves with Camp Blood and its follow up they were also responsible for unleashing Granny Bleed and the rancid Paranoid. Could Samhain finally be worthwhile ammunition to their contemptible catalogue cannon? Five Canadian/American students and their teacher head to Southern Ireland as part of their history course. Upon arrival they are told the legend of a cannibalistic clan that roamed the hills of Scotland and murdered locals for food. The cannibals were eventually caught and burnt at the stake but it's rumored that one of the tribe escaped and headed to the woodland of Ireland to find refuge. After the kids have settled and begun doing what all massacre-fodder does in these flicks the mandatory goody two-shoes (and definite heroine candidate) begins to be spooked by a shadow creeping around late at night. Could it be that the flesh hungry maniac is still at large in the Forest? Well what do you think?? It looks as if Samhain's production was jinxed right from the start. Almost immediately Wallmart refused to develop Jenna Jameson's nude make-up shots and Chasey Lain began acting characteristically like a drugged-out primadonna. Finally to add insult to injury the producers got cold feet just before the flick was about to hit shelves and began talking of re-editing and removing all the gore. Reports have said that they were unhappy about the copious amounts of violence and they wanted to trim scenes down so it would achieve an R rating. Veil of course disagreed seeing how his entire synopsis was boosted by its creatively graphic display. Eventually after months of arguments the director parted company with Warehouse productions and the feature was once again locked in the vaults. Despite countless disruptions Veil's slasher opus is still one of the best genre pieces to be released since the new millennium. The copy I was sent was the pre-release screener which was obviously a test press without sound effects or the complete soundtrack. But still it boasted a few credible jump-scares some superb cinematography and a couple of the goriest set pieces that I've seen for some time. One guy is disemboweled via his rectum before being strangled with his own intestine Jenna Jameson is stripped naked and gutted in unflinching close up and Chasey Lain ends up 'spilling her guts' after an unfortunate rescue attempt from her boyfriend (Richard Grieco). Even though the murders are uncommonly gruesome Samhain never feels mean spirited which is basically due to the characters being thinly portrayed as basic slasher clich¨¦s. In all honesty the script was perhaps the movies biggest downfall because the dialogue was not so much inspired by Wes Craven's Scream movies as it was flagrantly cut and pasted from them. Certainly the inclusion of the mouth-watering Jenna Jameson was a great move by the producers. Her fans will be excited to know that she does whip off her top (as expected) and so does Chasey Lain and Taylor Hayes. But Samhain is no soft porn movie and it benefits from sticking to the structure that it set out to produce. It's worth noting that the aforementioned XXX stars almost out-perform the supposed 'actors' of the feature which isn't much of a complement. Ginger Lynn was at least notable (if you ignore the shameful 'Oirish accent) and her battle with the hulking killer was superbly performed and choreographed by Alan Chou. Taylor and Jenna delivered expectedly poor dramatics which could have been caused by the numerous problems on-set. Veil's direction of the cinematography was excellently constructed and he provides some much-needed injections of suspense. Exciting and crisp photography is mixed with a good flair for storytelling and the net result is a slasher extravaganza to satisfy even the most critical gore hounds. It will be interesting to see what kind of final cut is released of Samhain. Rumor has it that a second director was drafted in to shoot a different ending and I'm curious as to how much of the explicit gore will remain intact for worldwide distribution. If the end result is only half as good as the rough print that I watched then it's still better than nearly all of the genre pieces that have been unleashed over the past ten years. This one is certainly worth checking out? 
 When I was chairman of our college's coffeehouse one of our jobs was to review groups and films for student activities. One of the best things to come along in 1972 was Groove Tube. The original premise was that it was being shown off-off Broadway in theaters where television monitors were being placed throughout the audience so everyone had a great seat. The premise was that the skits would change on a regular basis-ala Saturday Night Live keeping the thing fresh. They decided on making it into a film for general distribution. I believe the developers said it was the first time Chevy Chase was on film. Watching him run naked though the woods was a howl. Like many of the reviews before mine it WAS Saturday Night Live before such a thing existed. I highly recommend this vid. I've told my 13 year old son about Koko the clown- He can't wait to get a copy! 
 Having no knowledge of this film prior to seeing it on Rialto Channel I found it to be a pleasant poignant and enriching film. The casting was excellent. I loved all the characters they were a little exaggerated in places (but this IS a film). The way it looked and the enjoyably giddy ride the main character took until it turned badly as real life can and does. Yes I thought Andy MacDowell was great. I was particularly interested to watch this film once it began because people so often joke about her acting abilities (I find this quite wierd because she's always a solid actress in my opinion). I loved the bit at the end where Andy's character said sometimes I feel he was never here etc. it was so completely how it really is in a situation like that (which I can personally identify with) then there was that gorgeous classical piece Nocturne I think by Chopin which was a beautiful way to end (bar the light comedy at the end which was probably unnecessary). I say well done to the film makers - I have seen 1 000s of worse films! 
 For anyone who wishes to get an impression of the Soviet view of modern Russian history this monumental film is a treasure. The story starts at the turn of the century (1900) in the yellowish sepia colours of old photographs which improves to black and white during the middle of the century and to full colour when the story approaches modern times (i.e. the 1960s). The story focuses on a boy in a remote Siberian village who is marked by the arrival and arrest of an anarchist during the czarist era. He later joins the Bolsheviks after the revolution and brings soviet communism to his village. His son by the local beauty fights the Germans during the Second World War. When he returns to the village the oil industry takes off and we are treated to some Soviet economic idealism. This film is long and slow but utterly logic and very well made. It can be seen in three parts. 
 An ultra-nervous old man Mr. Goodrich terrorized by the news that a gang is stalking the city and prominent citizens are disappearing really panics when someone throws a rock through his window with a message tied to it saying You will be next! He calls the detective agency wondering where are the guys he asked for earlier. Of course it's the Stooges who couldn't respond because had come into the office robbed them and tied them up. Some detectives! The moment poor Mr. Goodrich hangs up the phone and says I feel safer already a monster-type goon named Nico appears out of a secret panel in the room and chokes him unconscious. We next find out that his trusted employees are anything but that. Now these crooks have to deal with the detectives that are coming by the house for Mr. Goodrich. Some of the gags like Moe and Larry's wrinkles are getting a bit old but some of them will provoke laughs if I see them 100 times. I always laugh at Shemp trying to be a flirt as he does here with Mr. Goodrich's niece in a classic routine with a long accordion-like camera lens. The act he puts on when he's poisoned is always funny too. Shemp was so good that I didn't mind he was taking the great Curly's place. Larry Moe Curly/Shemp were always great in the chase scenes in which monsters or crooks or both are chasing them around a house. That's the last six minutes in here. At times such as this film  
 I couldn't have been more thrilled; Just eight years old back in 1983 I was going to see a Star Wars movie at the theater! The best day of my life was about to happen. To that time my only Star Wars experience had been a few HBO showings of Star Wars. I hadn't even seen The Empire Strikes Back yet. And boy did that day deliver for my less critical eyes. Jabba. Big Rebel spaceships. The Emporer. A green-bladed lightsaber!! Wow! Since that magical day I must have watched this movie hundreds of times. I can't even form an accurate estimate at this point. With those multiple viewings I have of course observed that this movie - the REAL Episode III - does have its flaws. Of course in the context of a Star Wars movie those flaws are more like quirks . Millions had had their magical day in 1977 and 1980. In May of 1983 I had mine. And this was my Star Wars movie. 
 Making a book into a movie by following the story page-by-page is NEVER a good idea. When people read the book they automatically start making their own mental movie of who the characters look like the places they exist in how the situations progress. And everybody's mind's-eye opus is different which is why when the 'REAL' movie finally comes out you're always going to have a ticked-off segment of the movie-going audience who are disappointed that it just doesn't measure up. All a screenwriter and a director can hope to accomplish is whatever their own vision of the movie is and hope that it comes as close as possible to what their audience is expecting to see. There is no better case for this situation than the movies based on the novels of Stephen King. When filmmakers capture at least the essence of his stories the results can be breathtaking and truly terrifying (CARRIE 'SALEM'S LOT THE DEAD ZONE) or they can be what fans consider to be a gawd-awful mess (Kubrick's version of THE SHINING; the miniseries for IT and THE TOMMYKNOCKERS). Although it's not even close to being the perfect King adaptation PET SEMATARY has so many moments of just skin-and-bone-deep unease that seemed to have bled onto the screen directly from the book that you can pretty much forgive its shortcomings. For that we have music video-turned-film director Mary Lambert to thank (she also directed SIESTA not exactly a horror movie but another freaky-as-hell must-see you should put on your list) working from a screenplay by the 'Man-ster' Himself and probably one of his better ones. Since the majority of you know the story I won't put you to sleep with too many of the details. Dr. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) has moved his family out to the perfect house in the country. Well almost perfect except for two nasty little details: the dangerously busy stretch of interstate highway out in front and the large pet cemetery in the woods out back. Since Louis is a veterinarian and has a young toddler for a son...well even if you haven't read the book do the frickin' math. It IS a King story after all so no mystery where this is headed. It's not so much the destination that counts here but the spooky stops along the way. Certain scenes that are so familiar from the book are brought to shivery scream-inducing life here: Rachel Creed's (STAR TREK'S Denise Crosby) horrific memory of her terminally ill crippled sister; Louis's encounters with the mortally injured jogger Victor Pascow (Brad Greenquist) both before and after his death; the trip into the other cemetery beyond the pet cemetery. And that third act...if it doesn't give you a few nightmares maybe you should check your pulse. Good performances by all here especially the late Fred Gwynne as the well-intentioned neighbor Jud Crandall who gets the best line in the story that sums it all up: Sometimes dead is better. About the only problem with the movie version is the casting of Louis's son Gage (Miko Hughes). Knowing that it would be damn near impossible to get the kind of performance needed from a kid that age to seal the deal on this Lambert and crew still did the best they could and unfortunately Hughes at the time was just too damn CUTE to sell his intended role as an evil demon-possessed zombie. This takes you out of the movie whenever he shows up though the scenes where he's featured are still masterfully staged (especially Gwynne's death scene.) Other than that everything else is still about as good as it gets. CARRIE still holds the title for best King adaptation as far as I'm concerned; but SEMATARY is right up there in the Top Five. Still will anything adapted for the screen based on a King book be as terrifying as reading the story? Not BLOODY likely...for now. 
 Not so many people like the movies of Bertrand blier simply because they don't understand them. Simply because they are different kinds of people. If you have not been living under a deep desperation intertwined with great personal hope it may be hard for you to enjoy the humor blier shown here. And also the film of blier cannot be classified easily as black-comedy or cult etc. like those of pulp fiction etc. Because there is this delicacy which the audience of north-america frequently fail to appreciate. When I looked at these two `hooligans' dining with Jeanne moreau in the seaside restaurant I felt they were more gentil than any gentleman can have been. The urge to make love wildly like these is the normal reaction we feel under the unbearable pressure of meaningless being-symbolized by the camion suddenly emerges at the Carrefour. SO les valseuses is much better a name than going places. To dance a valse you need to be elegant but going places you don't. 
 This is an OK adaptation but not as good as the TV version. The actors are generally alright but I found Jeremy Northam rather wet as Mr Knightley particularly compared to Mark Strong in the TV version. Gwyneth Paltrow is OK and her English accent is pretty good but again I preferred Kate Beckinsale's Emma. There are excellent support performances from Toni Collette Juliet Stephenson and Sophy Thompson. The script is often played too much for laughs the book is a comedy but there are too many set-piece gags here and also the Frank Churchill subplot is almost completely absent. My biggest criticism is the scenery. It is far too lush. England has never been like this. It looks like a chocolate box. Only Americans would make it like this. Despite these criticisms I enjoyed this film but would recommend the TV adaptation more. 
 I've seen this movie and I must say I'm very impressed. There are not much movies I like but I do like this one. You should see this movie by yourself and comment it because this is one of my most favorite movie. I fancy to see this again. Action fused with a fantastic story. Very impressing. I like Modesty's character. Actually she's very mystic and mysterious (I DO like that^^). The bad boy is pretty too. Well actually this whole movie is rare in 'movieworld'. I considered about the vote of this movie I thought this is should be a very popular movie. I guess wrong. It was ME who was very impressed about this movie and I hope I'm not the only one who takes only the cost to watch this one. See and vote. 
 When Tsui Hark experiments nothing and no one can withstand him. Legend of Zu is possibly 6Hours condensed into 1h40. One does not understand all but like at 2001 A Space Odyssey you also don't have to but one feels the power of the film to every second every picture. An extraordinary vision of the future of the 7th art and the one of the most pioneering astounding rejoicing in the recent years. VITAL severe MASTERPIECE! It's absolutely perfect as it is.

 This film is one of the finest American B-movies of the 90s. If you're looking for a serious film look elsewhere. However if you're looking for some action a lot of laughs and a tongue in cheek variation on cops fighting gangsters this is well worth watching. Everyone chews the scenery a bit but that's really what the film is all about and everyone is quite funny. Donald Sutherland and John Lithgow have great chemistry and need to do another film together. 
 The Last Big Thing is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically whips pop culture to the point of humorous self-desctruction. The characters are so interesting and fun to laugh at/sympathize with. Which brings me to an introduction to the characters I liked best... Simon Geist is a man in his late 30s/early 40s who creates a pop-culture driven editorial magazine called The Next Big Thing . Thing is this magazine doesnt really exist and it is only an excuse for Simon to get close to actors by interviewing them only to bitch-slap them silly insulting their way of buying into pop culture. His live-in female friend Darla is also writing a magazine (which is real) which mainly has to do with her and Simon as well as her and her father. Darla is a genuinely loveable (or loathable) character depending on how you view her muted neurotic behavior. Magda is a prostitute the character i liked the best. Brent is a flat character with not much to him as is Tedra the music-video queen for a bunch of B-rated rock bands. Still these characters weave a very interesting web together. And this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it. Its a wonderful film and I suggest you see it if you're in the indie/art house crowd. Mark my words! 
 If it's action and adventure you want in a movie then you'd be best advised to look elsewhere. On the other hand if it's a lazy day and you want a good movie to go along with that mood check out The Straight Story. Richard Farnsworth puts on a compelling performance as the gentle and gentlemanly Alvin Straight in this true story of Alvin's journey on a riding mower across three states to see his estranged brother who has had a stroke. Farnsworth is perfect in this role as he travels his long and winding road making friends of strangers and doling out lots of grandfatherly type advice about family along the way. The story moves along as slowly as the riding mower but somehow manages to keep the viewer watching waiting for the next life lesson Alvin's going to offer. Stretch out on the couch relax and enjoy. It's the only way to watch this very good movie which rates a 7/10 in my book. 
 This is a classic action flick from the '80s featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger in one of his most memorable roles. Set in a futuristic police state where the government controls everything including the television networks. One of their most popular TV shows is The Running Man where convicted felons are hunted down and killed for the entertainment of millions. It's set up like a game show where the audience votes for their favorite stalkers trained killers who hunt down and kill the show's unlucky contestants . Audience members also win prizes for correctly predicting who will be killed by whom. And the host is played by none other than Family Feud's Richard Dawson who's game show experience makes him well suited for this role. When Ben Richards (Arnold) is falsely accused of mass murder he is forced to play this sadistic game. This movie is chock full of classic Arnold one-liners such as his famous I'll be back right before he enters the arena. And he taunts a stalker armed with a flamethrower with How about a light? I could go on and on but I don't want to spoil the movie. It's funny stuff! Whether it was intended or not this movie serves as a great parody of today's Reality TV craze. Already there are numerous programs that show people enduring pain and humiliation for the entertainment of viewers and even court cases are televised for their entertainment value . Running Man demonstrates what would happen if reality TV hit rock bottom and it is a scary picture. One can only hope that the networks have the common sense not to let it go that far. Overall this is a fun film & I highly recommend it. 9 out of 10! 
 I first heard of this movie after purchasing the 1976 flick Snuff . I was told that Devil's Experiment was much better so naturally I went ahead and ordered the Guinea Pig box set. I was really interested to hear that Charlie Sheen had come out trying to ban either this movie or the second one so my interest was peaked. Devil's Experiment is a short film with no story no character development. Just 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes. They torture her in various ways like beating her spinning her in circles over and over again then forcing her to drink alcohol forcing her to listen to hi-pitched noise for 24 hours smash her hand with a mallet burning and putting maggots on the burns throwing guts at her and ultimately shoving a sharp needle through her eye. I must say that a lot of this movie was fake like the beating scenes. But then some of it was actually well done as far as grossing you out. The scenes in which the woman is being spun around in circles was making me dizzy watching it. Or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for 24 hours is painful to think about. The worst is the eye scene. I didn't shutter when watching it but simply thought Damn that looks pretty good for such a low budget movie . I did enjoy the flick but I don't know if I can really recommend this unless you have seen most of what the horror genre has to offer. 7/10 
 Highly memorable intelligent and suspenseful movie from one of French movies' true geniuses the formidably able Henri Verneuil. The plot is an exact parallel of the JFK assassination and takes place in a non-descript fictional country. The film visually as well as plot-wise is razor-sharp. Shot with meticulous precision it follows Henry Volnay the Procuror who takes on himself to unravel the coup. In many ways it's a very disturbing movie not the least for the cold and analytical precision of its comment on a so-called modern state's inner workings. The atmosphere and characters are all utterly believable and Verneuil left nothing to chance in its tight plotting. On another level this relatively little-known movie just had a 15 years head-start on Oliver Stone who was acclaimed for the JFK movie a inferior film in many areas the least of which not being credibility... It's a masterpiece any cinema lover should see it preferably in its original French version with subs. 
 This was surprisingly intelligent for a TV movie and quite true to my own experience of bulimia. It was actually well-researched and I can only assume it was written by someone who's gone through a similar experience because it had all the little details. The characters were quite well-drawn and the performances by Mare Winningham and Alison Lohman were great. I think what I like most was that they made them specific and smart and there was no dumbing down of the reasons for Beth's bulimia (it wasn't some diet gone out of control caused by the pressures placed on girls by the media pressures we're not actually going to address... ). Her mother wasn't completely clueless - too often on television they'll take an issue that EVERYONE has some awareness of and try to tell us that their protagonists are the last remaining people on earth who don't ( Diabetes? What's that? Oh my world is all askew doctor please explain it all to me as if I'm a small child etc). It was brilliant that her mother was a psychologist and even she didn't see the signs. And the scenes where Beth was throwing up weren't OVERLY melodramatic and sensationalist and concentrated more on bulimics' need for secrecy and their out-of-controlness. The scene where Beth tells her mother she's bulimic would've made me cry if there hadn't been other people in the room. Okay so I liked those bits. What didn't work for me so well was the ending which headed back to the TV movie territory we know and don't particularly love but I guess they had to wrap it up. You too can cure your child's eating disorder if you have lots and lots of money and live in America... And can I just say again that I really like Mare Winningham. She's great. 
 What a delightful film... Accompanied by Oscar-winning Composer RACHEL PORTMAN's lush emotional and dreamy music this film remains a pure delight worthy of viewing more than once a year. Incredible casting... Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect for the role of Emma. Toni Collette was great as Harriett Smith. The character who stole the film was MISS BATES!!! She was mesmerizing to watch one finds oneself on the edge of ones' seat just hanging on her every word and laughing hysterically WITH her. One of the most endearing characters I have come across in ages. From one of the opening scenes when she is thanking Mr. Woodhouse for sending that lovely quarter-hind of pork... PORK MOTHER!!! she shouts into her daffy and clearly hearing impaired Mother Mrs. Bates (played by Emma Thompson's mother Phyllida Law) who looks forlorn and lost. The comical ways that Emma would avoid the grating Miss Bates builds itself up for one truly gut-wrenching scene at the picnic when Emma insults Miss Bates who takes her cruel dig to her heart. We then see poor Miss Bates stammering and on the verge of tears and just so crushed one can not help but feel one's heart ripped out to her on her behalf. It is a classic scene one to be rewound and played over & over... The ending is right up there with Sense & Sensibility and provides one of life's greatest lessons about how one should marry one's best friend... I hope that this film delights you all as much as it has myself. I ADORED it! 
 I thought this movie was very well put together. The voice-overs were also great. I liked how they all overcame their conflicts and reached their goals. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It was definitely worth the time and money to watch it. Atlantis has some comic scenes that made me laugh. Other scenes made me sad. And others made me glad. It is a movie any age can enjoy. From the moment Milo is the crazy profesor or until he gathers the crew up for the fantastic voyage under the sea. After I watched the movie I read the book. It was good as well but the movie puts better pictures in your mind. It is just like the book. But go ahead and watch this movie! 
 Man's Castle is a wonderful example of a Pre-Code film. It involves realistic events with truly enjoyable and imperfect characters. Spencer Tracy plays Bill a free soul without a dime in his pocket. He makes a living doing odd jobs and traveling to a new city when he gets bored of his surroundings. One night he meets Trina a beauty by any standards who is cold and alone. She has refused to resort to prostitution so she has not eaten for several days but the two take very well to each other and form a relationship. His free spirit tempts him to leave her so life is rocky but there is a true spark between the two even if they live in a shack by the river. Tracy is one of the great actors of the silver screen. His characters are amazing and relatable. We can see his thoughts on his face making him easy to identify with even if we believe he is behaving badly. Young is great in pre-code films. Her character is very sweet but far from perfect making her all the more likable. Pre-code elements include skinny dipping pregnancy before marriage and crime. 
 This movie is banned in just about every foreign country I can think of. The Japanese people (?) who star in this must have been really desperate for a job or we're just friends. Here's the scoop: Three thugs torture the hell out of a helpless woman they use all kinds of things to eventually kill her they burn her kick her spin here around in a chair (over 200 times!) they use sound torture (by forcing her to listen to a static sound for over 20 hours! It don't sound that bad at all but it CAN make you go nuts). They throw guts (probably from an animal) at her while shes knocked out and she freaks when she wakes up. And who can forget the grande finale the GREATEST EYEBALL TORTURE I HAVE EVER SEEN! If you have not heard of these films and watch one without knowing that it is a simulated snuff film you will think it is! (just ask Charlie Sheen) This is guaranteed to freak people out and make some sick! Like I said pure underground. Check it out if you are a fan of underground horror or foreign gore. If your not I highly recommend you read-up on the series before watching! From the gore shock and creativity aspect it gets a 10 but from the storyline and all that stuff it is a 1. An underground classic... My final rating is a 8/10 
 I originally saw this film years ago during Cinemax Friday after dark series(back when the cable box was built like a keyboard) and it intrigued me. Even though there is a pointless aspect to the film it is well acted.The performances of Depardieu & Dewaere are very enjoyable.They have a good chemistry together & Miou-Miou makes a pink fur look breathtaking.A movie like this probably wouldn't be made in these politically correct times(at least not in the US) since it seems to sensationalize things like violence robbery & casual sex. This movie proves that with a talented cast & also talented directing a good movie is a good movie no matter the subject.It saddened me to find out Patrick Dewaere committed suicide & in the near future I ll will check him out with Depardieu & Miou-Miou in Get Out Your Hankerchief. 
 This early film has its flaws-- a predictable plot and some overlong scenes of dubious relevance-- but it already clearly demonstrates Hitchcock's mastery of editing and the use of powerful images. It's also among the most expressionist of his films stylistically; note for examples the weird distortions he uses during the party sequence and the frequent echoes of both title and plot in the imagery. Its core though remains the final match which is still among the more exciting examples of cinematic boxing. Even though you know that the hero has to win it becomes quite believable that he will lose and the movement of his wife from the champion's corner to his motivating the final plot pay-off is very well entwined with the progress of the match. The inserts of the stopwatch do exactly what they should; you can almost hear the ticking (even though this is a silent film the visuals often have a surprisingly auditory feel to them). The pacing becomes astonishingly rapid and the viewer gets sucked into the excitement and brutality of both the match and the sexual jealousy which underlies it. The only DVD release with which I am familiar is that of Laserlight a public domain company. As with each Hitchcock silent they've released they've attached various musical selections mostly orchestral to the action. The sound editing is frequently sloppy and the sound quality varies widely but some genuine care seems to have gone into most of the actual choices and the music accompanying the final match works extremely well; it is unlikely that this sequence will ever be better accompanied than it is here. This is a much more impressive film than its present obscurity would suggest. It deserves an honorable place in both the Hitchcock canon and the slender list of worthwhile boxing films. 
 I got to see the movie On Thin Ice on the television in India.. I must say the movie was really well done and really sent a chill down my spine.. the basic story makes me ponder what makes certain addicts decide to move on where as others still remain addicted... however I felt that Diane Keaton was at her best... the scene where she has cravings and begins rummaging her home for cocaine... was the best... the two boys are good and Lynda Boyd also showed what a good actress she is....The script is well done as is the cinematography and direction.. and casting A must must watch movie..... for everyone 
 G¨¦d¨¦on and Jules Naudet wanted to film a documentary about rookie New York City firefighters. What they got was the only film footage inside the World Trade Center on September 11. Having worked with James Hanlon's ladder company before Jules went with the captain to inspect and repair a gas leak while G¨¦d¨¦on stayed at the firehouse in case anything interesting happened. An airplane flying low over the City distracted Jules and he pointed the camera up seconds before the plane crashed into Tower One. Jules asked the captain to follow him into the Towers. The first thing he saw was two people on fire something he refused to film. He stayed on site for the next several hours filming reactions of the firefighters and others who were there. The brothers Naudet took great care in not making the movie too violent grizzly and gory. But the language from the firefighters is a little coarse and CBS showed a lot of balls airing it uncensored. The brothers Naudet mixed footage they filmed with one-on-one interviews so the firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions during particular moments of the crisis. Unlike a feature film of similar title most of the money from DVD sales go to 9/11-related charities. Very well made emotional moving and completely devoid of political propaganda is the best documentary of the sort to date. 
 This 1947 film stars and was directed and written by Orson Welles (with a funky Irish accent) and also stars the gorgeous Rita Hayworth with less appealing short blonde hair. So I've hung out with Orson before in Touch of Evil and Citizen Kane and the Third Man etc. but this was my first Rita Hayworth interaction. Our first meeting went well she does a superb job playing the frightened/cagey Elsa married to a crippled millionaire lawyer. Mike (Welles) and Elsa fall for each other. He wants to run away with her she doesn't know if she can live without the things money can buy. Elsa her husband and his partner bicker and bite just like the sharks Mike describes attacking each other and his foretelling proves just too true. Several twists and turns follow in this murder mystery as we come to the climax in the fun house. (Think the ending shootout in The Man with the Golden Gun which borrowed heavily from this scene). I wasn't sure who the murderer was until the end. This movie is like shrimp in garlic and lemon. The dish centers on the sea it is subtle sour and pungent all to great effect. These might not be the best fresh shrimp but good quality frozen shrimp from Costco. The flavorful sauce adds to the naturalness of the pink shrimp as you fill up on a healthy but filling alternative to more mundane common fare. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies 
 With lots of sunshine gauzy light and shadow filtering through windows and into rooms tracking shots moving through crowds with hand-held camera quick-paced editing and extreme close-ups here and there the photography is the thing in this interesting artistically done film. The plot of this film starts out as a bit of fluff about a beauty contest. The film begins on a warm Sunday at the local swimming pool where we meet the lovely Lucienne aka Lulu (played by Louise Brooks) - a bit of a show-off in front of the gawking men by poolside she soon decides to enter herself to represent France in the Miss Europe beauty contest much to the chagrin of her very jealous stick-in-the-mud fianc¨¦ (a pretty annoying fellow really). Strutting down the runway the ten contestants display themselves in swimsuits while the winner is chosen as the contestant who receives the longest applause (I was wondering couldn't the girls just walk slower to prolong their length of time - and thus applause - on the catwalk?!). Lulu is soon being chased by a Prince and a Maharaja but her hot-headed beau doesn't like the attentions paid to her by other men or her adoring public for that matter (I guess he just wants her in his house cooking his meals and staying out of sight eh?!). Louise Brooks is beautiful and charming her presence helps enhance this film but it's really the way it is photographed that held my interest the most. A bit distracting is the odd dubbed sound which is a bit off. The print on this version looked very clear and full of nice contrast though. Watching this I just tried to overlook the sound problems and watch the film visually and I found the movie to be excellent well worth seeing. 
 Not many movies were made about the Lighter-Than-Air (LTA) aspect of aviation but this is one of them and it's damn good. Just a fun film to watch. Most of the movie takes place at the Navy blimp operations at NAS Lakehurst (with NAS Tustin playing the role). Wallace Beery plays a likable but Munchausen-like Senior Chief Ned Trumpet an enlisted pilot whose tall tales have gotten so frequent nobody really believes him. Half the fun is near the end of the movie when events start proving that most of his more outlandish tales are actually true. Set during WWII the main plot centers around bachelor Trumpet wooing a local widow only to end up having a father-son relationship with the widow's crippled son Jess. Told he would never walk without crutches by doctors Chief Trumpet pulls some strings and a Navy flight surgeon helps in restoring the lad's crippled leg. Jess goes on to join the Navy to become a flight officer flying blimps back at Lakehurst and facing a whole new set of challenges. A very well-done movie albeit not without some corny Hollywood dialogue slipping past the technical advisers and Beery's apparent inability to march in step. Otherwise this movie gets good grades for technical accuracy and gives a rare look into the Navy's LTA operations. The Cash Register Scene an exchange between Trumpet and Jess's future love interest Cathy is an absolute hoot. 
 Meek tiny almost insignificant. Polanski finds the invisibility of his characters and makes something enormous out of it. In front and behind the camera he creates one of the most uncomfortable masterpieces I had the pleasure to see and see and see again. It never let's me down. People even people who know me pretty well thought/think there was/is something wrong with me based on my attraction or I should say devotion for Le Locataire They may be right I don't know but there is something irresistibly enthralling within Polanski's darkness and I haven't even mentioned the humor. The mystery surrounding the apartment and the previous tenant the mystery that takes over him and naturally us me. That building populated by great old Academy Award winners: Melvyn Douglas Shelley Winters Jo Van Fleet Lila Kedrova. For anyone who loves movies this is compulsory viewing. One two three many many viewings. 
 The makers have chosen the best people for the job and set the scene wonderfully. Every interior is full of detail that tells you all about the people who live in it. Whether the period is the 20s (the first story) the present (ie 1950) for the middle story or the 1910s (the last) costumes and settings are lovingly observed and created. I love the fussy costumes of the two old ladies in the sanatorium - exquisite lace overlaid by the finest Shetland shawls. Roland Culver as Ashenden is very appealing but never mind the soppy young lovers it's Raymond Huntley as the man who resents his wife's health and independence who harrows our emotions. He usually played comical pompous types but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive. The China Seas (great 30s film starring Gable and Harlow) stole the plot from the Mr Know All episode (and also nicked a story by Kipling). I wish we saw more of Naunton Wayne as the jealous husband - though he has a good moment looking melancholy in a Mexican hat. I love that posh bird who plays his wife too. 
 That 70s Show is the best TV show ever period. It's up there with the Andy Griffen Show Saturday Night Live and The Simpsons in my book. That 70s Show continued on for 8 seasons all of which focus around a group of teenagers/young adults dealing with relationships separating from their parents and their overall futures. The two main characters Eric and Donna are two teenagers living next door to each other. They have been living next door to each other for most of their lives and just begin to feel more feelings for each other at the beginning of the first season. A large amount of the show revolves around how their relationship is working. Two other characters Red and Kitty are Eric's parents. Red was in the service so he really pushes Eric around. Kitty is just the opposite. Even though she drinks heavily she treats Eric and his friends with a lot of care. Bob their neighbor is obviously Donna's Dad. Bob giggles around with several different women throughout the coarse of the show's story. Bob also annoys Red to his full extent. The remaining character Hyde Kelso Fez and Jackie are Eric's friends. They also play a major role in the show's story. Well the First Season is great. This is when the characters are beginning to feel new things for each other. The First Season is original funny and enjoyable. The Second Season is good although it isn't as good as the first. It is a basic continuation of the First. Eric and Donna are together and everything is working out great. The Third Season is my favorite. It went back and captured the First Season feel and humor. I also think that the character chemistry improved a bunch making the show all that more fun to watch. The Fourth Season isn't near as good. Eric and Donna Arne't together in this one making the show slightly less pleasurable. It is still funny although I didn't enjoy it as much as the previous seasons. The Fifth Season is the last season I enjoyed all the way through. It is the gang's Senior Year so that really helps with the story. The Fifth Season also had the best ending out of all the seasons. The Sixth Season is good for the most part. It is extremely funny although it doesn't capture the feel that the other seasons did. The gang is out of High School so I believe that it didn't hit the teen feel that the previous seasons did. I also didn't like the last three or four episodes considering that they had a major drama feel to them. The Seventh Season captures the same feel that the 5th season had in a way although it didn't do it all the way. I enjoyed the Seventh Season as I did all the others and the ending is great. The Last Season flat out sucked. Eric wasn't in it which ruined it. Kelso wasn't in it for the most part either which didn't help. I hated the Eighth Season up until the last episode. I thought that the last episode was really good and a fitting ending to the series. So overall if you enjoy comedy give That 70s Show a try. They stopped making new episodes but it is still on TV a bunch. I also recommend buying Seasons 1-7. It is up to you if you want to buy Season 8. 
 When I saw the Dentist I thought it was very cool. But this movie is not for everyone especially people who do not like gory scenes as the Dentist has lots of gory scenes. That's why it has it's R18 rating. It's about a beverly hills dentist Dr Alan Feinstone who finds his wife Brooke cheating on him with the poolman. It's best to go to your dentist before you watch this. But if you don't like going to the dentist already then it's best not to watch this as you may be put off going for life. the Dentist has the best bloody revenge in it that I've ever seen. Who has ever seen a movie that has a dentist (Spoiler) pull out all his cheating wife's teeth and cut out her tongue with no anesthetic? Overall awesome flick but not for everyone. 
 My watch came a little too late but am glad i watched both this and the sequel together...which makes me compliment the makers of this flick for giving such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of romanticism... and very marginally separating it from the idea of relationships! As a lot has been written about the movie already it would just be appropriate to highlight few portions of the movie which i personally loved. I think the point where Jesse and Celine make phony phone calls to their respective friends was a very shrewd way of telling each other what they had meant to each other through a journey not even extending 24 hrs... the curiosity of two people who both think the other has made an infallible impact on the other has been very smartly dealt with... On the plot front making a romantic story work on pure conversation is not an easy job to accomplish.. I believe in romantic flicks of such flavor the characters are not clearly designed even in the writer's and director's mind. What the actors bring out is what becomes of them .. right or wrong even the idea bearers would find it difficult to justify... to become the character the life the actor gives has to go beyond instructions and the story...here both the actors do just the RIGHT job! Kudos..!!!and Before sunset is another feather which makes this one even more beautiful! 
 Perhaps one of the most important and enjoyable Greek films i've seen in the last ten years..Excellent performances(especially yiannis zouganelis is great) well-written script and effective direction from a very special for the Greek very average standards auteur. A film obviously influenced by Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs that could be a masterpiece if it avoided some evident and exaggerative situations and symbolizations in the end. Nevertheless this is a movie which deserves our attention and belongs to that rare category of Greek movies which should be watched outside Greece. It's a shame that in Greece didn't work commercially in addition with other fake and cursory big productions like Politiki Kouzina.. 
 This movie pleasantly surprised me. It has a touching slightly off-center approach that never loses your attention. This is a movie I never heard about but if you want a sleeper this is it. Great writing production and acting. I highly recommend it for audiences who want something thoughtful. Nick Nolte Sheryl Lee and Alan Arkin are marvelous. Why wasn't more made of this movie? 
 This is a film that can make you want to see it again. I especially liked the way it ended. I did not see the end coming but when Laws was not blown away the first time one suspects he will be back again. The story is gripping and could have been more psychological but I understand the story needed to capture the viewer and the action was necessary for that. Hard to believe Michael Jr. could be so apparently unmoved as his younger brother and mother as blown away. But I can appreciate the scene play couldn't really take our attention there because it had a greater story to tell. Some have complained about Hanks as a gangster. I believe that isn't justified. If his character had been any harder he would not have cared if his son pulled a trigger or not. Eight Stars for this one. Although it was released in 2002 I just saw it for the first time yesterday on DVD. 
 Lots of reviews on this page mention that this movie is a little dark for kids. That depends on the kid. This isn't a movie for a 2-6 year old; it's more geared toward the 8 years and older crowd. I saw this movie when I was 10 I absolutely loved it. At the time most animated movies were a little too childish for my tastes. This movie deals with more serious issues and therefore has a little more emotional impact. In this movie characters can DIE and be sent to HELL! This gives a little more emotional weight to the scenes where characters are risking their lives. The good guys aren't always perfectly sweet and nice (like other cartoons). They have real motivations like revenge and greed but also compassion and friendship; shows that things aren't always black and white. Excellent Movie 
 Can I be as simple and primitive in my evaluations as to simply say I liked it ? It's reasonably funny by bits it got great stars and it's gorgeous to look at. The songs (there are about two which are then repeated) are forgettable but they get a healthy ironic treatment (such as the terribly handsome Mr Fairbanks exploding into frenzied Wagnerian version of the tender ballad Miss Grable has just rendered); there isn't much dancing with all the 1861 crinolines draped around Miss Grable and the comedy might be a bit heavy handed but the result still is very uplifting. The photography (including real outdoor shots which are a thrill) is amazing playing around with different shades of lush heavy gold. Miss Grable is a bit past her prime and on the plumpish side but still fresh and comfortable in this continental olde worlde comedy. It's pretty much along the line of Down to Earth with Rita Hayworth and that one tends to be rather disliked by many. So I suppose several people would deem That Lady in Ermine to be outdated and stuffy. But it's a fairy tale and these tend to move along at a certain paste anyhow. My suggestion is - just enjoy the artwork the costumes the witty script and everything else this film has to offer and stop complaining. The film has been released on DVD in Germany with both German and English soundtrack. 
 This movie is the first of Miikes triad society trilogy and the trilogy kicks of to a great start. The movies in the trilogy are only connected thematically and these themes are actually apparent in all his films if you look close enough. Shinjuku Triad Society is about a cop trying to prevent his kid brother from getting too involved with a rather extreme gang of outsiders struggling their way to the top of Tokyos yakuza. The kid brother is a lawyer and the triad gang is becoming increasingly in need of one as the movie progresses. The movie takes place in a very harsh environment and is therefore pretty violent and tough. Miike has done worse but since this is a serious movie it hits you very hard. As usual there is also a lot of perverted sex mostly homosexual in this one. The movie is in many ways a typical gangster movie but with a great drive and true grittiness. If you've only seen Miikes far-out movies (Ichi the killer Fudoh etc.) this is worth checking out since it is sort of a compromise between his aggressive over-the-top style displayed in those movies and his more serious side as seen in the other films of the trilogy. And as always with Miike there are at least two scenes in this that you'll NEVER forget (see it and figure out which ones for yourself). 8/10 
 Man about the house is a true situation comedy in every sense of the word. The comedy concerns a character called Robin Tripp (played by the great Richard O' Sullivan) who finds himself after a wild party ending up at the home of two ladies called Jo and Chrissy. Ironically the party was held to say goodbye to their old flatmate. The obvious ends up happening as he moves in. Man about the house was a pre-cursor to Cooke and Mortimer's spin off show George and Mildred which featured the 2 characters who were landlords to Jo Chrissy and Robin. These two characters would actually turn out to be the linchpins of man about the house with Mildred (the late and much missed Yootha Joyce) in particular getting some of the best lines of the series. A semi-regular character was Larry (Doug Fisher) a useless person who was always on the scrounge and only ever came round when he wanted to borrow something (and never to return it). The American's did a version called three's company but it doesn't stand a chance when compared to this far funnier original. Thames took a risk in producing a comedy about a man sharing a flat with 2 women at a very conservative time but they should worry as the ratings at the time suggest that around 20 million people just wanted to watch a good old fashioned bit of comedy with inspired casting and a sharp script. What a pity modern comedy can't reach that high standard. This programme is available on network DVD 
 Police Story is a stunning series of set pieces for Jackie Chan to show his unique talents and bravery. Some of the stunts here are among Jackie's best and most dangerous the whole mall fight finale is probably Jackie's greatest single fight sequence more brutal and less comedic then say Project A or Drunken Master at the end of the fight you can almost feel the pain of the impact. But unfortunately the rest of the film doesn't hold up to this quality as it is a rather formulaic cop thriller with some comedy elements. I always prefer JC in films such as Project A where his natural comic talents shine through. In the serious confines of some elements of Police Story it just doesn't work for me. Having said that though this is still up there with Jackies best films due to the incredible stunt work and sheer spectacle. As usual with Hong Kong films avoid the English dubbed DVD version as it is truly awful stick with the subtitles. Great stunts OK movie a fine starting point if you've not seen a JC movie before and well worth a watch for any movie fan 7/10 
 Scoop *** out of **** Woody Allen is definitely not my favorite director but I enjoyed Match Point. It was an excellent dark romantic thriller that luckily did not star Woody Allen. It did have the beautiful Scarlett Johansson in it. Scoop is Woody Allen's latest film and though he appears in this one it's OK. It also features Scarlett Johansson and the two of them work perfect together. Johansson plays Sondra Pransky a young college journalist who gets the scoop of a life time from the ghost of Joe Strombel (Ian McShane.) Joe heard the scoop while on a boat with the grim reaper and a bunch of other souls the Reaper has taken. One of those souls is the secretary of Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman.) She tells Joe that Peter may be the serial killer roaming the streets of England. Joe with the scoop of a life time travels back to the living and gives this info to Sondra during a magic act. Sondra is at some magic show with Magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen.) She becomes a volunteer to go in a disappearing box and while she is in the box she gets the visit from Joe. Not knowing what to do she enlists the help of Sid Waterman to help her crack the case. This film has a nice light-hearted feel to it compared to Match Point and yet it all works. Johansson and Allen work great together. Allen's humor fits perfect for this story and role. Hugh Jackman is terrific as Peter Layman the suspected serial killer. This is a fun little movie to see if your ever looking for one to watch. The cast ensemble works well together and the story flows and you sometimes forget that your watching Woody Allen be himself. I say give it a chance because you just might like it. 
 The first 2 parts seek to reduce to absurdity the rise of wasteful wars and rule by nationalist barbarians. The 3rd part speculates that progress and exploration toward the moon and beyond is the key to ensuring a meaningful use of human talents and resources. It has speeches that some viewers dismiss as naive or bombastic but that make others tingle with excitement. It depicts a space gun/launcher and a helicopter along with inventive mass communication devices elevators flat screen panels and wireless intercoms. It's probably incorrect about windowless buildings in the future. But it portrays a child-like vision of boundless scientific/technological investigation. To me it seems like a movie about a group of rational minded thinkers guided by a Spinozean-like morality in their quest to immortalize themselves and live ethically through scientific advancement and a unified world government. The pro-progress characters (such as the two Cabals) believe humanity could 'live forever' by preserving our experiments and progress for future generations always standing on our humanity as if on the shoulders of giants. Arthur C. Clarke (author of 2001: A Space Odyssey) suggested this film to Stanley Kubrick as an example of an excellent SF movie. Kubrick hated it and said he would never watch another movie based on Clarke's suggestions (source: Clarke's special millennial introduction to his 2001 novel). Though the late Clarke kept suggesting it at the top of his list whenever someone asked him about the best SF movies. It has a beautiful Menzies art design but mediocre special effects (esp. the toy tanks). I personally loved it and think it excellently captures the zeitgeist of modernity. It is a bit naive about the plausibility of creating a society without crime for an extended period of time. It also seems implausible about the inevitability of progress. It seems to me we could just as easily go right back to the dark ages or at least become so stagnant in science that we kill ourselves off through overpopulation or through our inability to escape the next major natural disaster. But it nicely portrays the importance of taking risks against public and nanny outrage for potential threats of space accidents and deaths. It challenges us to choose the side of progress over petty desires for safety or comfort or happiness: CABAL: Too much {rest} and too soon and we call it death. But for MAN no rest and no ending. He must go on--conquest beyond conquest. This little planet and its winds and ways and all the laws of mind and matter that restrain him. Then the planets about him and at last out across immensity to the stars. And when he has conquered all the deeps of space and all the mysteries of time--still he will be beginning. CABAL: If we are no more than animals--we must snatch at our little scraps of happiness and live and suffer and pass mattering no more--than all the other animals do--or have done. {He points out at the stars.} It is that--or this? All the universe--or nothingness... (quotes from screenplay). If this sounds like a rationalization for devoting all of society to progress then the council members (of the world government) will seem like technocrats. But actually those technocrats allow their citizens to become artisans or pursue other passions freely and they would have to be suppressed by government bans laws against science and experiment and other mandates and restrictive uses of power that would turn their critics into tyrants. In fact a huge group of rebels in the plot feel belittled by all the council's developments of science and technology so they try to put a stop to progress and an end the council's freedom to experiment. The progress oriented council will not suppress the free speech of the rebels though only preparing its 'peace gas' in times of emergency and merely wanting the freedom and space to pursue its progress. So it's also a story about the freedom to do science just as much as it's about the wonders of progress. Many people in our society would actually agree with some of these basic premises except in cases of social bias (many want to ban cloning for example) or naturalism (some don't want us to progress freely and would rather we just become extinct in due time while enslaved to the earth) or fear/reason (some believe we aren't ready for advanced science/technology since we might destroy ourselves). But Cabal (the president of the council) has an answer to the problem of danger: Our {scientific} revolution did not abolish death or danger. It simply made death and danger worth while (screenplay). 
 Zombie Chronicles isn't something to shout about it's obvious not a award winning movie but it is a entertaining B-movie directed by Brad Sykes who directed Camp Blood which was another entertaining low budget flick. The acting is bad like most cheaply made movies but that's what makes it more entertaining the zombie make-up is cool and effective especially with the budget the gore is also great and gross the film is sort of like a zombie version of Tales from the Crypt since we get two tales about zombie encounters in the woods the stories are fun and do leave you guessing especially the first tale. Zombie Chronicles is a lot better than some low budget zombie movies out there if you love low budget B-movies or cheaply made zombie flicks then check out Zombie Chronicles. 
 Sure the history in this movie was Hollywoodized --but it's far from being the only bit of history rewritten for the masses. Lafitte sided with the Americans because he considered himself a Frenchman and therefore hated the British not because of any sense of patriotism for a nation that had taken over New Orleans only a short time ago; he broke his agreement and returned to smuggling which caused his sailing to Galveston; he was more of a petty criminal and scoundrel than a hero *or* a swashbuckler. But who cares? This is one movie that's sheer entertainment--and face it we all wanted Jean to go for the feisty wench rather than the prudish daughter of the governor. Brynner once again rises over mediocre writing to give a fascinating performance. 
 Pecker is a hilariously funny yet twisted film about a small town in Baltimore whose daily humdrum routine is broken by Pecker a young photographer who takes pictures of real things. No pretty models no gorgeous men just hard living. This wonderful film pokes fun at the plasticness of the urban art chain. There is one particular scene when a homeless woman who shops at Pecker's mom's thrift shop buys the same exact coat as one of the Whitney art junkies for only 25 cents instead of five hundred dollars. This just goes to show you that no matter what kind of money you have you might not always have taste. Yet again John Waters sends you into a never-ending spiral of laughter and raw reality. You can have your mainstream Hollywood movies with special affects and mountains of celebrities but give me a Pecker or a Hairspray (another excellent John Waters film) over a Titanic or a Godzilla anyday!! 
 I just saw the movie on tv. I really enjoyed it. I like a good mystery. and this one had me guessing up to the end. Sean Connery did a good job. I would recomend it to a friend. 
 The brilliance of this movie is that even a competent dentist is pretty scary. It's one of man's primal fears. This movie is the nightmarish image every kid has to go through in the waiting room. Corbin Bernsen gives a surprisingly non-lackluster performance as a crazed dentist who I guess tries to kill people but he only works on their teeth so it's not really working out. In a particularly gory scene we find so-so actor Earl Boen having his teeth completely destroyed with drills and whatnot which I guess is the absolute worst you can do when you're a killer dentist. It's a typical Brian Yuzna situation not well written but there's gore. The plot is shoddy and at times seems to be made up on the spot but hey it's a killer dentist movie we've all thought of it but they did it first. 
 La Teta y la Luna is a symbolic spain film. Everything that in this film occurs has a symbolic meaning. It is totally different to the usual movie that one has access. This film is good but it will be good only for the people who want look for the meaning of everything in the film's tale. I must advice that this is not a sample film. Please enjoy!!! 
 Once upon a time in a castle...... Two little girls are playing in the garden's castle. They are sisters. A blonde little girl (Kitty) and a brunette one (Evelyn). Evelyn steals Kitty's doll. Kitty pursues Evelyn. Running through long corridors they reach the room where their grandfather sitting on an armchair reads the newspaper. Kitty complains about Evelyn while Evelyn is looking interestedly at a picture hanging on the wall. Evelyn begins to say repeatedly: I am the red lady and Kitty is the black lady . Suddenly Evelyn grabs a dagger lying nearby and stabs Kitty's doll and then cuts her (the doll's) head. A fight ensues. And Evelyn almost uses the dagger against Kitty. The grandfather intervenes and the worst is avoided. Later on their grandfather tells them the legend related to the picture hanging on the wall in front of them in which a lady dressed in black is stabbing a lady dressed in red: A long time ago a red lady and a black lady lived in the same castle. They were sisters and hated each other. One night for jealousy reasons the black lady entered the red lady's room and stabbed her seven times. One year later the red lady left her grave. She killed six innocent people and her seventh victim was the black lady. Once every hundred years the events repeat themselves in this castle and a red lady kills six innocent victims before killing the black lady herself. The grandfather ends his tale by saying that according to the legend sixteen years from now the red queen should come again and kill seven times. But he assures them that this is just an old legend. Sixteen years pass..... This is the very beginning of the film. There are many twists and surprises in the film. It's better for you to forget about logic (if you really analyse it the story doesn't make sense) and just follow the film with its wonderful colors the gorgeous women the clothes the tasteful decor the lighting effects and the beautiful soundtrack. Enjoy Barbara Bouchet Sybil Danning Marina Malfatti Pia Giancaro among other goddesses. There's a nude by Sybil Danning lying on a sofa that's something to dream about. And don't forget: The lady in red kills seven times! If you've liked La Dama Rossa... check out also La Notte che Evelyn usc¨¬ dalla Tomba . 
 wow! this is a good movie! The acting wasn't good at all but if you look at some moments in the film rewind and watch it again it is genius! The man in the begin of the film walks with his suitcase against a three. WOW!I never expected that. Then he puts the coke in a suitcase and runs away. I bet that smoking guy against that three was one of his mates who sold the drugs later. And the genius quotes: ''nice shades i need a pair'' ''their yours.. if you think you can take them..''.. just Brilliant! And the fighting is the best i've seen in a while. Look at the second guy he takes down after he hit the head of the first guy against the table. WHAT A HIT! And in the middle of the film one guy in a car shot one time then 3 guys fall he is really good at aiming. It costs a lot of money to hire these guys like him. The end was brilliant it was so exciting that james cahill walks 5 minutes up and down the stairs and shoot jason peters after his distraction moves. Jason Peters falls down and roll over again while he is dead! I can't say with more words how great this movie is! 
 I completely disagree with the other comments posted on this movie. For instance the movie is based on the book and if the writer had a gay character in it then how could Hollywood just throw in a token gay character in the movie. And besides there was two gay characters and I thought they reflected each other great. One was normal and the other was more feminine but it wasn't over the top. And Diane Keaton gave a wonderful performance and if the other reviewer had the decency to actual watch the entire film they would have seen that her character developed through out the film by interacting with the other characters. For instance when she and Adam went to look at the car that Sara crashed in the junkyard you could see the maternal side of her come out and later in the film you saw that she too was invincible. But I guess if you're too worried about gay characters and characters that are flawed then this movie is bad. But if you're more open-minded and I don't know actually have some inkling of what is good then you'll enjoy this film. 
 Warning! Spoilers ahead! SPOILERS I've seen movie in German so it might be that I missed some clues. Despite some weakness in the plot it's a movie that came through to me. I liked especially Lexa Doig's acting. Sometimes I got impression that she *is* Camille. But I can't stop wondering what happened at the end with Bob Cassie and baby. I belive she after initially being set on Bob eventually ended up loving him and regretting what happened with his brother and being forced to lie to him. Otherwise it's a bit strange that she would carry his baby and love it. It's up to viewer to decide - and I don't like such endings. Dean Cain was as good as ever Eric Roberts .. well I've seen him better but also worse. I believe that the film is more an analysis of human relations and reacting in unexpected situations than a crime story. Bottom line is I liked it very much. 
 This installment very much makes the CIA look like a very foolish organization. In reality perhaps they are. After all the way the plot goes on this it very much looks like one man has the power to sanction killing everyone including his own people in order to kill Jason Bourne. Matt Damon does a very credible job as Bourne trying to stay one step ahead of being killed the entire film. He is still trying to remember who he was & how he has gotten where he is. He gets help from a couple of folks & it seems like every minute of the film somebody is trying to kill him. There is little time for rest in this film & the action sequences seem very very real. There are a lot of chase sequences filmed with the shaky cam which in a way add to the realism & make it seem less Hollywood than many pictures. These sequences add realism to the film in feeling. The suspense in some of the sequences is brilliantly done as you wonder if someone is going to die or if Bourne can head them off. This is the kind of action suspense you go to see when you want to be entertained & I am sure this one will lead to the next film in the series. 
 Tremendous black--and-white nighttime cinematography and plenty of it highlights this supposedly-true life account of a 1950s murder in Kansas in which an entire family was wiped out by two men. The story was written by Truman Capote so you get the very Liberal anti-death penalty message at the end of the film which is ludicrous knowing the facts of this case. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson play the two atheist losers who have twisted outlooks on life and who unnecessarily murder this nice family. Despite the annoying slant at the end this is a riveting story from the start and the cinematography makes this even more fascinating. Famed photographer Conrad Hall did a fantastic job on this. It makes me wish more modern-day films were made in black-and-white. See it on DVD. Blake Wilson John Forsythe Jeff Corey and the entire supporting cast are excellent in here. My third viewing of this film came in early April of 2005 shortly after Blake in real life was pronounced innocent in the murder trial of his wife. One can't help but look at Blake and this film differently after that. 
 This 1939 film from director John Ford and writer Lamar Trotti tells a fictional tale of young lawyer Abraham Lincoln his trials (literally) and his tribulations. It's a sentimental film reasonably well made but hardly breathtaking. The casting of Henry Fonda as Lincoln seems a mistake for while the actor had the right doleful qualities for the part even with several inches of makeup and a false nose he's way too handsome for Honest Abe who was famously homely. It's a good try from Fonda who's nothing if not sincere but his miscasting throws the entire film off. The supporting cast is excellent though and includes Alice Brady Ward Bond and Donald Meek. But Ford is too reverential in his treatment of Lincoln who is presented as just shy of a saint and in the final scene the movie goes way over the top. 
 It's beyond my comprehension that so much rubbish from Norway has been remastered for DVD release and still gems like this don't get a shot at recapturing their past glory. I give this a 7 not because it is very good but because it is one of the few SciFi films made for Norwegian television. This film is nothing less than a film-historic gem that in so many ways foreshadows the first Alien film. And my word Blindpassasjer was first! Did Ridley Scott or anyone in the crew see the mini-series? However unlikely the fact remains that the scenes are extremely similar. Okay the budget is _much_ lower in the Norwegian film but given that it's a really well-done piece of work from the desolate age of Norwegian movie-making which incidentally lasted until the 90s. 
 Jerome Crabbe has the lead role in this movie. I saw this movie 6 times and I still am not tired of it. This movie is similar to Flesh + Blood in some ways. Gerald Soetman is a great writer. He wrote all of Paul Verhoeven's Dutch films. Paul Verhoeven is one of the greatest directors. I have seen all of his movies all except for Showgirls. My Mom does not like him so much but I disagree. I think all of his films are a ride to watch especially Total Recall and Basic Instinct. Jerry Goldsmith did some of his movies which include Total Recall Basic Instinct and Hollow Man. I wish Jerry Goldsmith never died. Dutch films are different but still enjoyable. 
 This is by far my favorite film of all time. That's mainly because it's not afraid to delve into some very politically incorrect topics (such as spanking and female submissiveness) that other mainstream films are just too timid to touch. Nothing seems to be off-limits in this film as the director freely develops the story without any concern given to possibly offending the viewer. However I don't think anything was done here purely for shock value or to purposely offend anyone. Sean Young turns in an excellent and courageous performance. Most established mainstream actresses would not have taken on this role or would have asked for some major script changes before accepting it. The other cast members do a fine job as well. Have you noticed that this movie hasn't appeared on pay cable since an obligatory brief run a year after it hit the theaters? Have you ever wondered why? The obvious reason is that it just doesn't fit today's political atmosphere. It seems quite ironic to me that some premium channels now carry softcore porn (that's getting closer and closer to hardcore porn) but will not carry a mainstream movie like Love Crimes . Sadly even though this movie is only 11 years old it could probably not be made today. 
 This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. If you know the Real World and the people from those shows this movie will be top notch if you have never seen the real world you will still think it is an extremely funny movie but you won't get some of the inside jokes about the actors and the tv show. 
 Stupid Stupid Stupid. I think that Angelina Jolie is probably one of the most talented actress' today but a movie like this isn't just worth her time. She deserves better and so does everyone else in this movie. Talent is just wasted. Sorry but i don't feel like writing a review for this. I give it NO stars out of *****. 
 What a delightful romp ? a very competently made film that has so much charm and a feelgood factor that a lot of romantic comedies lack. Einstein is brilliantly acted by Walter Matthau while Meg Ryan's Catherine is unforgettable ? better than I have seen her in those films opposite Tom Hanks ? as the young mathematician struggling to be recognized. You don't need to be a young woman to understand Catherine's struggle and feel sympathetic for her immediately and as a young man it's easy to understand what must have gone through Ed's (Tim Robbins) mind in pursuing his true love. There's universal appeal in these emotions even if I.Q. keeps it all light fun and tied up nicely. Sure it's not heavy but if you look there are some subtexts. People remember Albert Einstein as a scientist yet he was a great spiritualist; his sayings such as something along the lines of 'If it is not impossible then why do it?' suggest he is a believer in fulfilling higher goals beyond one's immediate grasp. In this film there are questions of what an accident really is ? such as whether Albert and his whacky sidekicks' intervention in prying Catherine away from stiff-upper-lip loveless James (Stephen Fry ? who gives this otherwise cardboard character life and you cannot help but feel for his lack of feeling) counts. How much intervention happens in our lives that we do not see and comes across as serendipitous? And of course we'd like to think in real life despite what we often observe of the people we know that we Edwards get the Catherines and Jameses have to learn how to defrost the icewater in their veins. How nice to know that it might work out in I.Q.'s innocent (and disturbingly exclusively Caucasian) Eisenhower-era land of make-believe. 
 IQ is a wonderfully original romantic comedy that pits the greatest and deepest-thinking scientific minds of the 20th century as Cupid's helpers. The juxtaposition of heart and mind is the central theme of this light-hearted yet thoughtful movie. You don't quite know how to react because part of the time you are seeing great scientists do silly things to nurture budding love but at other times you hear them discuss some of the deepest puzzles of space/time of our age. The end result is a fun movie with surprises throughout. Walter Matthau is a perfect Einstein Meg Ryan creates a quirky scatter-brained mathematician and Tim Robbins brings to life the contradictions of a poorly educated working man who is fascinated by science. All together they create a farcical trip through love and science mind and heart. 
 Who wouldn't want to go on road trip with Peter Falk? That guy's right eye has more character than most actors today. This is the kind of funny and touching movie we are all looking for as a counterbalance to all the bombastic special effects bores. Women are going to love it for all the wake-up romance advice for men and men will love it for its spot-on father/son character study--one great little scene after another. And it has just enough of an edge to be a true indie find. Obviously this is a labor of love for Paul Reiser who understands what it's like to be both a father and a son as well as to have both laughter and tears as you move through life. The most fun part though was watching Reiser watch Falk. You could tell it was both his character coming to a new appreciation of his father and a fellow actor really enjoying Peter Falk's special craft. Really delightful. Let's hope this film makes it into theaters around the country sometime soon so everyone can have a chance to laugh and cry with Paul Reiser and folks. 
 GBS wrote his own screen adaptation of this Nobel Prize winning play but didn't live to see it produced (he had won an Oscar in 1938 for his brilliant adaptation of his 1914 play PYGMALION). When Otto Preminger mounted (produced and directed) this production in 1957 seven years after Shaw's death he had noted British author Graham Greene do the adaptation and it was a solid choice. Taking a cue from Shaw's own screenplay Greene uses material from the stage Epilogue to create a framing device to meld the two acts of the play (one early and one late in Joan's story) into a unified and most satisfying whole. Where on stage the shift in tone is buffered with an intermission here it works just as well with a return to KING Charles Balois's bedchamber (where the man Joan put on the throne is dreaming of the events which led to his current situation) and more material from Shaw's Epilogue - the introduction of the shade of John Gielgud's Warwick (the English king maker ). The majority of the language is solid GBS and the performances from stalwart Shauvians (like Felix Aymler's Inquisitor or Harry Andrews' de Stogumber) to relative newcomers (the film established Jean Seberg's career) are first rate. It may jar some only familiar with Richard Widmark's many movie villains to see him playing a frail and somewhat silly Dauphin but the performance - oddly top billed - is professional even if arguably miscast. The symbolism of the opening credits and the director's choice to use the visual vocabulary of black and white filming all serve Shaw and the story well. Go in expecting quality entertainment and you won't be disappointed. 
 You know? Our spirit is based on that revolution it's asleep... I can explain I think!! Well... Until that happen on 25th April 1974 our freedom was limited we didn't had liberty of speech but when we got it at the revolution it seems that Portuguese People lost his opinion we don't use our liberty of speech! That's all a consequence of the revolution! I think that's clear!... About the movie... I think that it has a few mistakes on some character's acting but by the way I use to watch on Portuguese movies it's quite good!! I like it very much! 
 The movie is absolutely silly. But were you expecting a high-brow intellectual film based on a comic called Slam Dunk? Really? Jay Chou's acting isn't exactly the most moving thing I've ever seen but I certainly enjoyed the movie. Was it somewhere near the level of awesome that someone like Jet Li or Stephen Chow can produce? No not really. Was it thoroughly entertaining if you're just taking it at surface value? Absolutely. It's a movie about some Chinese eye-candy idols and musicians who can play basketball at an unreal level of expertise. There's an evil Triad-style dude and a wacky scheming guy who gets Jay Chou involved in all of this. A love interest. It's formulaic but really suspend disbelief for a while. Come on. It's called Kung Fu Dunk. What do you really think you signed on for? Do yourself a favor if you watch it - I found myself a copy with some Engrish subtitles that made the movie nigh unintelligible conversation wise but we got a great laugh out of it. They would appear to be extremely fixated on Jerusalem and the numbers 1 10. I laughed I cried I hurled. I'd watch it again. Especially for that fight scene in the bar. Well choreographed and well shot. I especially enjoy the plexiglass lit pool table - I'd LOVE to play on one of those. Slick enough for me but I dig on trash cinema. 
 Berlin-born in 1942 Margarethe von Trotta was an actress and now she is a very important director and writer. She has been described perhaps even unfairly caricatured as a director whose commitment to bringing a woman's sensibility to the screen outweighs her artistic strengths. Rosenstrasse which has garnered mixed and even strange reviews (the New York Times article was one of the most negatively aggressive reviews I've ever read in that paper) is not a perfect film. It is a fine movie and a testament to a rare coalescing of successful opposition to the genocidal Nazi regime by of all peoples generically powerless Germans demonstrating in a Berlin street. Co-writer von Trotta uses the actual Rosenstrasse incident in the context of a young woman's search for information about her mother's never disclosed life as a child in the German capital during World War II. The husband of Ruth Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) has died and in a surprising reversion to an orthodox Jewish lifestyle apparently hitherto in long abeyance Ruth not only sits shivah (the Jews' week-long mourning ritual) but she insists on following the strict proscriptions of her faith. Her apartment in New York City reflects the affluence secured by her deceased spouse's labors. Her American-born daughter Hannah (Maria Schrader) and her brother are a bit put-off by mom's assumption of restrictive orthodox Jewish practices but they pitch in. The mother coldly rejects the presence of Hannah's fiance a non-Jew named Luis (Fedja van Huet). A domestic crisis might well erupt as Ruth warns that she'll disown Hannah if she doesn't give up doting handsome Luis. Stay tuned. A cousin arrives to pay her respects and also drops clues to an interested Hannah about a wartime mystery about mom's childhood in Berlin. Hannah is intrigued - she queries her mom who resolutely refuses to discuss that part of her life. This is very very realistic. I grew up with parents who fled Nazi Germany just in time and I knew many children whose families in whole but usually in part escaped the Holocaust. Those days were simply not discussed. So Hannah having learned that a German gentile woman saved Ruth's life traipses off to Berlin hoping to find the savior still breathing. Were she not this would have been a very short film. But Ruth pretending to be a historian locates 90 year-old Lena Fischer (Doris Schade) now a widow. As the happy-to-be-interviewed but shaken up by repressed memories Lena tells her story the scenes shift fairly seamlessly between present day Berlin and the war-time capital. The young Lena of 1943 (Katja Riemann) was a fine pianist married to a Jewish violinist Fabian Fischer (Martin Feifel). With the advent of the Nazi regime he was required to use Israel as a middle name just as Jewish women had to add Sarah to their names(incidentally I wish IMDb had not given Fabian's name on its characters list with the false Israel included-it simply perpetuates a name applied by Nazis as a mark of classification and degradation). While Germany deported most of its Jewish population to concentration camps those married to Aryans were exempted. For a time. Until 1943 when the regime decided to take them too (most were men; a minority were Jewish women married to non-Jews). The roundup is shown here in all its frightening intensity. The young Lena tries to locate her husband. All she and many other women know is that they're confined in a building on Rosenstrasse. The crowd of anxious women builds up some piteously seeking help from German officers who predictably refuse aid and also verbally abuse them ( Jew-loving whore being one appellation). As a subplot Lena more or less adopts eight-year-old Ruth who hid when her mother was seized (remember Ruth is now sitting shiva in Manhattan). The child Ruth is fetchingly portrayed by Svea Lohde. Through increasingly angry protestations the women finally prevail. The men and a handful of women are released. As in the real story the Nazis gave in one of the rare almost unprecedented times when the madmen acknowledged defeat in their homicidal agenda (another was the termination of the euthanasia campaign to rid the Reich of mental defectives and chronic invalids but that's another story). Von Trotta builds up the tension and each woman's story is both personal and universal. Hannah continues to prod the aging Lena who slowly one gathers begins to suspect she's not dealing with an ordinary historian but rather someone with a need to learn about the girl she rescued the child whose mother was murdered. The contrasts between Rosenstrasse of 1943 a set and the street today in a bustling rebuilt unified Berlin provide a recurring thematic element. Today's Berlin bears the heritage but not the scars of a monstrous past. Von Trotta makes that point very well. The main actors are uniformly impressive. Lena's husband while strong is also shown as totally helpless in the snare of confinement with a likely outlook of deportation (which is shown to have been clearly understood by all characters - including the local police and military - as a one-way trip to oblivion). The older Ruth is catalytically forced to confront demons long suppressed in her happy New York life. Hannah is very believable as a young woman whose father's death triggers a need to discover her family's past. These things happen (although the Times's critic appears not to know that). Von Trotta's hand is sure but not perfect. A scene with Goebbels at a soiree enjoying Lena's violin playing is unnecessary and distractive. The suggestion that she may have gone to bed with the propaganda minister the most fanatical top-level Hitler worshiper to save her husband detracts from the wondrous accomplishment of the demonstrating spouses and relatives. Most of the German officers come from central casting and are molded by the Erich von Stroheim copy and paste school of Teutonic nastiness. But that's understandable. The Rosenstrasse story has been the subject of books and articles and some claim it's a paradigm case for arguing that many more Jews could have been saved had more Germans protested. Unfortunately that argument is nonsense. The German women who occupied Rosenstrasse were deeply and understandably self-interested. Most Germans were located on a line somewhere between passive and virulent anti-Semitism. THAT'S why the Rosenstrasse protest was virtually singular. Whether one buys or rejects the Goldenhagen thesis that most Germans were willing accomplices of the actual murderers it just can not be denied that pre-Nazi endemic anti-Semitism erupted into a virulent strain from 1933 on. The elderly Lena remarks that what was accomplished by the women was a ray of light in an evil time. Most of the men and women sprung from a near death trip survived the war. So a ray of light it was and von Trotta's movie is a beacon of illumination showing that some were saved by the courage of largely ordinary women and for every life saved an occasion for celebration exists. And always will. 9/10 
 At the time My Left Foot was the little movie that could. It was hugely popular and everyone applauded the fact that such a small independent film could make it all the way to the Oscars. Since then movies like My Left Foot are a dime a dozen so it might be hard in retrospect to understand what all the fuss was about. It's certainly a well made and competent film but it's clear that the bulk of its success rests on the shoulders of Daniel Day-Lewis who immerses himself in the role of Cristy Brown a man living with cerebral palsy. Day-Lewis pulls off the same bit of stunt acting that had won Dustin Hoffman an Oscar the year before for playing a man with autism in Rain Man and the Academy followed suit by giving Day-Lewis the same honor. The only thing really separating this film from a big budget Hollywood production is just that -- its budget. In every other way it's just as formulaic as any standard product. That's not to say it isn't a good movie but it's not a masterpiece. Grade: A- 
 While this was a better movie than 101 Dalmations (live action not animated version) I think it still fell a little short of what Disney could do. It was well-filmed the music was more suited to the action and the effects were better done (compared to 101). The acting was perhaps better but then the human characters were given far more appropriate roles in this sequel and Glenn Close is really not to be missed as in the first movie. She makes it shine. Her poor lackey and the overzealous furrier sidekicks are wonderful characters to play off of and they add to the spectacle Disney has given us. This is a great family film with little or no objectionable material and yet it remains fun and interesting for adults and children alike. It's bound to be a classic as so many Disney films are. Here's to hoping the third will be even better still- because you know they probably want to make one. ;) 
 This picture came out in 1975 and it was the second in the three part series of the life of Sheriff Buford Pusser. Bo Svenson takes over the role of Sheriff Buford Pusser and Luke Askew plays the role of Mobster Pinky Dobson. The last that we saw Sheriff Pusser he was laying in a hospital bed after him and his wife who was killed in ambushed Sunday morning drive. After Pusser recovers he goes after the men that killed his wife. Is Pusser able to complete the revenge that he's after or does the mob try to take him out before he successes. The only thing that bother me about this picture that this was an actual true story. How could you leave in a town with this kind of crime and yet don't do anything about it. Since there was real no name actress in this picture I can't give it 10 weasel stars but I can give 8 
 Upon the first viewing I found this tale to be at least less annoying than other Cannon Movie Tales. After many more I think it's one of the best. Some of the songs are pretty bad especially the love song but two things stand out that make the movie even the singing worthwhile. One is the art direction. Like the other Cannon Movie Tales this is a beautifully decorated period piece; every piece of cloth and jewel (both of which have major parts in this movie's plot) look fresh and new and contrast with the plain clothes of the peasants. Even during the love song I find myself studying the dress and hair of the princess wonderfully done. The other thing is the comic timing. A lot of the movie is cheesy but the emperor's vanity (and his making fun of himself in the end) the suspicious guard the guard chasing Nicholas and the stupid prince were all quite funny and seem to be ridiculous quite on purpose. And the sequence during the song Weave-O makes up for the songs that weren't so good. 
 I was not expecting much from this movie. I was given a ticket for an advanced screening. I had just gotten off of work. It was hot and I was tired. I had to wait in the movie line for 40 minutes and there seemed not to be any cool air flowing through the hallways of the theater complex. Once seated in the theater tired and frustrated the movie started I did not recognize any of the actors in the beginning but the flow of the movie was perfect. Right from the beginning I became consumed with the movie getting more and more excited with each minute passing. I think this movie is destined to be a fantasy/fairytale classic. The actors were fabulous the pace was perfect and the ending was magical. 
 Saw this on cable back in the early 90's and loved it. Never saw it again until it showed up on cable again recently. Still find it a great Vietnam movie. Not sure why its not higher rated. I found everything about this film compelling. As a vet (not from Vietnam) I can relate to the situations brought by both Harris and De Niro. I can only imagine this film being more poignant now with our situation in Iraq. I wish this would be offered on cable more often for people to see. The human toll on our soldiers isn't left on the battlefield. Its brought home for the rest of there lives. And this film is one of many that brings that home in a very hard way. Excellent film. 
 ELVIRA MISTRESS OF THE DARK (1988) directed by: James Signorelli starring: Cassandra Peterson W. Morgan Sheppard Daniel Greene and Edie McClurg plot: Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) quits her TV show and heads to the small Christian town Fallwell Massachusettes to collect on her dead aunt's inheritance hoping to make big bucks to open up a show in Vegas. Unfortunately for her all she gets is a creepy old house a poodle and a magic cookbook. While in Fallwell Elvira tries to make money breathe some life into the teenagers win the heart of a stud (Daniel Greene) avoid being burned at the stake and keep the cookbook from her creepy uncle (W. Morgan Sheppard) who is planning to use the book to end the world. my thoughts: I love both Cassandra Peterson and her alter-ego Elvira. She is a very successful beautiful and funny woman and as Elvira she's all that plus morbid and hilariously naive not to mention she has an amazing pair of knockers. In this movie her charms are put to good use. I loved the whole 'fish out of water' feel to the film. You got Elvira with her low-cut black dress her big black hair and her enormous 'twins' and she's in a Christian town where most of the girls aren't even allowed to wear makeup. This also makes her love story with Bob (Daniel Greene) a lot more entertaining. W. Morgan Sheppard is equally great as Elvira's uncle/nemesis Vincent out to steal the book to use it for evil. He has a lot of presence but still doesn't get in the way and steal scenes from Elvira. What really makes the film is not the plot but the many jokes. Everything from boob jokes to horror spoofing is here and makes me laugh a lot more than anything from a SCARY MOVIE sequel. I hear there are about 56 boob jokes in this film and any fan of Roger Corman B-horror flicks will love the spoofing in this film. If you love Elvira you will love this flick. Also check out ELVIRA'S HAUNTED HILLS. 
 The filmmaker inhaled Andy Goldsworthy's art his search for closeness with the land and the water and his sense of proportion -- and so gently so beautifully breathed it back on to film for the rest of us. Rivers and Tides loves Goldsworthy's work and joins it as a visual concert of time and human presence in a flowing world a world that hides its power in plain sight. See this movie! 
 This is the last of four swashbucklers from France I've scheduled for viewing during this Christmas season: the others (in order of viewing) were the uninspired THE BLACK TULIP (1964; from the same director as this one but not nearly as good) the surprisingly effective LADY Oscar (1979; which had originated as a Japanese manga!) and the splendid CARTOUCHE (1962). Actually I had watched this one not too long ago on late-night Italian TV and recall not being especially bowled over by it so that I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed it this time around (also bearing in mind the baffling lack of enthusiasm shown towards the film here and elsewhere when it was first announced as an upcoming DVD release from Criterion). Incidentally FANFAN LA TULIPE has quite a bit in common with the afore-mentioned CARTOUCHE: not just cast and crew members (producers Georges Dancigers and Alexandre Mnouchkine cinematographer Christian Matras actor Noel Roquevert) but plot-wise as well ? in fact the hero is a womanizing soldier (Jean-Paul Belmondo's Cartouche had also had a brief military spell) who's loved by a fiery girl (in this case gypsy Gina Lollobrigida) while he's himself obsessed by an impossible love (here it's none other than the king's daughter)! As in the later film too Fanfan (an ideally cast Gerard Philipe who ironically is so full of life here that one finds it hard to believe that he would be stricken down by cancer within 7 years' time) is flanked by two fun-loving yet cowardly men (one of them is actually his superior officer and the heroine's own father) and opposed by an unscrupulous figure within his own ranks (the ageing Roquevert with whom the hero eventually engages in a rooftop duel since he too has amorous designs on the gypsy girl)!; for the record Lollobrigida will rejoin Philippe in her next film Rene Clair's delightful romantic fantasy LES BELLES DE NUIT (1952). FANFAN proved to be a big box-office hit on its home-ground and even copped a surprising (but well-deserved) Best Direction award at Cannes over more renowned films like AN American IN Paris (1951) DETECTIVE STORY (1951) OTHELLO UMBERTO D. and VIVA ZAPATA! In fact its popularity ensured its re-release in a computer-colored version (presumably for the benefit of viewers who wouldn't touch a black-and-white product with a ten-foot pole) and the Criterion DVD itself contains a sample from this variant; being obviously a foreign-language title there's also the dubious choice of an English-dubbed soundtrack but even if these proved not especially painful to sit through considering when all is said and done there's simply no substitute for the original! FANFAN LA TULIPE (a nickname given the hero by a young Genevieve Page as the celebrated Madame De Pompadour) contains about as much comedy as (the expected) action and romance; while some may find this overwhelming I don't agree myself as I enjoyed the sharply satirical narration and on the whole this combination is comparable with Jerzy Skolimowski's equally droll THE ADVENTURES OF GERARD (1970). That said the swordfights here are remarkably forceful for an essentially lighthearted enterprise (particularly a scuffle in the woods and the ambush at a convent) and the film itself rather adult at times (with numerous allusions to sexuality as well as coarse language adopted throughout) when viewed back-to-back with vintage Hollywood fare as I did now; the climax then is quite ingenious: the enemy forces (who amusingly are made to speak in speeded-up gibberish!) are depleted by our heroic trio alone much to the king's amazement who as portrayed by Marcel Herrand ? best-known for his role of leader of the Parisian underworld in Marcel Carne''s CHILDREN OF PARADISE (1945) ? is himself something of a lecher. P.S. An Italian TV channel has been threatening to screen Christian-Jaque's promising CHAMPAGNE FOR SAVAGES (1964) for months now but despite programming it three times already (with a tentative fourth one slated for next week) they have yet to show it; even so I do have three more films of his in my unwatched VHS pile (equally culled from late-night Italian TV screenings): the three-hour epic LA CHARTREUSE DE PARME (1948; also starring Gerard Philippe) THE SECOND TWIN (1967) and THE LEGEND OF FRENCHIE KING (1971; with Brigitte Bardot and Claudia Cardinale). 
 For someone who remembers Jane in the Daily Mirror strip cartoon viewing this film is an exercise in nostalgia. In that context it is wonderful but younger viewers would undoubtedly find the comedy limp and would miss the point that the actors are cartoon characters. The plotline is also a bit limp for today's audience but reflects the naivety of the 40s and 50s very well. Jane you must remember was part of the escapist fantasy of the wartime years created to boost the morale of the troops. She gave a double meaning to the strip in strip cartoon. The story has something in common with the tales of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Rider Haggard. The theme would have been a familiar one to readers in that era a bunch of bumbling Nazis thwarted by a few equally bumbling Englanders and set in the African jungle of course. For Jane fans a must see. For the rest of you a damp squib. 
 Weak fast and multicolor this is the Valvoline's movie in fact you can see always this brand of oil in a lot of scene. The real protagonist are the cars weak performances of Cage and Duvall. A intresting Angelina Jolie is a unlikely mechanic. For the lovers of dream car(LAMBORGHINI and FERRARI over all). 
 Darius Goes West is the touching story of a brave teen coping with Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy and his personal quest to see the Pacific Ocean. He receives help and encouragement from a group of young men who love and care for him while going on this quest. The story has a natural drama and honest portrayal of the commitment of young people to help one of their own stricken with this incurable disease. Anyone who thinks young people are self-centered and narcissistic will find this movie to turn that stereotype on its head. It is the power of the young people and their engagement with Darius' plight that is very compelling in this documentary. 
 Cinderella is a film about a young girl whose mother passed away and her father remarried. Once her father died Cinderella's stepmother became very mean to her and made her do all of the chores around the house like cleaning up after her two evil stepsisters. One day the King sent out a message to all of the single women to attend the Royal Ball in honor of his son to find a wife. Of course Cinderella didn't get to go but her stepsisters did. Cinderella was very upset and thought that there was no way she could attend the Royal Ball until her fairy godmother appeared. So she did some magic and made Cinderella into a beautiful woman but she had to be back by midnight because that is when the magic changes back. While at the Royal Ball Cinderella loses track of time and the clock strikes midnight so she runs out of the palace and loses her glass slipper. Then the King orders the duke to find the women who wore that slipper. The duke searched every house but finally found the women who it belonged to Cinderella. Clyde Geronimi Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luske directed one of the best animated Disney films in 1950. This film is about a magical fairytale. In the beginning of the film Cinderella was a servant to her own family and had nobody to love her but with a little bit of magic her whole life changed around and finally found love. My favorite thing about Cinderella is the music. When Cinderella's fairy godmother appeared doing her magic she sang the song Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo. When I was a child it was one of my favorite songs to sing around my house so I will never forget it. I also loved the part when Cinderella and the Prince were singing the song So This is Love while they were dancing because they realized that they are in love. Overall this film was my favorite film when I was a little child because every little girl wants to live a fairy tale life. 
 This film is close to be my favorite piece of celluloid. There is really not much I'd need or want to say here. Except maybe See this film and Enjoy the excellent work by Daniel and Pascal who carries you through this neat funny and heartbreaking story about 'spending your eighth day' - your own day! Seeing this film made me think seriously about how I spend my eighth day = my life! It appears that some of us are wasting precious time doing things we think we need to do. Either if it's pleasing a career or just consuming TV-shows and ballgames. What we tend to miss is the satisfaction of being something for another person - make a difference. About taking room and time to be spontaneous and live - NOW! (on the eighth day)... At least that was what I got from 'The Eighth Day'. 
 When I was very young on a local tv station they would show kung fu movies of all kinds on Saturdays.I saw lots of Kung Fu movies on weekends.I remember lots of them.I saw great flicks like Crippled Masters Blind Fist of Bruce Kung Fu Zombie Shaolin Drunken Monk Rage of the Master Tattoe Dragon and...Five Deadly Venoms.I remember the day clearly.Me and my dad had just gotten lunch at Burger King.We were racing home to see what movie it would be this saturday.We ran in the house and jumped onto the couch turned on the set and flicked it onto 56.The usual intro of many kung fu movie clips in the background with the words Kung Fu Saturday over it.Then under that was the Title of the film.It said Five Deadly Venoms.Then the movie began.I bit into my burger amused with the pre-credit sequence.I loved this movie the minute it came on.My favorite character was the Toad Venom.The plot was hard to follow at that age but that wasn't what lured me...it was the fighting.The fights were so...amazing.I moaned every time a commercial came on and soon the 2 hours of the best movie i have ever seen ended. 
 This is an evocative and idealized portrait of the early life of Lincoln(born 1809 Hodgensville-Kentucky- and died in Washington 1865). Ford's excellent movie takes Abraham Lincoln(Fonda) from his youth. He studied laws common law and began practice as lawyer in 1837.This Hollywood biography follows Lincoln from his log-cabin days initial relationship to Mary Todd(Weaver) following the couple from their first ball and his departure for congress candidate. But focuses mainly on a brothers(Richard Cromwell Eddie Quillan) accused for murder the posterior trial with amusing court debate scenes and the protection for their mum(Alice Brady). The Lincoln-Fonda as defender advocate and Donald Meek-prosecutor are nothing short of brilliant. Excellent performance from Henry Fonda as idealistic traveller Springfield solicitor he was to star regularly for Ford from this movie as ¡§Grapes of wrath My darling Clementine and Fort Apache¡§. Besides sterling acting by Alice Brady as grieved mother she was a great actress from the silent cinema but this one results to be her last movie because she early died from cancer.The Lincoln's deeds developing make for skilfully appealing entertaining.His portrayal shows a nostalgic longing for things past and old values and describes his goodness uprightness and willful. Lincoln like John Ford was a straightforward man who never varied the ideals of his youth.This American masterpiece is correct on both counts as splendid biography and as magnificent drama. Another biographies about Abraham Lincoln are the following: 1) ¡§Abraham Lincoln¡§(1930) by D.W.Griffith with Walter Huston Una Merkel talking from his birth until his assassination; 2) ¡§Abe Lincoln in Illinois¡§(1940)by John Cromwell with Raymond Massey Ruth Gordon concerning similar events to Ford's film through his career as lawyer 3)TV version titled ¡§Gore Vidal's Lincoln¡§ with Sam Waterston and Mary Tyler Moore as Mary Todd. 
 So your bairns are away on a sleep-over ? The wife is visiting the mother in law? You though are at home. It's a dark and stormy night and there is no football on the telly and the dishwasher needs stacking? So now what are you going to do? I will tell you! Go make an old fashioned cocoa (Frys is best!)Get hold of some ginger nuts and sit down in front of the DVD. Now go select and play Arthur Askeys world war two thriller/horror The Ghost Train return to that comfortable settee and enjoy the night in! The Ghost Train is a genuine British war time classic! Arthur Askey with his side kick Stinker Murdoch entertain you and I suspect the cast to a high octane thrills and spills espionage thriller.It's set in old rural England during the second world war. It centres around a motley group of people that need to stay overnight through circumstances outside any ones' control in an old railway waiting room that they discover is haunted by an old train. The plot unfolds neatly and precisely and is a credit to the entire cast it is humorous in parts and at times genuinely scary! (The tale was written by that old boy Godfrey of Dads Army fame and it is clever ) Arthur Askey is entertaining and is very at home preforming his routines to you and the cast he also shows he can act a bit! The cast are never out staged though even the railway porter and the parrot help give the film the necessary gravitas. Oh and when it ends please remember to stack the dish washer! 
 Zu:The warriors from magic mountain was and is an impressive classic! You never would have guessed it was made in 1983. Tsui Hark's use of special effects was very creative and inventive. (He continued doing this in the Chinese Ghost Story trilogy and later productions.) Even now it can measure up to other movies in this genre. Legend of Zu is connected to Zu warriors from magic mountain ! It is not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the plot of this one. The plot is a bit hard to follow. But to be honest it doesn't matter. It is all about the action and adventure! I always was wondering what Tsui Hark would do if he got his hands on CGI. Now we know he made this movie. Maybe it sometimes is too much but the overall result is so beautiful that I am not going to be critical about that. There is so much happening on the screen you simply won't believe! I think it is a big shame that this movie wasn't shown in theaters here in Holland. Because this movie is screaming for screen time in cinemas! This movie easily can beat big budget Hollywood productions like Superman Returns or Xmen 3. The only thing I do have to mention is the lack of humor! In most of Tsui Harks's movies he combines drama fantasy martial arts and humor. Somehow it is missing in this movie. Again I am not going to be picky about these small matters. Legend of Zu delivers on the action front with the most beautiful special effects you will see. A true classic! 
 Origins of the Care Bears & their Cousins. If you saw the original film you'll notice a discrepancy. The Cousins are raised with the Care Bears rather than meeting them later. However I have no problems with that preferring to treat the films as separate interpretations. The babies are adorable and it's fun watching them play and grow. My favourite is Swift Heart Rabbit. The villain is a delightfully menacing shapeshifter. I could empathise with the three children since I was never good at sports either. Cree Summer is excellent as Christy. The songs are sweet and memorable. If you have an open heart love the toys or enjoyed the original this is not to be missed. 9/10 
 One of John Ford's best films 'The Informer' doesn't feature any grand scenery of the American West. Instead the intense drama Ford was known for plays out on the no less rugged terrain of British character actor Victor McLaglen's face. The former prizefighter who once faced Joe Louis in the ring delivers an Academy Award-winning portrayal of disgraced IRA soldier Gypo Nolan on the worst night of his life. The plot is gracefully simple: In 1922 Dublin a starving and humiliated man who's been thrown out of the IRA for being unable to kill an informant in cold blood himself becomes an informant. For ¡ê20 he betrays a friend to the Tans and for the rest of the night he drinks and gives away his blood money in rapidly alternating spasms of guilt denial self-pity and a desperate desire to escape the consequences of his actions. It is the remarkable complexity given to the character of the seemingly simple Gypo that is the film's most impressive achievement. In most movies a burly lout of Gypo's type would be cast as the heavy he'd have at best two or three lines and be disposed of quickly so the hero and the villain could have their showdown. In 'The Informer' Gypo himself is both hero and villain while the showdown is in his inner turmoil every bit of which is explicitly shared with the audience. Because Liam O'Flaherty's novel had previously been filmed in 1929 RKO gave Ford a very modest budget. The director and his associates particularly cinematographer Joseph H. August turned this to their advantage in creating a claustrophobic masterpiece about a man at war with himself. In addition to McLaglen's Oscar 'The Informer' also won John Ford his first along with wins for Best Screenplay and Best Score. 
 Simply one of the best ever! Richard Brooks' adaptation of Truman Capote's non-fiction novel is truly an artistic achievement. Stunning black and white cinematography (that should have won an Oscar) a haunting Quincy Jones score and tremendous performances by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as the oddly-matched killers. This film was 0 for 4 at the Academy Awards and wasn't even nominated for Best Picture while Dr. Doolittle was. Go Figure! Although you don't get to know the Clutter family as well as you do in the book it was a good decision to focus more on Perry and Dick and the pain-staking process of tracking these guys down. John Forsythe is also impressive as Alvin Dewey. There are simply no flaws in this one. 10 out of 10. Best performance = Scott Wilson with R. Blake a close second. Highly recommended! 
 This movie is great the music with the exception of the very first song in the movie was awesome. The story line is awesome too it's just basically a wonderfull movie for ALL ages. I found the last battle scene awesome! Basically this was a great flick! 
 Currently on METOO's new schedule at 4 pm on weekdays right after Maverick and right before Wild Wild West (followed by Star Trek ). Don't know if I ever actually saw an episode of it when it was originally on but I'm really captivated by it. Offbeat unusual surreal stories set in a mythical West. Kind of the Naked City of Westerns. And the guest stars are there: Dan Duryea Lyle Bettger Brian Donlevy MacDonald Carey Rick Jason (as a treacherous Mexican) a young Dick Van Patten Jack Lord Noah Berry Jr. (as a colorful Mexican) Martha Hyer Marguerite Chapman even Ann Robinson ( War of the Worlds ) Gloria Talbott ( I Married a Monster from Outer Space ) It ran for EIGHT SEASONS over 200 episodes from January 1959 to December 1965. Eric Fleming is quite remarkable as trail boss Gil Favor the most stolid man that's ever lived with the code of honor of a Samurai and just the right balance between toughness and open-handedness. I would vote for him for President any day. (P.S. He had a very interesting biography: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0281661/ ) And a young Clint Eastwood is quite striking as his impulsive right hand Rowdy Yates. Also veteran Western actor and country music figure (the immortal One-eyed One-horned Flying Purple People Eater ) Sheb Wooley is there as seasoned scout Pete Nolan. And Paul Brinegar makes the most cantankerous character of a cook you could ask for as Wishbone . And then there's that great theme song performed by the immortal Frankie Laine. (Between that and the Maverick theme I've got Western theme songs running through my head all day.) I look forward to every episode; I'm collecting the whole set. A good time (not to mention a moo-ving experience) is always guaranteed as one waits to see if the boys will get their difficulties straightened out before the commercial. Rollin' rollin' rollin' . . .  
 A DOUBLE LIFE has developed a mystique among film fans for two reasons: the plot idea of an actor getting so wrapped up into a role (here Othello) as to pick up the great flaw of that character and put it into his life; and that this is the film that won Ronald Colman the Academy Award (as well as the Golden Globe) as best actor. Let's take the second point first. Is Anthony John Colman's greatest role or even his signature role? I have my doubts on either level - but it is among his best known roles. Most of his career Ronald Colman played decent gentlemen frequently in dangerous or atypical situations. He is Bulldog Drummond (cleaned up in the Goldwyn production not to be an arrogant racist) fighting crime. He is Raffles the great cricket player and even greater burglar trying to pull off his best burglary to save a friend's honor. He is Robert Conway the great imperial political figure who is kidnapped and brought to that paradise on earth Shangri-La. He is Dick Heldar manfully going to his death after he learns his masterpiece has been destroyed and knowing he is now blind and useless as an artist. I can add Sidney Carton and Rudolf Rassendyll to this list. But here he is not heroic. In fact he is unconsciously villainous - he murders one person and nearly kills two others. It does not matter that he is obviously mentally ill - his behavior here is anti-social. To me Colman should have gotten the Oscar for Heldar or Carton or Conway - all more typical of his acting roles. But the Academy has a long tradition of picking atypical roles for awarding it's treasure to it's leading members. Colman's Anthony John is a very good performance and at one point truly scary. When alone with Signe Hasso in her home she at the top of a staircase and him at the base they have an argument. She demands that Tony leave saying she won't see him. He stares at her his face oddly hardening in a way he never used before and he says Oh no you won't! He starts moving upstairs frightening Hasso and she runs into her room. He stops himself and leaves. It actually is the real highpoint of his performance - even more than his assaulting of Hasso on stage or of Edmond O'Brien or his killing of Shelley Winters. It showed his blind fury. For that moment it was (to me) an Oscar-worthy performance. But it is only that moment. I'm glad he was recognized for the role but he should have gotten the award for a more consistent performance. His actual performance in the Shakespearian role of Othello is not great but bearable. Too frequently he lets the dialog roll off his tongue in a kind of forced singing style (one wonders if that was due to the coaching of Walter Hampden who probably knew how to handle the role properly or a reaction to it). Nowadays Othello is played by an African American actor more frequently than a white one. Paul Robeson's brilliant performance in the role set that new tradition firmly into place. But the three best known movie performances of the part are those of Colman Orson Welles in his movie of OTHELLO and Laurence Olivier in his movie of his play production of OTHELLO. All three white actors did the role in black face. My personal favorite of the three is Welles who seems the most subtle. But even watching Welles' fine film version makes me angry that Robeson never got to put his performance (with Jose Ferrer as Iago) on film. Now the first question - can an actor get that wrapped up in a role? I heard different things about this. Some actors have admitted taking a role home with them from the theater or movie set. Others have found a role they have to be stimulating influencing them on a new cause of action regarding their lives or some aspect of life. But actually I have never heard of anyone who turned homicidal as the result of a role. It seems a melodramatic hackneyed idea. As a matter of fact it was not a new idea in 1947 with Cukor Kanin and Gordon. In 1944 a B feature THE BRIGHTON STRANGLER starring John Loder had used a similar plot about an actor who is playing an infamous Jack the Ripper type and who starts committing those type of killings after an accident affects his mind. There was an earlier movie in the 1930s in which an actor playing Othello gets jealous of his wife (I think the title was MEN ARE NOT GODS but I'm not sure). But due to Colman's name and career and Cukor's directing it is A DOUBLE LIFE that people think of when they recall this plot idea. It even reached comedy (finally) on an episode of CHEERS where Diane Chambers is helping an ex-convict who may have acting talent and they put on OTHELLO at the bar just after he sees her with Sam Malone kissing. Only Diane is aware of the personality problem of the ex-convict and can't delay the production long enough (she tries to start a discussion into the history and symbolism of the play). The cast of A DOUBLE LIFE was first rate and Cukor's direction was as sure as ever. So the film is definitely worth watching. But despite giving Colman an interestingly different role it was not his best work on the screen. 
 The emotional impact of this movie defies words. It is elegant subtle beautiful and tragic all rolled into two hours. This is Will Smith as he matures into his acting ability the full range of it. Who knew? I saw The Pursuit of Happiness and thought this must be a fluke for the blockbuster over-the-top actor Smith. His performances in both movies portray a whole other dimension to Smith a refinement of talent the selectivity of scripts I'm not sure but I view him differently now. Seven Pounds is one of those movies that in order to fully enjoy its essence you have to suspend your belief. Don't watch it for the plot watch it for the fragile condition of the human heart both literally and metaphorically. It is a story of human guilt atonement love and sacrifice. 
 I started watching the show from the first season and at the beginning I was pretty skeptical about it. Original movie was kind of childish and I was just looking for some sci-fi show while waiting for the BSG new season. But after few episodes I became a fan. I've loved the characters - the not-so-stupid-as-you-think-he-is Jack O'Neill the not-only-smart Samantha Carter the glorious Teal'c women and kids favorite and brilliant Dr. Daniel Jackson. Of course stories sometimes not serious sometimes even ridiculous but mostly it's not about technology or space fighting - it's about helping your friend even risking your life for him. It's about we don't leave anybody behind . Struggling to the end when all hope is lost. About the free will and all good qualities that makes a human - Human. And now it's breaking a record going 10th season and still doing good. 
 It is finally coming out. The first season will be available March 2007. It is currently airing on ABC Family from 4-5 pm eastern time Monday through Friday. The last episode will air on December 19th at 4:30. I missed it the first 100 times around. I wish I could buy the whole series right now. Who does she pick? I have to write 10 lines in order to reply to the first comment. What am I going to say. La da da de de. La da da de de nope only up to 8 how do I get to 9 almost almost awww 9 now I need 10 - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 I missed counted this is only number 8. Punky Brewster is pretty awesome too. Almost to 10 almost awwwwww. 
 WHEN I first saw this film in London in 1958 I was bowled over. I had never seen a film like this before. It had a strange hypnotic effect quite unlike the films that I had seen previously and it left a lasting impact. I believe that Odile Versios & Marina Vlady are sisters if not twins. Certainly the interaction is amazing in its power to influence the viewer. If this has been converted to DVD - in Region 2 format - and in the original French language I would love to hear about it & where it can be purchased. 
 I liked it... just that... i liked it not like the animated series... i love it!!!. The fact that this make less appealing is that we all try to compare and not to appreciate but this cartoon was awesome but it really didn't like it that much. There's too much people talking about Bruce being so cold but if this is around 5 years later anybody in a crime-fighting gang would get this angry and darker attitude so to me it isn't a flaw. Batgirl was awesome she really fit there as there isn't more Dick Grayson as a robin batman needed a good teammate not like the new robin he is just a child and you cant rely that much on a child. But heres what didn't work: The new artwork... it isn't horrible but... to me it does'nt work in a series like batman. This is a dark character with a maniac killer like the joker so you cant put this kind of artwork in this cartoon The joker isn't a bad design but i still like the past joker (but to me the BEST joker ever was the one who appeared in batman beyond:return of the joker) so this joker isn't near as good. The good thing about the joker is that it still mark Hamil voice. My favorite character: Harley Quinn (im in love for her) They put an awesome episode for her: Mad love (to me the best episode of this series). Here we finally know how she turned Harley Quinn and how the joker twisted her mind and it feel that atmosphere that you feel in the animated series darker no happy ending brutal fight with the joker (but too short) this is how it was to be ALL the series. BUT in general i didn't like how she made Harley in this series... in almost every episode they put funny but in a ridiculous way she get punched she say nonsenses she make flaws... c'mon she is funny in a way you can laugh with her not from her... and here they put ridiculous (like i said the only episode where i don't think that its in mad love and beware of the creeper) So in general its a good series it has it upsides and downs the drawn could be better ( MY GOOD!!! KILL THAT CATWOMAN!!!!) nice sound effects nice music nice voices and nice episodes: my favorites Mad love Jokers millions Old Wounds Sins of the father and Cold comfort. If you enjoyed Batman:TAS you can watch this but don't spec too much in the other hand if you didn't watched TAS watch this first and then watch TAS in that way you're really gonna love TAS :D 
 This is definatley one of the best stand-up shows evre. EVER. Eddie is so off the wall that I've been watching this damn show for nearly five years now and it still rocks every single time. Just everything from his big broad physical comedy down to the little off the top of the head side remarks it's a masterpeice. You need look no further than this line The word herb. You say erb and we say herb cuz ther's a f###ing h in it . Brilliant. 
 An independent feature can now be seen as both a work of film art and a video resume. Enter Broken and aggressively promoted twenty minute short with style and enthusiams to spare. But is it any good as a film or does it only work as a demo piece? Ah there in lies the rub. Broken is the story of Bonnie Clayton who is abducted after awakening from a reoccurring nightmare one night by a sadistic stranger and his colorful entourage (quote from the video box). As she's held captive it becomes obvious that her abductors know things about her that even she didn't know about herself. While they question her a black-clad soldier guns his way into their hideout in an attempt to rescue her. Mayhem ensues. Fortunately for us director Alex Ferrari seems to know what he's doing or at least he's very good at faking it. Broken does not suffer from any lack of visual flair which is especially commendable considering its budget and the inexperience of all involved. What it does suffer from is weak and kind of derivative writing. Think Long Kiss Goodnight meets The Matrix written ten minutes after reading Fight Club. The good news for Ferrari and producer/writer Jorge Rodriguez is that the story elements are easily ignored for the oodles of eye candy on display. Does the plot really matter that much in a twenty minute short meant to show off the technical skills of its creators? No not really. Though it would be unfair of me to overlook any negative aspects in light of the films budget and length. Broken is no genre classic. The biggest problem was that it actually would have worked better as a full-length feature. The final twist doesn't get enough build up time to be shocking. If Ferrari were allowed the time to slow burn the feature as needed plot elements would seem less random and the film more complete. Here's to knowing he's getting the chance. Audio Broken's Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation is second to none in the indie world. I've never heard such aggressive surround from such a small feature. The Matrix inspired soundtrack is very rich and deep gunshots have punch and even the dialogue gets in on the surround effects. Of everything presented on this disc it is the audio that speaks the praise for modern independent DVD production. Also included is an equally impressive Dolby 2.0 surround track which is the menu default. Extras There are literally hours of making of features to be found on this disc. There are so many extras in fact that I find it unrealistic to list and describe each of them here while still expecting my readers to continue reading. Whatever shortcomings the actual short may have the DVD is unprecedented in its informational resources. People who enjoyed the film can learn all there is to know about its production including everything from the conceptual art to the promotional campaign. Those with plans to make an indie film of their own can learn just about everything they need to know from these features. The extras are broken down into categorical menus. These include: pre-production production post-production after the short and cast and crew bios. From a critical standpoint I found that some of the sections were quite short. Had they been edited into one featurette per menu option they would've been less frustrating to navigate as the curser defaults to the top selection with every return to the main section menu. This is of course just nitpicking but perhaps for future DVD releases the filmmakers will take my advice to heart. It has six audio commentaries and hours of interview footage and talented people and despite the consonant salesmanship their true colours do shine through. The willingness to share their film-making secrets with anyone who picks up this DVD is quite generous. From the extras I learned what editing and effects software is most reliable and effective what brand of camera creates the most professional look for the lowest price even where to get cheap air soft weaponry. On top of this I was given several alternate options in case I found myself unable to locate any products used on this particular production. Wannabe filmmakers unwilling to read a book on the subject would do well to watch this DVD. Overall I've scored the actual short as a 6 out of 10 but wish there was an option for feature length potential and effort because I'd have scored it an 8 or 9 in these fields. I recommend the DVD for its features and as a perfect example of what can be done with a mere eight thousand American dollars. Those who purchase the DVD can think of themselves as ghost producers for a larger project as the more attention these guys get the more funding the feature-length version will get. 
 There are so many words I want to use to describe this movie but can't really do that can I? This movie is a movie to watch if you just want to sit laugh cry and then pee. I'm serious. Don't watch this movie if you're easily offended by profanity sex nudity homosexuality...and everything else associated with nature. Being a woman and that might not even be a factor I can watch this movie over and over again. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are absolutely brilliant. Along with all their other debuts I think Baseketball is the prize winner. I'm laughing now just thinking about some of the stupid things they do in the movie. Watch the movie!! That's all I'm going to say. It's sort of hard for me to leave this comment because I'm one of those people like Ozzy Osbourne who has a curse word in almost every line that blurts out of their mouth when they speak. So I'm keeping it professional. Best movie. Heck yeah!! 
 I'm not tired to say this is one of the best political thrillers ever made. The story takes place in a fictional state but obviously it deals with the murder of Kennedy. A truthful and honest district attorney (played by Yves Montand) does not believe that the murder was planned and executed by the single man Daslow (=Oswald) and though all other officials want to close the case he continuous to investigate with his team. The screenplay is written tight and fast and holds the tension till the end. Just the part dealing with the Milgram experiment about authorities is (though not uninteresting) a bit out of place. The ending sequence - explaining who Icarus really is - partly shot in slow motion and intensified by a Morricone soundtrack is the most powerful sequence I have ever seen in a movie. 
 Of course you could never go into a theatre and witness the types of sets you get in this film. From that point of view it is utter fantasy. But who cares? It is certainly true that you will not find this film listed in with Citizen Kane Battleship Potyomkin and all the other films the pseuds tell us we should be watching. Films like this are worth a hundred Citizen Kanes.It is about what cinema does best: great camera-work great settings and great performances. The three spectacular scenes at the end are probably best in the order they are presented keeping the best till last. I will gladly watch this film again and again and again and... 
 Of all the versions of the Odyssey (or of any Greek mythological story for that matter) this in my opinion is the best of them all. Almost true to the original storyline - with some minor deviations and omissions e.g. the absence of Scylla & Charybdis and the fact that Eumaeus the swineherd recognizes Odysseus in disguise in his hut - realistic acting and authentic scenery and costumes all contribute to make this a truly memorable masterpiece not some Hollywoodish sword-and-sandal B-flick. Notwithstanding the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are completely in Italian if one is familiar with the storyline he can still make heads and tails of what is going on and what the actors are saying (provided you have a good handy text of the Odyssey at hand). At least I did and so much so that it has inspired me to study the Italian language to better appreciate the movie even more. 
 Twelve Monkeys is odd and disturbing yet being so clever and intelligent at the same time. It cleverly jumps between future and the past and the story it tells is about a man named James Cole a convict who is sent back to the past to gather information about a man-made virus that wiped out 5 billion of the human population on the planet back in 1996. At first Cole is sent back to the year 1990 by accident and by misfortune he is taken to a mental institution where he tries to explain his purpose and where he meets a psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly who tries to help him and a patient named Jeffrey Goines the insane son of a famous scientist. Being provocative and somehow so sensible dealing with and between reason and madness the movie is a definite masterpiece in the history of science-fiction films. The story is just fantastic. It's so original and so entertaining. The screenplay itself written by David and Janet Peoples is inspired by a movie named La Jet¨¦e (1962) which I haven't seen but I must thank the director and writer of the movie Chris Marker for giving such an inspiration for the writers of Twelve Monkeys . I read a little about La Jet¨¦e it's not the same story but it has the same idea so this is not just a copy of it. David and Janet Peoples have transformed this great deal of inspiration to a modernized story which tells about this urgent need for people to find a solution for maintaining human existence and it does it in a so beautiful and a realistic way that it's a guaranteed thrill ride from the beginning till the end. The music used in the film is odd and somehow so funny and amusing it doesn't really fit until you really get it and when you do you realise that it's so compelling composed by Paul Buckmaster. Terry Gilliam who we remember from Monty Python as the director of the movie was a real surprise for me as I really never thought him as a director type of a person. I know he has directed movies before but I really couldn't believe that he could make something this magnificent. It shouldn't be a surprise though as he does an amazing job. You can still sense that same weirdness as in the Python's but for me the directing is pretty much flawless though in its odd way of describing things it also makes some scenes strangely disturbing. Yes it is indeed odd weird bizarre and disturbing so it also makes the movie a bit heavy too so the weak minded viewers will probably find it hard to watch the movie all the way through. It's not as heavy as you could imagine but it just has these certain things which in their own purpose are sometimes pretty severe to watch. Despite that the movie holds this pure intelligence inside it and through flashbacks dreams jumps between the past and the future it mixes up the whole story in a very clever way and it doesn't even make the plot messy in any part though it does need concentration from the viewer after all. What comes to acting well the movie doesn't even go wrong there. The role of James Cole is played by the mighty Bruce Willis who probably does his best role performance yet to date. Now people may disagree with me as he did some fine job in for example The Sixth Sense as well but for me the role of James Cole was so ideal for Willis and he performs it incredibly well. The character is very well written too yet performed even better. Cole starts to question his own existence and he deals with himself starting to question his actual time of living trying to survive and find the crucial missing piece of the puzzle. By hardship he starts to loose his faith questioning if he can even trust or believe himself. Other role performances worth mentioning are the performances of Madeleine Stow and Brad Pitt. Stow plays the role of Kathryn Railly the psychiatrist of James Cole who sees something strangely familiar in Cole and decides to help him to deal with his madness. She somehow starts to believe Cole's story but as a believer of science she tries to find solutions through it and tries to deal with reason when it comes to unbelievable things. Brad Pitt is so good in the role of Jeffrey Goines and he also does one of his best role performances yet to date. The insane yet hilarious personality of the character brought Pitt even an Oscar nomination for it so I guess I'm not praising the honestly fabulous performance for nothing. All in all Twelve Monkeys is a great science-fiction experience and it will surely be a recommendation for everyone especially for the sci-fi fans. It includes brilliant characters and superb role performances especially from Willis and Pitt and an original and an entertaining story which forms a plot that's so intelligent and clever. Yet being that already mentioned weird and disturbing it definitely captures the viewer's attention by making it interesting and witty. It's also an explosive thriller and it has romance in it too so it's all that in same package and that makes it one of the best sci-fi motion pictures I've ever seen. Through the odd yet terrific vision of Terry Gilliam it manages to keep itself in balance despite the somewhat bumpy yet somehow stable ride. Hard to explain really but that's how it is it's mind blowing. 
 Some movies you just know you're going to love from the first few seconds. This is one of those movies. Tracing it's roots back to Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice in the 40's - this was a great example of Modern Film Noir in the 90's. Nick Cage plays the down on his luck main character who gets entangled in a husband-wife murder plot - and his luck goes from bad to worse to even worse as he tries and tries to get away from the people town violence and threat of Red Rock West. Lots of twists and turns great performances by Cage Hopper and Walsh an hypnotic slide-guitar musical backdrop and seamless directing make this a real joy. Favorite Line: When Cage looks at the empty gas gauge in the get-away car shakes his head and says: F***in' story of my life.  
 Mobile Suit Gundam Wing is the Fourth series in the continuing Gundam chronicles. Unlike the previous entries which focused on massive wars this one is a little different; instead of having an army-vs.-army situation this one is led by five teenage boys (due to their ability to blend in more readily than normal adults) and their machines called Gundams because of the metal alloy used in their construction. Which leads to problems since gundams are supposed to be destroyed replaced by Mobile Suits which are piloted less-destructive weapon platforms and Dolls which are ran on A.I. and are used as grunt infantry. The whole point of the series is a metaphysical question that gives Gundam Wing an edge over a greater portion of the Anime that makes it's way here. Especially since most anime is adapted from popular magazines such as Naruto DragonBall One Piece DragonBall Z and InuYasha which are all from Shonen Jump which is now available in America. Mobile Suit Gundam Wing sets itself apart from most anime in the fact that instead of over-the-top battles between mortals who more resemble gods Gundam is very humanistic and seems to revel in the fact that it is dramatic instead of melodramatic and events seem to unfold across the series gracefully. Normally in anime there are more than few series that think that the best way to go about having a small battle is to have it take a half-hour - something that would never happen in real life. Gundam tops this by making sure that everyone knows that characters will die machines will be destroyed and rebuilt battles will be lost and won and it never seems as though it makes the actions themselves satirical. But the magic of Gundam Wing is in the details and what this series has that more anime would be grateful for having. Emotion. Instead of mythic prophecies magic or overblown martial arts Gundam Wing is hard-line science fiction from a country that hates hard-line science fiction. (NOTE: The author would like to state that Neon Genesis Evangelion is not hard-line-plausible-in-real-life science fiction due to the religious subject matter that is the core of its series) they love Star Wars but hate A.I. (the movie). Henceforth why Gundam Wing was and Gundam SeeD is now in production for both Japanese and U.S. releases at the same time with two voice teams. American audiences only have to wait two or three weeks after the end of the Japanese season to catch the dubbed or subtitled versions or even the edited SeeD episodes that air on Cartoon Network. The emotion is that these two sides that are fighting a war are technically backwards. The heroes are those who defend the rights of the more wealthy and aristocratic citizens of Earth from the band of terrorists bent on victory at any and all costs that make up the protagonists of Mobile Suit Gundam Wing. This is not war this is total war . Every person every building every street is a target for attack both on Earth and off. My only complaint and the reason it didn't get the score of ten is that at about three-fourths of the way through it just kind of goes dead for a few episodes and no one really seems to change. Kind of like a present-time flashback which is fine due to what it reveals about the characters but at the same time it drags down what should be the brewing between Project: Meteor and OZ. But the final two episodes and the overplayed-on-Cartoon-Network (back in 2001-2003) Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz movie more than make up for the slack. 
 This amazing documentary gives us a glimpse into the lives of the brave women in Cameroun's judicial system-- policewomen lawyers and judges. Despite tremendous difficulties-- lack of means the desperate poverty of the people multiple languages and multiple legal precedents depending on the region of the country and the religious/ethnic background of the plaintiffs and defendants-- these brave strong women are making a difference. This is a rare thing-- a truly inspiring movie that restores a little bit of faith in humankind. Despite the atrocities we see in the movie justice does get served thanks to these passionate hardworking women. I only hope this film gets a wide release in the United States. The more people who see this film the better. 
 its great i loved it ha cause i love dinosaurs they r the greatest animals but i loved the show cause it wasn't copied from another show and it was a originals ha it has a good storyline and great for little kids (if they like dinosaurs that is) i have a few downs too its not all that great cause of the dinosaurs look a little mutated so i should have had but a 7 but right now is a little late for that yay 4 more lines to go it is great for a fantasy show though warning this might spoil a part for u so if u don't want it to be spoiled don't read on plz near the end is kinda weird cause all they need to do is get dang i forgot what it was so nvm guess its not a spoiler so never mind i loved it and its my opinion and sorry for any missed spelled words if any 
 till HBO began rerunning it this month. I remember laughing out loud in the theater back in 1991 and now again in my living room. If I see that it's on I have to watch it. There's just no question. This is so much more entertaining to me than other more popular spoofs like Airplane! (which I really like BTW). Cathy Moriarty steals the show in my opinion. Quotes like Sudden speech! The last symptoms of brain fever! She could blow at any moment! put me over the edge. And Whoopie Goldberg hasn't been this funny since 'Jumpin' Jack Flash'. Kevin Klein Sally Field Robert Downey Jr. all turn in superb performances as expected. I started out giving this 9 out of 10 stars but then I realized that for the type of film it's supposed to be there isn't one thing I'd change or improve upon. So 10 it is. I have to get this on DVD that's just all there is to it. 
 I love this episode of Columbo. Maybe it's because Ruth Gordon is in it and she is wonderful as successful mystery writer Abigail Mitchell an American version of Dame Agatha Christie. She is delicious to watch as the perky lovable author who suffered a terrible loss when her niece died in a drowning accident. She blames her niece's husband the nephew. She plans to kill him to avenge her death since the police have abandoned her. I would have loved somebody else than Mariette Hartley to play Veronica. I never really like Hartley in anything personally. And of course with Columbo there are some laughs like when he questions Veronica at a belly-dancing class. Ruth's Abigail is a smart sleuth herself and she matches wits with Columbo always played wonderfully by Peter Falk. 
 I never saw it on TV but rented the DVD through Netflix as soon as I found that it was available. I had high expectations and was not disappointed. It's funny and the animation is excellent. That level of quality I would only have expected from feature films so I'm surprised at some of the bad comments on it. Maybe the DVD release had improved animation? One bonus to the DVD is that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot. I'm an adult and I really appreciate that it is for adults. It isn't only kids who like cute animated characters. It is nowhere near raunchy as some have claimed but I can see where some parents wouldn't want their young children to see it. I'm very disappointed that it was cancelled. I wish they would produce more episodes. Or perhaps a movie. 
 From the start I knew I would be in for the best movie watching experience of my life. The idea of two giant robots manned by brilliant humans fighting each other for control of the world was the most intense and well thought of plot I have ever experienced. I can't even begin to describe the brilliant acting and well written script. Let's just just say it compares to both Lord of Rings pictures combined. The Academy had a grave oversight in not celebrating the joy that is.....ROBOT JOX. 
 I love this freekin movie! Walsh is a true master of the cinematic form his film have been sometimes in my opinion overlooked. But this film is a favourite of mine because it really gives you the feel of the time the film was set in.\ All the wonderful characters that existed the lifestyle the mode of dress the way they spoke OK they might be exaggerated but it is good to know that there were occasion when two men tried to outdo each other with insane stunts. I just felt it was apiece of history thats should be wathced by many people and appreciated because of that fact. Can I get it somewhere on DVD? I have only seen it on TV. But for anyone wanting a slice of life movie about that period of time this is the perfect one. 
 All Kira Reed fans MUST see this. The film's premise has struggling romance novelist Kira unable to come up with any new ideas. She's also getting over a divorce. However she meets this guy at a restaurant and he helps her out of her shell (and clothing). They go into a corner room and they do it. Thankfully Kira gets a condom out (Now don't ever tell me these Playboy films are worthless piles of soft-core fluff. Remember kids safe sex). Later she marvels to her publishist how great it was but she didn't get his name. Despite this the guy finds her and they continue their kinky games. But eventually she tires of his sneakiness and wants to know more. When she does all hell breaks loose and I'll leave it at that. This is easily the best of these soft-core Playboys films I've seen. Check this out and marvel at the greatness of Kira. 
 I love this movie like no other. Another time I will try to explain its virtues to the uninitiated but for the moment let me quote a few of pieces the remarkable dialogue which please remember is all tongue in cheek. Aussies and Poms will understand everyone else-well? (title song lyric) he can sink a beer he can pick a queer in his latest double-breasted Bondi gear. (another song lyric) All pommies are bastards bastards or worse and England is the a**e-hole of the universe. (during a television interview on an arty program ): Mr Mackenzie what artists have impressed you most since you've been in England? (Barry's response)Flamin' bull-artists! (while chatting up a naive young pom girl): Mr Mackenzie I suppose you have hordes of Aboriginal servants back in Australia? (Barry's response) Abos? I've never seen an Abo in me life. Mum does most of the solid yacca (ie hard work) round our place. This is just a taste of the hilarious farce of this bonser Aussie flick. If you can get a copy of it watch and enjoy. 
 Canto 1: How Kriemhild Mourned Over Siegfried and How King Attila Woos her Through his Ambassador R¨¹diger von Bechlarn: Kriemhild (Margarete Sch?n) insists on having the head of the killer of her beloved husband Hagen Tronje (Hans Adalbert Schlettow) but her brother King Gunther (Theodor Loos) refuses her request. When King Attila of the Huns woos Kriemhild through his ambassador R¨¹diger von Bechlar she makes him promise through oath in the name of his king that no man would ever offend her. Hagen Tronje hides the Nibelungen treasure in the bottom of a lake. Canto 2: How Kriemhild Takes Leave from her Homeland and How She Was Received by King Attila: Kriemhild brings some earth from where Siegfried died and travels to the court of the Huns where she is welcomed by Attila himself who also promises through oath to defend her. Canto 3: How King Attila Besieged Rome and How Kriemhild Summoned her Brothers: When Kriemhild delivers a baby boy Attila returns to his realm and asks Kriemhild what she would like most to please her. She asks him to invite her brothers to come to his kingdom. Canto 4: How Kriemhild Receives her Brothers: Kriemhild insists on having the head of Hagen Tronje but her brothers keep loyalty to their friend and again do not accept her request. Canto 5: How the Huns Celebrated the Summer Solstice With the Nibelungen: Kriemhild asks Attila to kill Hagen Tronje but he refuses since in accordance with the laws of the desert a guest is considered sacred. Kriemhild offers gold to the Hums for the head of Hagen Tronje. There is a fight and Hagen Tronje kills Attila's son. Canto 6: The Nibelungen's Distress: The Huns lose the battle against the Nibelungen but keep them under siege inside Attila's castle. Kriemhild promises to spare their lives provided they deliver Hagen Tronje but her brother Gunther tells that German people are loyal with their friends. Canto 7: The Nibelungen's End: After the death of R¨¹diger von Bechlarn Giselher and Gernot Hagen Tronje and Guhther are finally captured. Kriemhild kills Hagen Tronje ending her revenge with the destruction of the Nibelungen. The conclusion of the poetic saga of Siegfried through Kriemhild's Revenge is also told through seven dramatic cantos. The nature of the first part is a magnificent tale of fantasy adventure romance and betrayal; the second part is a dramatic story of hate revenge and loyalty. The solid screenplay with a perfect development of the characters the excellent performances of the cast and the awesome direction of Fritz Lang produced another epic ahead of time. Margarete Sch?n is impressive with a total different woman obsessed and inflexible in her revenge wish. The costumes that Kriemhild wears are also very impressive and her acting is based on her face and look. I was a little disappointed with the reaction of Attila after the death of his only son since I found it too passive. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): Os Nibelungos ? Parte II: A Vingan?a de Kriemshild ( The Nibelungen Part II: Kriemhild's Revenge ) 
 What can you possibly say about a show of this magnitude? The Sopranos has literally redefined television as we know it. It has broken all rules and set new standards for television excellence. Everything is flawless the writing directing and for me most of all the acting. Watching this show you'll find yourself realizing that these characters are NOT real. The acting tricks you into thinking there is a real Tony Soprano or any character. This show is also very versatile. Some people don't watch the show because it's violent it's not all about the violence it's about business family and many deeper things that all depend on what you as a fan see. For me I don't like when people refer to the show a show about the Mafia. For me it's a show about family. A family who through generations happen to be apart of the mob. Overall this is a masterpiece of a show. This is what television should be. Right here. Complex characters from stunning acting magnificent story lines from brilliant writing and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together? A show that defines excellence and dares to be different. 
 Eddie Izzard is nothing short of a comedic genius and this is Eddie at his very best. His material is extremely witty and hilarious and his delivery is some of the best ever witnessed on stage. Instead of insulting the audience's intelligence he relies on it to draw humor from his wardrobe preferences Hitler the moon landing and the British. With so many memorable laughs one can't help but repeat some of his lines. Forever more Do you have a flag? should be considered one of the funniest lines ever delivered in a standup routine. Every fan of top notch standup comedy needs to see Dress to Kill . By far the best British standup comedian I've ever witnessed Eddie Izzard has struggled for success off of the live stage. However his lack of commercial success in film should not be indicative of how extremely talented he genuinely is. Dress to Kill is a treasure one that luckily has found its way to home video and can and should be enjoyed again and again. 
 Wow. Uhm...well...wow! I guess I'll start with the plot. A betrothed woman (Lucy) arrives at the family home of her would be husband (Mathurin) in France where they are awaiting the arrival of the Bishop or Cardinal or someone in the Catholic Church to marry them (to satisfy a will.) While waiting young Lucy learns about a legend of a Beast who roamed the grounds centuries before. In bed that night she begins fantasizing about the Beast and his rape-turned-consensual tryst with the former lady of the house. That's where it gets interesting! The plot is really pretty thin (and it seems to drag on for quite a while in the middle of the flick) but the filmmaker rewards (?) those who stick it out with a shocking and hilarious finale. This movie isn't for everyone. If you're looking for great cinema look elsewhere. If you're looking for a far-out movie about bestiality (that almost casts a sympathetic glance over the subject) this movie is for you! (If you have a weak stomach don't be afraid of this one. Outside of some horse-on-horse action at the beginning the 'deeds' are pretty cartoonish IMO) 
 This drama is unlike Sex and the City where the women have a few drinks and share their sexual encounters with each other. Its much more personal and people can relate to it. Its much more engaging and emotional on a new level than other dramas focusing on women and their lives like Sex and the City Lipstick Jungle.... Dr. Katie Roden is a psychologist with a dark secret she seems much more depressed and guilt ridden than the rest of her 3 friends. She is dealing with the death of her former lover who was her patient while tackling his son's advances on her. Her sombre clothes and empty and cold house convey her inside emotions very well. Trudi Malloy a widow is battling issues with letting go of her dead husband from 9/11. And when a handsome stranger Richard shows an interest in her she is suddenly forced to do a reality check by her friends who suggest that she gets back into dating business. The ridiculous and embarrassing courting scenes between Richard and Trudi are totally funny! It is interesting to note that Richard asks her out the day she gets a millions from the 9/11 board for her husband's death..lets see what his intentions are Siobhan Dillon a lawyer is fed up of her husband's love making tactics which only involve baby making (as they are having trouble conceiving) and she quickly falls for her colleague who offer his services a little too willingly to her and she does not hesitate for long!It will interesting to see whether she will continue her affair or patch up with her husband (played by Raza Jeffrey) Jessica a real estate business woman is single and is straight until she organizes a lesbian wedding and has an affair with one of them. Her character is shown as a bold and provocative woman who before her lesbian encounter is having sex with a married man her colleague. Lets see where her character venture to.... The beauty of this drama is that we are shown 4 totally different women with different scenarios whose ambitions and inhibitions are shown. Its also a good thing that the drama reveals the fact that sometimes friends lie to each other to be safe ! 
 Great documentary about the lives of NY firefighters during the worst terrorist attack of all time.. That reason alone is why this should be a must see collectors item.. What shocked me was not only the attacks but the High Fat Diet and physical appearance of some of these firefighters. I think a lot of Doctors would agree with me that in the physical shape they were in some of these firefighters would NOT of made it to the 79th floor carrying over 60 lbs of gear. Having said that i now have a greater respect for firefighters and i realize becoming a firefighter is a life altering job. The French have a history of making great documentary's and that is what this is a Great Documentary..... 
 when i read other comment i decided to watch this movie... First cast specially Michael Madsen and Tamer Karadagli; good enough... Film very intelligence and interesting because cast have a lot of international specially European actor and actress like from Turkey and Russsia... Second Story is basic and you can guess but if you interesting action good play you'll like in my opinion... Third Final chapter is not special or interesting it's regular like other action movies... Finally i recommend to watch this movie...And i hope You'll love it enjoy :D 
 I enjoyed this movie. Haven't seen Andy Griffith in ages and felt he fit this role perfectly. I've associated him with comedy but am pleased to see that he's versatile. I wasn't troubled that Dotty's anxiety disorder may not have been verbatim from a psychiatric textbook. There are zillions of whatever-phobias and neuroses and these can take on a broad variety of quantitative and qualitative forms. She is clearly a sensitive with extra-sensory powers as was understood by the local Indians but not by any Anglos. It is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric. Although this is taken to be a light family movie it is actually more sophisticated than it seems. Also Hiram's twist at the end came as a pleasant surprise to me and tied all the preceding action together in a bundle. It's fun to contemplate the possibility of such spiritual guidance. 
 Cinderella is one of the most beloved of all Disney classics. And it really deserves its status. Based on the classic fairy-tale as told by Charles Perrault the film follows the trials and tribulations of Cinderella a good girl who is mistreated by her evil stepmother and equally unlikable stepsisters. When a royal ball is held and all eligible young women are invited (read: the King wants to get the Prince to marry) Cinderella is left at home whilst her stepmother takes her awful daughters with her. But there is a Fairy Godmother on hand... The story of Cinderella on its own wouldn't be able to pad out a feature so whilst generally staying true to the story otherwise the fairly incidental characters of the animals whom the Fairy Godmother uses to help get the title character to the ball become Cinderella's true sidekicks. The mice Jaq and Gus are the main sidekicks and their own nemesis being the stepmother's cat Lucifer. Their antics intertwine generally with the main fairy-tale plot and are for the most part wonderful. Admittedly the film does slow down a bit between the main introduction of the characters and shortly before the stepsisters depart for the ball but after this slowdown the film really gets going again and surprisingly (since Cinderella is the most worn down story of all time probably) ends up as one of the most involving Disney stories. The animation and art direction is lovely. All of the legendary Nine Old Men animated on this picture and Mary Blair's colour styling and concept art (she also did concept art and colour styling for Alice in Wonderland Peter Pan The Three Caballeros and many many others) manage to wiggle their way on screen. The colours and designs are lovely especially in the Fairy Godmother and ball scenes as well as in those pretty little moments here and there. Overall Cinderella ranks as one of the best Disney fairy-tales and comes recommended to young and all that embodies the Disney philosophy that dreams really can come true. 
 I appreciate movies like this: smart and well-crafted entertaining absorbing well-acted and nicely directed. Nobody -- even Pacino -- is chewing the scenery* trying to stand out; one of the film's most effective moments (Aielo pulling over at his beloved off ramp) is chilling precisely because of its restraint. Not as good as say QUIZ SHOW CITY HALL is of a similar cloth: engaging the mind as well as eye ear and heart. Why such well-hewn entertainment flops at the box office is anybody's guess. *You know Pacino does chew it up in one particular scene but precisely because it's required. Great scene too. 
 I love Tudor Chirila and maybe that's why i enjoyed the movie so much. Two days before the movie premiere I went to see his concert. I saw the trailer and the video zmeu before the movie and I thought I had it all figured.. i was wrong: instead of a good movie i assisted a great one! i FELT the movie. it was sad.. it was funny.. but most of all it pictured LOVE.. I can't even begin to describe the soundtrack.. so i won't :) I'm not a movie critic.. I can't describe it in more words.. My kinda vague description is all because the play left me speechless.. thank god for the keyboard :) Thank you Tudor Giurgiu thank you Maria Popistasu thank you Ioana Barbu and THANK YOU TUDOR CHIRILA. Encore! :) 
 I have a two year old son who suffers from the same condition as Jonny Kennedy. I never got the chance to meet him but I have never heard anybody say a bad word about him. I hope he knows how much the making of this programme has helped his fellow sufferers by raising awareness of this terrible condition. This man has touched people in a way that a million charity leaflets could not. I believe that this should be compulsory viewing in schools. I also agree with other comments - what have I got to moan about? He took everything that life could throw at him and still managed to retain a sense of humour. God Bless. I couldn't watch the part that showed his dressings being changed. I have enough trouble with my son's. 
 I spied this short on a DVD of best new Zealand shorts all great but The french Doors was amazing. It starts off slow and you wonder if there is anything going to happen. Just as you relax into the hum drum of home renovation the most spookiest thing happens. EEEEkkk I wanted to stop watching but I was glued. The films dips into the primal fear of the dark and with little if not any special effects. It chills you right to the bone. A simple yet brilliant concept opened up all those memories of when I was young and dream't up the most improbably but spooky situations. The film makers visual style are bang on and the lead character takes you convincingly through the story. It is a quality short that I haven't seen in quite some time. The French Doors has all the hallmarks of a great feature alas it finishes after ten minutes or so. Never the less a great ending that begs you to want to know more. Loved it and well done and thanks for the ride. These New Zealanders are really turning out the talent. A new fan. 
 In 1970 after a five year absence Kurosawa made what would be his first film in color. Dodes' Ka-Den is a film that centers around many intertwining stories that go on in a small Tokyo slum. The title comes from the sound a mentally retarded boy makes as he imagines he is operating a train. We slowly get to know more of the people in the small community the two drunks who trade wives because they are not happy with the ones they have. The old man who is the center of the town who helps out a burglar that tries to rob him. The very poor father and son that cannot ever afford a house so they imagine one up of their own. By the end of the film the stories all come full circle some turn out happy others sad. Since this was Kurosawa's first color film you can see that he uses it to his advantage and it shows. Maybe too much. This movie goes in many different directions and it's hard to settle down and get into it. But don't get me wrong Dodes' Ka-Den may not be Kurosawa's best but coming from the greatest director of all time it's much better than 99% of today's films. 
 Imagine if you could bring things back to life with just one touch As soon as I first heard that my attention was locked on the Trailer And after the First Episode I found my self in love with this show. A Modern day Fairy Tale that Brings my Spirits up and Holds my attention throughout the entire show. I think the Acting and Casting is just perfect Each Character brings Something Unique to the show that adds to it's perfection. Even the one time Villains manage to overflow with A Unique sense From the Bee Man to the Guy who can Swallow Kittens they never seem to let me down. And the Deaths that would Normally lead to a Depressing Moment often end up being Purely Comical (Such as an Exploding Scratch & Sniff book) Even with the large amount of Crime shows we have now a days Daisies is one of the few that really stands out from the rest Being not just a Mystery but a love story Comedy and a Fairy Tale with a hint of Drama all baked into one Wonderful pie.....err show. What really shocked me was the fact that it was on ABC For Years I never had a reason to turn to ABC But this brought me back each week with a Smile on my face. It was as if Pushing Daisies Brought ABC back to life for me. But just like that after two seasons A few Awards A Large Fan Base and Positive Responses from Critics the show has been dropped. It seems as though Ned has Touched ABC again and forever killed it for me. I will always be a fan of this show though And I Recommend this to anyone who likes a lot of talking and a lot of love from the shows they watch. 
 Hrm-I think that line was from the old movie posters. This is a dumb movie that seems to have been translated from some language that was totally unfamiliar to the translator. Here's a tip: Any movie that starts with a black screen and text reading In the future... is going to be fun. This means that the premise is so implausible that they have to explain it to you. In this case In the future... means that instead of fighting wars nations have guys climb into giant robots and duke it out to determine well that's never terribly clear but it's probably something really important. There are good guys (obviously capitalists i.e. us ) and bad guys (Commies!) and there are big stop-motion robots. Sadly the effects budget was pretty slim so we don't get to see a lot of the big robots. There are plenty of cheap looking interior scenes and then a big space fight near the end. The space fight is especially nice as it serves precisely no purpose other than the blow the remainder of the effects budget. With said money now spent the climactic fight degenerates into (and I'm not making this up) two guys hitting each other with sticks. I can always get a laugh in a bar by re-enacting the final scene complete with a last line guaranteed to leave any audience scratching their heads. Like I said-it's dumb. That's why I bought the tape. 
 Damn was that a lot to take in. I was pretty much mesmerised throughout. It was pretty perfect though I would say the editing had a lot to do with that. I can't believe this guy stayed on good terms with the lot of them (Anton especially) to get all of this footage without any serious... beef. The Dandy's did come off well-together middle-class kids who took advantage of their situation (and rightly so!). I felt bad for Jonestown and especially for Anton which maybe wasn't what a lot of other people felt. Great piece of film-making and great choice of subject(s). I recommend this to any music/film fan. You'll probably learn something about film-making. 
 at first I had the reaction a lot of people left with after seeing this: that shots of fat people sunbathing etc were cheap shots in a way. OK so he's doing diane arbus meets. . . whatever. . . but it wasn't long before I realized that this wasn't being done in a dehumanizing way as the images unfold I felt that the problem was entirely the audience's: we are conditioned by Hollywood and also movies from just about everywhere actually to feel that to watch people above a certain age behave in a sexual way is something unseemly something that ought not to be shown. if this were all the film offered it would be a great deal. however the story of the woman with the abusive boyfriend and his drunk friend really hits like a ton of bricks: very eloquent storytelling incredible performances and to think the scene was improvised. that blonde guy is a genius actor. finally I want to contradict those who say this film is all about how pathetic all these people are. the old man who is on the make with the woman who finally dances for him is completely an a OK character that breaks that mold so don't oversimplify the film by overlooking him. yes his dog gets killed. this ain't a rosy picture of the world but it's not . . . completely hopeless. anyway I felt really grateful to the filmmaker for making such a beautiful film all in all. I wouldn't say each of the threads were as strong as the strongest but I say this movie basically kicks ass and would highly recommend it. . . 
 This is one of the best episode from the second season of MOH I think Mick Garris has a problem with women... He kill'em all they are often the victims (Screwfly solution Pro-life Valerie on the stairs I don't remember the Argento's episode in season 1 etc. obviously Imprint). I think he enjoys to watch women been burn torture mutilated and I don't know. Never least Right to die is one of the best with good turns and graphic scenes and suspense (specially with the photos from the cell scene wonderful). The acting is like the entire series regular I could be worst like Pro-life or We scream for Ice cream . Also I think the plot it could be made for a movie and not just for an episode. The ideology of the series is horrible killing and terminating women mutilating animals and on and on... the first season it was better than the second one with episodes like Cigarrette burns (The best of all) Homecoming (The most funny) Imprint (really shocking). 
 Heartland was in production about the same time as Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate - Heartland cost a fraction to make but is 10 times the piece of film. Heaven's Gate was the biggest and most expensive ($40 mil in 1980!) Hollywood flops of all time its failure resulted in the sale of the United Artists studio to MGM -imdb entry Heartland cost a few hundred thousand dollars and benefits from great writing direction photography and acting. It easily draws you into the beauty joys hardships and sorrow of pioneer life. It's sad that Hollywood sometimes would pour millions into turkeys (based on a director's single big hit) and neglect such a wonderful story. 
 Dudley Moore is fantastic in this largley unknown classic. This film is very witty film that relies hugely on the actors talent. Without Dudley Moore John Gielgud Liza Minnelli and a few others this film could have been a disaster. It is not always well shot and at times has some very corny music that tries to force a mood (the psycho -like music at the wedding fight) but the acting overcomes it. The character Arthur is hilarious with his drunken comments. But he develops well into a more mature well rounded character as he learns to live by his own free will. The end is fairly corny though. I wont give it away but it could be improved. Worth seeing many times. 
 The first and only time I saw the woman in black was I think the only time to my knowledge it appeared on TV back in 1989. It was Christmas eve and my father and i were watching it in the living room shortly before we all went to a midnight service in the village church. I was quite young at the time but i'm not sure who was more terrified walking through the church yard to the entrance of the church that night me or my father!. There are many factors about this film that make it so creepy but i think 0ne of them is the fact that there's not much in the way of a sound track that plays in the background of nearly every Hollywood movie so every creak thump and bang is more amplified in your head as there's no distraction. Another factor that makes it different from other ghost stories there's no jump factor involved like things bouncing out the closet so it makes it not necessarily what you see but what you hear and what you think is going on. This is a clever medium as nothing scares you more than your own mind running riot thinking whats around the corner or behind the door! A superb ghost story I've never seen anything that can match it and with all the dross thats repeated over and over on TV i cant believe the BBC has deleted it after (to my knowledge) only one showing! 
 Terrific film with a slightly slow start - give it a chance to get cooking. Story builds in interest and complexity. Characters and story line subvert expectation and cliche at all the right moments. Superb New York City locations - gritty real - are a fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives of Sex in the City - in fact the entire film is an antidote to the HBO/Hollywood notion of New York City sex and relationships. It's a rare film that treats its characters so honestly and compassionately. LOVED IT! Great cast with notable performances by Steve Buscemi Rosario Dawson and her love interest (forgot his name!). 
 Fever Pitch is a sweet and charming addition to the small genre of sports romances as date movies or movies a son could be willing to go to with his mother (though the guys in the audience got noticeably restless during the romantic scenes). I have lived through a milder version of such a story as my first exposure to baseball was dating my husband the spring after the Mets first World Series win and then I watched the Mets clinch their next one because I was the one still up in the wee hours with our two little sons who have grown up to teach me more about baseball through our local neighborhood National League team's other heartbreaking failures to win it again (and it was me who took our older son to his only Fenway Park game as I caught a bit of Red Sox fever as a graduate student in Boston). So compared to reality the script believably creates two people with actual jobs. It is particularly impressive that Drew Barrymore's character is a substantive workaholic who has anti-Barbie skills though she pretty much only visits with her three bland girlfriends during gym workouts that allow for much jiggling and the minor side stories with her parents don't completely work. It is even set up credibly how she meets Jimmy Fallon's math teacher and how she falls for his winter guy -- though it's surprising that his Red Sox paraphernalia filled apartment didn't tip her off to his Jekyll-and-Hyde summer guy. Their relationship crisis during the baseball season is also played out in a refreshingly grown-up way from efforts at compromise to her frank challenges to him centered around that they are both facing thirty and single. Fallon surprisingly rises to his character's gradual emotional maturity. While the ending borrows heavily from O. Henry the script writers did a yeoman job of quickly incorporating the Sox's incredible 2004 season into a revised story line (with lots of cooperation from the Red Sox organization for filming at the stadium). The script goes out of its way to explain why Fallon doesn't have a Boston accent as an immigrant from New Jersey but that doesn't explain why his motley friends don't. The most authentic sounding Boston sounds come from most of his summer family of other season ticket holders who kindly kibitz the basics of Sox lore to neophyte Barrymore (and any such audience members). The song selection includes many Red Sox fans' favorites from the opening notes of the classic Dirty Water though most are held to be heard over the closing credits as if you are listening to local radio and are worth sitting through to hear. 
 When I was over at Hollywood video I looked through their clearance out movies and there was DEMONICUS for five buckaroos plus fifty percent off! I saw it only once before and couldn't pass up this great deal! The second viewing was much better than the first. The box is so cool and the music is very good. If you haven't seen Demonicus yet I recommend that you do or if you rented and hated Demonicus do give it another chance as another viewing of it may change your mind. If you seen a copy at Hollywood Video for the price I got it for don't pass it up as it is a great deal! Demonicus is well a very different but entertaining movie.Believe it or not is like watching a interactive video game with out playing it!It has very low budget and actors I'M sure that nobody is familiar with. We began the the video game uh I mean film with a guy and a woman some where in Italy and there is a cave that actually looks like a rail road/train track tunnel and she says don't go in there and what does he do?The normal stuff!HE DIDN'T LISTEN TO HER! He goes in there and find lots of gladiator artifacts and armor and a almost perfectly preserved body of a legendary gladiator named Tyrannous!Where did the chair come from that Tyrannous was sitting on and how did his body stay so good and where did the Cauldron Pot come from?So every cave is complete with a Caultron Pot?Tyrannous is wearing his armor helmet and has a weapon or two.He does the dumbest thing a person could do he puts on the helmet and is taken over by the spirit of Tyrannous! From there he walks around just killing all of the campers near by to bring back the real Tyrannous. Now I said before its like a video game.Its hard to explain but it just feels like it.The music even sounds like video games.The acting is really terrible.The actors say things like why is he doing this oh he was nuts already and Fine since he's nuts i'm going home!Also the movie also has some major errors like a guy is running and trying to find his girlfriend in the night and is still running in the day time still searching for her with out taking a break! This movie has some errors but it isn't a classic like Werewolf but it is entertaining if you like really low budget error prone movies then you better see Demonicus! 
 I watched The Babysitter as part of BCI Eclipse' Drive-in Cult Classics (featuring Crown International Pictures releases) on DVD. I think it is a very good film. This movie packs a lot of story into a very short time. You have hippies rock music bikers lesbians sexual impropriety blackmail and murder all in one spot! The lead actors do a credible job. And I found the intricately woven plot to be believable and interesting. However the supporting cast primarily the bikers delivers a stilted performance particularly when asked to deliver lines with more than just a few words. Perhaps they used real bikers instead of actors. A couple of the characters in particular were exceptionally believable. The musical score is absolutely spot-on for the times the tempo and for moving the story forward. I found the music a real treat. I noticed in the opening credits that the movie featured the music of The Food I googled them; but couldn't find anything... In any case George E. Carey who wrote produced and starred in this movie liked the idea so much (of a wayward married man brought to redemption through trials and tribulation; and a little help - of course) that he wrote produced and starred in Weekend with the Babysitter.  
 I have bought the DVD of this version to compare against the current BBC 2005 version (which is brilliant). The 1985 was adapted by Arthur Hopcraft who adapted Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy for TV and who died this year (2005). I remember great acting especially from Rigg and Elliott and moving music. (Music in the 2005 version is far more understated but very telling.) Just to pick up other commentators on a couple of points: Richard Carstone is Ada Claire's boyfriend not Esther's. Esther had no uncle. Charlie Drake never played Krook in either version nor did he play Toby Esterhase in TTSS! Krook is played by comedian Johnny Vegas in the 2005 version. Toby was played by Bernard Hepton. Both versions are honourable and admirable adaptations of Dickens' great novel. Now read the book! It's not perfect and the sentimentality may make you wince at times but I defy you not to cry - and laugh! 
 The Bill was essentially a cultural fountain from which a beautiful rainbow-haze of socio-introspection emerged inspiring such famed derivatives as Cop Land The Departed The Godfather 3 and most recently of course The Wire. With multi-faceted characters and story lines that have been described as '4-dimensional Shakespeare' The Bill grabbed you by the collars from episode one and just would not let you go. The show covered anticipated and even occasionally caused all the major global events between 1984 and 2010. The most famously prescient moment being episode 19 of series 5 which aired on the eve of the second Gulf War. Detective Jim Carver's misguided - and ultimately career ending - drugs raid on Craig 'Fun Boy' Richardson's flat in the Jasmine Allen Estate in early 2003 was widely viewed as a predictive allegory for the coalition's failure to find weapons of mass destruction following the invasion of Iraq several months later. However it was the work the Bill did to try and highlight some of the lesser-known problems experienced by police officers that won it the most praise. This was sympathetic drama covering such sensitive areas as helmet-phobia under-uniform cross-dressing in-van homosexuality lost truncheons casual drunken bestiality (regretted) siren aversion syndrome (SAS) groin chaffing caused by chasing suspects while wearing an overly starched uniform and many many more issues that still trouble disturb haunt and excite officers to this day. The last word should go to one of The Bill's most famous fans Nelson Mandela: ?it is no exaggeration to say that I would not have made it through the dark void of loneliness that summed up my last years of incarceration on Robben Island if it wasn't for the heart-warming casual buffoonery of Reg Hollis.  
 Look if I were interested in a Nancy Drew book what I would do is pick up a book and read it. I'm not. Ever since I can remember I read people trashing movies because it wasn't like the book. I'm sorry - in the digital age we can no longer watch movies on flip books however I'm sure you can still find a few short silent films in book form. When Lord of the Rings came out people complained. When the third one won an Oscar - The book was better. When I watched To Kill a Mockingbird the book was better. Now a bunch of people are upset yet again because Nancy Drew wasn't like the book. I'm not saying Nancy Drew is going to win any Oscars - if anything it'll be one of those Nickelodeon Blimps or Kids Choice Awards. I'm saying give film a break. It's film not paper. As a movie I found Nancy Drew quite enjoyable - featuring cameos from Bruce Willis and Adam Goldberg (The Hebrew Hammer) and supporting roles featuring Tate Donovan (Jimmy Cooper on the O.C.) and Rachel Leigh Cook (She's All That). This is the first time I've seen Emma Roberts in a movie and frankly I enjoy her work more than most of Julia and of Eric's; her character stays consistent throughout the film and reacts well with conflict. A lighthearted movie in the spirit of Harriet the Spy is nice now and again. I give it ten stars because I thoroughly enjoyed the movie would love to see it again and will probably buy it upon DVD release. 
 Mario Lanza of course is The Great Caruso in this 1951 film also starring Ann Blyth Dorothy Kirsten Eduard Franz and Ludwig Donath. This is a highly fictionalized biography of the legendary world-renowned tenor whose name is known even today. The film is opulently produced and the music is glorious and beautifully sung by Lanza Kirsten Judmila Novotna Blanche Thebom and other opera stars who appeared in the film. If you're a purist seeing people on stage smiling during the Sextet from Lucia will strike you as odd - even if Caruso's wife Dorothy just had a baby girl. Also it's highly unlikely that Caruso ever sang Edgardo in Lucia; the role lay too high for him. In taking dramatic license the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of Caruso's life. What was so remarkable about him is that he actually created roles in operas that are today in the standard repertoire yet this is never mentioned in the film. These roles include Maurizio in Adriana Lecouvreur and Dick Johnson in Girl of the Golden West There is a famous photo of him posing with a sheet wrapped around him like a toga. The reason for that photo? His only shirt was in the laundry. He was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long partnership with the Victor Talking-Machine Company (later RCA Victor). He was singing Jose in Carmen in San Francisco the night of the earthquake. Instead the MGM story basically has him dying on stage during a performance of Martha which never happened. He had a hemorrhage during L'Elisir d'amore at the Met and could not finish the performance; he only sang three more times at the Met his last role as Eleazar in La Juive. What killed him? The same thing that killed Valentino - peritonitis. His first role at the Met was not Radames in Aida as indicated in the film but the Duke in Rigoletto. So when it says on the screen suggested by Dorothy Caruso's biography of her husband that's what it was - suggested. What is true is that Dorothy's father disowned her after her marriage and left her $1 of his massive estate. They also did have a daughter Gloria together (who died at the age of 79 on 10/7/2007). However Caruso had four other children by a mistress before he married Dorothy. Some people say that Lanza's voice is remarkably like Caruso's but just listen to Caruso sing in the film Match Point -- Caruso's voice is remarkably unlike Lanza's. In fact from his sound had he wanted to Caruso could have sung as a baritone. He is thought to have had some trouble with high notes further evidence of baritone leanings; and the role he was preparing when he died was Othello a dramatic tenor role which Lanza definitely was not. Lanza's voice deserved not to be compared with another. He made a unique contribution to film history popularizing operatic music. He sings the music in The Great Caruso with a robust energy; he is truly here at the peak of what would be a short career. His acting is natural and genuine. Ann Blyth is lovely as Dorothy and gets to sing a little herself. Really a film for opera lovers and Lanza fans which are probably one and the same. 
 After her Oscar-nominated turn in Secrets & Lies Brenda Blethyn starred in the equally great Saving Grace . And let me tell you this is not the sort of movie that you find every day. After her husband commits suicide Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) discovers that his irresponsible financial decisions have left her with a massive debt. Fortunately she finds a way to make ends meet: marijuana. That's right Grace starts cultivating it. Every aspect of this movie was played to great effect; there isn't a dull moment anywhere in it. And I sure didn't see that end scene coming! But anyway you gotta see this movie. You just might feel more than a little festive after seeing it. If nothing else it might function as a good lesson about knowing one's finances. But of course there's a LOT more to it than that! 
 I really really love this show! I have always liked the 1990's shows of Space Ghost! This show was hilarious and I can't believe why Cartoon Network's Adult Swim would take such a funny show like this off the air. I hope they put this show on DVD or something. The show is about Brak (from the Space Ghost cartoons SGCC and Cartoon Planet) who lives his every day life with his Mom and Dad and his best friend who likes to drop in a lot Zorak! My favorite episodes were the one where Zorak gets this really good singing voice and then his voice doesn't give him any money that Zorak made from singing at all. Another episode I like is the one where Brak and Zorak didn't finish their homework and then they go back from Sunday to Friday and they just goof off and then they go back to the day homework was invented and then when they go back to the present homework didn't exist! Another episode I like is the one where Brak's Dad and their next door neighbor Thundercleese the Robot keep getting into this agrument and then they get eaten by a giant worm. Another episode I liked was the one where Zorak makes a bully stand and then some new guy took over his stand. I also like a lot of the other episodes! One thing that never fails to make me laugh is when Zorak is getting beaten up blasted and zapped! 
 Ok the film wasn't going to win any awards and it is pure bubblegum and it is a modern update on It's a wonderful life . But it's just come out as a cheap release on DVD and there are a lot worse ways of blowing $13. You get a film that has a surprisingly strong cast but for most they were still a year or two from becoming B list celebs. However it's an enjoyable way of passing an hour and half just don't think too much in it. 
 The film had many fundamental values of family and love. It expressed human emotion and was an inspiring story. The script was clear( it was very easy to understand making it perfect for children)and was enjoyable and humorous at times. There were a few charged symbols to look for. The cinematography was acceptable. There was no sense of experimentation that a lot of cinematographers have been doing today(which quiet frankly is getting a little warn out). It was plainly filmed but had a nice soft quality to it. Although editing could have been done better I thought it was a nice movie for a family to enjoy. And the organization of information was just thrown at you which was something I didn't like either but in all it was a good movie. 
 In all truth this really isn't a movie so much as an extended final episode; by this I mean that had you NOT followed the TV series (Homicide: Life On The Street) I suspect that you would have a hard time following this made-for-tv movie. Having said that Homicide: The Movie is still a great watch. I think it says a lot about a television production that EVERY single cast member would return many after years of absence to once again portray their characters and bring closure to an incredible program. The movie brings out that sense of family not only amongst the characters but amongst the actors as well. It's all very bitter-sweet knowing that this will be the LAST time we will see them all together again under the title of HOMICIDE. Story-wise I found this film somewhat lacking. Giardello's mayoral candidacy seems particularly contrived and I felt his shooting could've been dealt with within the parameters of his regular position as Leiutenant. Also Det. Bayliss's extreme plot twist which was left hanging at series end is finally resolved but I for one NEVER felt that it needed to be; I enjoyed being left with a mystery (let us recall that the very first episode's first case also went unsolved for the entire series run!). As a DEVOTED fan of the TV series I can love this movie and the fact that it even got made after H:LOTS had been canceled but I would not recommend it to anyone who hasn't had the slightest exposure to the series. Now if they'd just release it on DVD... 
 Nick and Kelly are ready to be married but Travis (Kelly's dog) leads Nick to a strange blue wall that will change the honeymoon for Kelly. Richard Burgi and Susan Walters play Nick and Kelly and make a good couple. Nick loves to drink smoke and play pool with the fellas for fun but Nick suddenly abstains from this type of fun. Sex is the one thing that he loves because he wants a child. We find out that an alien race is dying and needs to interbreed with women from Earth to save their population. It becomes a battle of survival between humans and aliens with the dog population also being involved. A fine film. 
 I studied Charlotte Bronte's novel in high school and it left me with a stunning impression. Here was a beautiful novel about a young woman's struggle to find love and acceptance in the dark times of Victorian England. This young woman was Jane Eyre a poor and plain character with a strong mind and will of her own. Her story which Bronte told through Jane's own eyes was both sad and inspiring. As part of our study we watched the 1983 adaptation of the story and it blew me away. The mini-series not only made the effort to stay true to Bronte's original text and the essence of the story but the actors who portrayed the characters were just great. Both Zelah Clarke (Jane Eyre) and Timothy Dalton (Jane's lover by the name of Rochester) captured brilliantly the essence of their characters. I cannot imagine anyone else in their roles. (The other performances of Rochester in other versions such as the 2006 version lack the passion energy and tenderness needed to portray Rochester accurately. I say that Timothy Dalton comes out on top because he possesses all these characteristics in his portrayal of Rochester. Zelah Clarke not only looks like Jane Eyre but she captures Jane's quiet but firm and passionate nature brilliantly. She holds in her emotions like the Jane of the book at the appropriate moments in the story but allows her fire to come out in Jane's passionate scenes. The chemistry that Clarke and Dalton portray in their scenes together is also credible and true to Jane and Rochester's devoted relationship.) As well the supporting actors also fit their roles perfectly and the sets fit the Gothic nature of the story. I strongly recommend this version of the classic Bronte tale. If you have not read the book before then you can watch this production as a faithful introduction to this beautiful story. 
 Since starting to read the book this movie is based on I'm having mixed feelings about the filmed result. I learned some time ago to see the movie adaptation of a book before I read the book because I found that if I read the book first I was inevitably disappointed in the film. This would undoubtedly have been true here whereas in the case of Atonement which is probably the best filmed adaptation of a book I've ever seen it would probably not have mattered. I'm trying to figure out what the cause is and I suspect that I have to point my finger squarely at Michael Cunningham. Much as I respect him for The Hours (which I have not read but which I saw and was awed by) I cannot escape the feeling that he not so much adapted Susan Minton's book as he did take a few of the characters and the basic premise and write his own movie out of it. It's not that I dislike the movie. I actually love the movie which is why since I started reading the novel I'm feeling disturbed about the whole thing. I feel disloyal to Ms. Minton for enjoying the movie which was so thooughly a departure from her work. Reading it I can understand why she had such a struggle adapting it. Unlike what one reviewer of the movie said it's not so much that some novels don't deserve to be a movie; it's more like some books just can't make the transition. Ms. Minton's novel operates on a level so personal and intimate to her central character so internally that it seems impossible to me to place it in a physical realm. Even though a lot of the book is memory of real events it is memory and so fragmented and ethereal as to be I feel not filmable. I think that Ms. Minton's work is a real work of literature but cannot make the transition to film which in no way detracts from its value. I cannot yet report that Evening the film does not represent Evening the novel in any more than the most superficial way since I'm only halfway through but the original would have to make a tremendous leap to resemble the film that follows at this point. I guess I'm writing this because I feel that if you're going to adapt a novel adapt it but don't make it something else that it's not. I'm not sure if Michael Cunningham has done anything wholly original but from what I can see so far the things he has done are all based on someone else's work. We would not have The Hours if Virginia Woolf had not written Mrs. Dalloway and we would not have Evening in its distressed form if Susan Minton had not had so much trouble doing what probably should not have been attempted in the first place. But it's too much to say that it would be better if Ms. Minton had left well enough alone because Evening the film is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its own. Thus my confusion mixed feelings sense of disloyalty and ultimate conclusion that in this case the novel cannot be the film and vice versa and my eventual gratitude to both writers for doing what they did so that we have both works as they are. 
 I thought The River of Souls was a very good Babylon 5 movie with some exceptional performances from Martin Sheen Tracy Scoggins and Ian MacShane. If this were an episode of the series (without the humour) it would probably be one of my favourite stand-alone stories of the series. Personally I've always preferred Scoggins to Christian although granted JMS didn't write her as well for much of the series and she did have to endure the Byron/Telepath plot. If you take out the smutty humour about the brothel and the poorer actors in those scenes then this movie is solid stuff. Probably my third favourite of the four movies but in no means bad at all. 
 I thought that The sentinel was going to be a mediocre movie.When I finally saw it I took a good surprise.The movie isn't great thing but it's very fun and the action scenes are very well done.This movie reminded me TV series like 24 or Alias.It's very similar to that series and it reminded me too to the Wolfgang Petersen's thriller In the line of fire.If you're going to expect one of the most original and and one of the greatest thrillers in the history of movies you will be disappointed.But if you go with little expectations you will enjoy The sentinel. Rating:7 
 Brilliant over-acting by Lesley Ann Warren. Best dramatic hobo lady I have ever seen and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none. The corn on face is a classic as good as anything in Blazing Saddles. The take on lawyers is also superb. After being accused of being a turncoat selling out his boss and being dishonest the lawyer of Pepto Bolt shrugs indifferently I'm a lawyer he says. Three funny words. Jeffrey Tambor a favorite from the later Larry Sanders show is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto. His character is more malevolent than usual. The hospital scene and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site are all-time classics. Look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting (one bleeds). This movie gets better each time I see it (which is quite often). 
 Kiera Nightly moved straight from the P&P set to this action movie... she could hardly have chosen to remake her image more dramatically. A great success in Love Actually and as Lizie in Jane Austen's classic she is once again having a go . Just as her bikini clad warrier woman in King Arthur was more skin than muscle it is difficult to imagine this delicate frame standing up to a bounty hunters life... but then this is exactly what Domino Harvey (the real one) did and I (being one of Nightly's biggest fans) believe she carries if off. Stuff.... * 90210 (for the non American world) is the post code of Beverly hills in LA where all the film stars live. * Domino Harvey father's mostfamous film was Manchurian Candidate (which appears in the film). * Domino Harvey died of a drug overdose in her bath before the film came out in June 2005 after having been arrested for drug dealing. She had just completed the negotiation for some of her music to be inlcuded in the film. * Kiera Knightly alludes to Domino Harvey's sexuality in her interview with Lucy Liu. If you find this film a bit far fetched then check out Domino Harvey as the facts are more amazing than the fiction. 
 Winchester 73 gets credit from many critics for bringing back the western after WWII. Director Anthony Mann must get a lot of credit for his excellent direction. Jimmy Stewart does an excellent job but I think Stephen McNalley and John McIntire steal the movie with their portrayal of two bad guys involved in a high stakes poker game with the treasured Winchester 73 going to the winner. This is a good script with several stories going on at the same time. Look for the first appearance of Rock Hudson as Young Bull. Thank God with in a few years we would begin to let Indians play themselves in western films. The film is in black and white and was shot in Tucson Arizona. I would not put Winchester 73 in the category of Stagecoach High Noon or Shane but it gets an above average recommendation from me. . 
 Her Deadly Rival (1995): Starring Harry Hamlin Annie Potts Lisa Zane Tommy Hinkley Susan Diol Roma Maffia Robert C. Treveiler D. L. Anderson William Blair Sean Bridges Robin Dallenbach Wilbur Fitzgerald Dale Frye Stan Kelly Deborah Hobart David Lenthall Lorri Lindberg Chuck Kinlaw Amy Parrish Melissa Suzanne McBride Ralph Wilcox Al Wiggins Jeff Sumerel Daria Sanford....Director James Hayman Screenplay Dan Vining. Actor Harry Hamlin (of LA Law fame Clash of The Titans and other films) seems perfectly cast in this Lifetime type film directed by James Hayman and released in 1995. He and his wife Lisa Rinna would later work on a film about sex addiction. Her Deadly Rival is at first glance similar to the better known Hollywood box-office hit Fatal Attraction . In Rival happily married couple Jim and Kris Lanford move into a new home in the typically beautiful suburbs. They have the seemingly perfect marriage- they are deeply in love despite a routine lifestyle. But then a mysterious admirer sets her eyes on Jim. Her identity is never revealed despite an attempt by Jim and even investigators to discover who she is. She constantly harasses Jim through phone calls and letters. His marriage nearly flounders as his wife begins to think he's having an affair and trying to cover it up. While Harry Hamlin Annie Potts and the rest of the cast - Lisa Zane Tommy Hinkley Susan Diol Roma Maffia Robert C. Treveiler D. L. Anderson William Blair- each seem to be straight out of a soap opera. But this is a very suspense-filled drama and has its good moments. There is a twist at the end. Spoiler Alert. All I have to say is her deadly rival was only herself. Based on a supposedly actual case Jim's wife Kris suffered from multiple personality disorder and that was what ruined her marriage. Even if the story is not terribly impressive even if the acting is only a step above soap opera acting this film has its moments. Especially moving are the intimate scenes between Jim and his wife and the final scene in which when Jim learns the truth he can't believe what he has just heard. The movie is probably a little too long and boring in some parts but it's the kind of TV movie that usually does well especially on Lifetime which continues to produce films of this kind of the domestic thriller type or seduction stories. Trashy but everyone likes trash. 
 Spoilers! From the very moment I saw a local film critic trash this movie in a review on the 10:00 news I wanted to see it. I don't remember who it was or which local Omaha newscast carried the review but the critic was very insistent that this film was way too sleazy for the average church-going Nebraskan. They showed a snippet from the scene where John Glover is about to kidnap Ann-Margret when she's swimming in the pool. Glover's character is commending her on how nice her body is and so forth using many words that the local station felt necessary to edit out. I was hooked. There was one problem though. I was only 13 years old at the time and I had to wait a year until it came out on cable. Let's just say it was worth the wait! If ever there was a guilty pleasure of mine this movie is it. To call this film sleazy would be a huge understatement. The film centers around a successful businessman who is blackmailed by three small time scumbags after an affair with a young woman. Roy Scheider who is as effective as ever plays the poor guy who just wanted a little fling and now finds himself at the mercy of three terrific villains. John Glover's character is one of the most memorable scumbags of all time. He's sleazy funny at times and always on the brink of doing something crazy. Then there's Robert Trebor's (nice name by the way!) character Leo who is clearly in over his head with this blackmail scheme. He is a whimpering sweating coward who runs a peep show place with live nude models. Then you have Clarence Williams III as Bobby Shy a brooding sociopath who everyone is afraid of with good reason. Who could forget the wake-up call he gives Vanity with the giant teddy bear? After dealing with the initial shock of realizing what he's up against Scheider turns the tables on these creeps and takes control of the situation that is until Glover goes after his wife! The conflict is played out brutally with virtually the entire cast getting shot raped or blown up. I don't know why I love this movie so much. It really should creep me out but it doesn't. Maybe it's because these characters are all interesting and the story takes plenty of chances that most films today would never try. It's scary to think that the adult film industry probably has more than a few characters like Glover's running around out in L.A. looking for trouble. Just thinking about his voice is enough to make me chuckle. Hey sport have a nice day! This film has plenty of shootouts cool cars great dialog (like the line in my opening statement) and decent acting. Plenty of cameos by real life porno stars. Look for Ron Jeremy frolicking around in a hot tub with two chicks in a party scene at Glover's place. Another thing I must add: How hot are the women in this film??? Wow! Travolta did right by marrying Kelly Preston. Yum! We also see Vanity get nude in a time before she became a born again Christian. And Ann-Margret. What else could you say about her except that she is the quintessential American Beauty. 9 of 10 stars. So sayeth the Hound. Added Feb 14 2008: RIP Roy Scheider! 
 Red Skelton was still another major star who made the transition from movies to television with ease. His shows certainly brought a laughter to the American households of years back. He would begin the show with an opening monologue. Afterwards we would have a variety of characters. Remember Gertrude and Heathcliff in the monologue? How can we ever forget San Fernando Red? I remember one episode where as a king Red introduced his queen by referring to her as your fatness. Go know that Red would use his comedic talents to really hide from his tragic life. He lost a son to leukemia at age 11 or so. His wife Georgia died by suicide. 
 This story is beautifully acted. It is both sad and heartwarming about a young girl's journey to discover where she has come from and where she is going. Stephanie was adopted by her mother's best friend after her mother and father were killed in a car crash and ever since she has been labeled the 'miracle baby' she is dyslexic and is finding life a bit tough. Her findings along the way affect those closest around her. Her relationship with her guardian and her guardian's ex boyfriend are handled very delicately and sensitively and the whole of the supporting cast are genuine 3 dimensional and believable. Set around a peach canning factory in small town Australia this is a warm gentle erotic film and leaves you with a pleasant feeling when the credits close. After reading some of the other rather shallow comments about Hugo Weaving I would like to add that I think he was brilliantly cast and was extremely sexy. No he is not Brad Pitt but that doesn't mean that he isn't attractive. 
 Being from a small town in Illinois myself I can instantly relate to this movie. Considering the era it was made in the townsfolk look uncomfortably like a lot of people I grew up with. Yes the plot is so-so. And yes the Acting is not going to get nominated for an Oscar anytime soon. But that isn't the point. The point is to suspend reality and just have FUN. And this movie has Fun aplenty. From the greedy uncaring banker to the well meaning but dimwitted deputy this movie was made to poke fun at the SciFi genre and small town living at it's best. Who can't smile at the sight of the Enforcer Drone or the Vern Droid? and I LOVED the FarmZoid. Wish I had one when I was growing up. Overall considering the technology they had available at the time this is a pleasant romp into one's childhood when you could sit back on a Saturday afternoon Popcorn in hand and laugh at the foibles of small town living. This is a movie I would watch again and again if for no other reason than to poke fun at myself and my small town ways. 
 This movie is full of references. Like Mad Max II The wild one and many others. The ladybug¡äs face it¡äs a clear reference (or tribute) to Peter Lorre. This movie is a masterpiece. We¡äll talk much more about in the future. 
 Arriving by boxcar in New York City the shrewd young woman with the BABY FACE begins to methodically canoodle her way to the top floors of power in a great bank. Barbara Stanwyck is fascinating as the amoral heroine of this influential pre-Code drama. Without a shred of decency or regret she coolly manipulates the removal or destruction of the men unlucky enough to find themselves in her way. A wonderful actress Stanwyck has full opportunity here to display her ample talents. Appearing quite late in the story George Brent is a welcome addition as the one fellow possibly able to handle Stanwyck; his sophisticated style of acting makes a nice counterpoint to her icy demeanor. Douglas Dumbrille Donald Cook & Henry Kolker portray a succession of her unfortunate victims. John Wayne appears for just a few scant seconds as an unsuccessful suitor for Stanwyck's affections. This would be the only time these two performers appeared together on screen. Movie mavens should recognize Nat Pendleton as a speakeasy customer and Charles Sellon & Edward Van Sloan as bank executives - all unbilled. The music heard on the soundtrack throughout the film perfectly punctuating the plot is ?Baby Face' (1926) by Benny Davis & Harry Akst and ?St. Louis Blues' (1914) by W.C. Handy. BABY FACE is a prime example of pre-Code naughtiness. In its frank & unapologetic dealing with sex it is precisely the kind of film which the implementation of the Production Code in 1934 was meant to eliminate. 
 I really liked this version of 'Vanishing Point' as opposed to the 1971 version. I found the 1971 version quite boring. If I can get up in the middle of a movie a few times(as I did with the 1971 version) than to me it is not all that great. Of course this could be due to the fact that I was only nine at the time the 1971 version was brought out. However I have seen many remakes where I have liked the original and older one better. I found that the plot of the 1997 version was more understandable and had basically kept true to the original without undermining the meaning of the 1971 version. In my opinion I felt the 1997 version had more excitement and wasn't so blase .(Boring) 
 But the fun is in the journey. I found this movie to be extremely enjoyable not only are both leads extremely easy on the eyes the humor from the supporting cast and the jokes actually made me laugh out loud several times. Yes it's predictable and yes it's a clich¨¦ romantic comedy. But the point is that it's a sweet story the message about finding your one true love also rings true in many ways. The dialog is dead-on and the acting is well done on all parts and over the top for comic effect. The Bulgari scene is worth it's weight in gold the actress there deserves honorable mention! For those that panned it for being predictable - If you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing... then you want a thriller. This is a romantic comedy... it touched my heart and made me realize that I was lucky enough to find my true love in life and it has been worth every effort along the way. Great date movie great movie for a happy cry... 
 The greatest games of Kasparov or Fischer can be a mess for a total rookie. This is a great movie. There is no special agency involved in the plot. This is the clue! This is a PRIVATE plot built as a PRIVATE enterprise. This is a self-destructive and a self organized plot. As a conclusion the scenario described the perfect professional plot: private self ?organized self-destructive with no trace at the end. Anyone can be behind the plot: a smart director with some money. All can be done just by delegation. The director must be just trigger. If the normal viewer cannot see the essence of the plot in the explicit sequences of the movie a real plot has fewer chances to be discovered. All the actors' performances are well done with some special mention for Gene Hackman and Mickey Rooney. 
 Okay the recent history of Star Trek has not been good. The Next Generation faded in its last few seasons DS9 boldly stayed where no one had stayed before and Voyager started very bad and never really lived up to its promise. So when they announced a new Star Trek series I did not have high expectations. And the first episode Broken Bow did have some problems. But overall it was solid Trek material and a good romp. I'll get the nits out of the way first. The opening theme is dull and I don't look forward to sitting through it regularly but that's what remotes are for. What was really bad was the completely gratuitous lotion rubbing scene that just about drove my wife out of the room. They need to cut that nonsense out. But the plot was strong and moved along well. The characters though still new seem to be well rounded and not always what you would expect. The Vulcans are clearly being presented very differently than before with a slightly ominous theme. I particularly liked the linguist who is the first Star Trek character to not be able to stand proud in the face of death but rather has to deal with her phobias and fears. They seemed to stay true to Trek lore something that has been a significant problem in past series though they have plenty of time to bring us things like shooting through shields the instant invention of technology that can fix anything and the inevitable plethora of time-travel stories. Anyone want to start a pool on how long before the Borg show up? All in all the series has enormous potential. They are seeing the universe with fresh eyes. We have the chance to learn how things got the way they were in the later series. How did the Klingons go from just insulting to war? How did we meet the Romulans? How did the Federation form and just who put Earth in charge. Why is the prime directive so important? If they address these things rather than spitting out time travel episodes this will be an interesting series. My favorite line: Zephram Cochran saying where no man has gone before (not no one ) 
 I just bought the DVD and i must say (after seeing Brazil and Fear an loathing in Las Vegas) Terry does it again. As well of being a fan of the Monty Python movies Terry Gilliam's genius follows through in this sci fi thriller whom Bruce Willis plays a wonderful role as James Cole and as well (perhaps my favorite character) Brad Pitt who played the insanity of Jefferey Goines. A must have for sci fi fans or movie fan of any type really because it includes suspense drama action etc. any way the plot In the future 1% of the world's population survives a disease intended to wipe out the human race which is unleashed in the past by the army of twelve monkeys . James Cole( Bruce Willis) is sent back to 1996 (which is when the virus was unleashed) to find out about the disease so scientists in his time can find a cure. Before i go further James Cole lives in an underground society and the animals rule the world on the surface due to the disease that will kill the humans. anyway when he is sent back in time he is actually sent back to 1990 where he is sent to a mental institution because of his tellings to people of the virus. During his stay he meets Jefferey Goins( Brad Pitt) who is later mostly responsible for wiping out the human race. He also meets his psychiatrist ((Madelein Stowe) who eventually teams up with Bruce to save the world ( as she sees that he is correct in his tellings) he is sent back and forth from his time to the past and eventually sent to 1996 where he then questions his own sanity but later pulls through to reveal a suspenseful end quarter of the movie and later builds up to the somewhat shocking climax where he tries to stop the man carrying the virus( not actually Brad Pitt) and is instead shot by the police as the killer gets away. 
 A Chinese scholar who criticizes harshly the arrogant nationalist warmongering policies of the ruling clique around the emperor in pre-war Japan is accused of being a 'communist' and jailed for life. His loving wife who supports totally her husband and his ideas is left alone to save her family from starvation. This movie is a huge statue erected in praise of the role of the mother in the history of mankind. Sayuri Yoshinaga is not less than sublime in the title role and it was a monumental scandal that she didn't get an Asian Oscar for the best female role in 2009. It went to a young girl with very limited acting potential. This deeply moving and most 'human' feature is a must see for all 'true children' on earth. 
 I am so upset that ABC is giving up on yet another show that has the chance to be a real winner. This show is so good the writing and storyline were great an actual original idea for a show instead of another boring reality show. The casting was spectacular! Not only were the characters and actors right on but these are a very talented set of actors. The concept and idea is really a new and cool idea for a TV show many of us share this whole idea of connections . I really love the characters of Steven Laura Whitney and Damien. But to be honest there is not one person connected to this show that I did not like even those that only were in for a few episodes (Sheri Appleby for example). The acting and characters are so easy to like and so talented!!. I wish ABC had given this show more of a chance and not interrupted the show midway Also it was not advertised enough. Truly unfair!! to everyone!!. This show showed great promise. I for one will let ABC know how I feel and will keep sending emails to keep this show alive. Please join me I know we can do it. It worked for Jerico. (By the way where is episode 13? I want that last show!). Please support this show and send emails to ABC we can do it!!! This show is well worth it!!! PETITION ONLINE TO SAVE SIX DEGREES: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html WE CAN DO IT!! SIGN THIS PETITION ASAP!!! 
 This is the kind of movie the US doesn't make. It's why people rent foreign films. It's a great story about how one person even if he is retarded can make a person find reason in an empty life. Everybody can learn from Georges. It also shows how people that are mentally challenged suffer in their life and shows them in a very realistic way (I think). As its classic in foreign films this movie has a bittersweet ending but that only makes it a better movie. 
 Hitchcock displays his already developed understanding for visuals in this early silent film. The plot of the film involving two boxers fighting over a girl is straight-forward drama without much to recommend it. Hitchcock's talent though is found in his stunning use of images. Nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols. Especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer. He slides it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement Hitch has shown us all we need to know. The boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting point-of-view shots that again prove how far ahead of his time Hitchcock was. The film also gives insight into his later treatment of women. The object of the boxers' desires is driven by money and lust not reason or love. The only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or old crones who help to destroy happy relationships. All in all the Ring is a must for anyone interested in Hitchcock's early work and his development as a visual storyteller. 
 Poor Basil Rathbone an egotistical composer who's lost his muse. He's been faking it for some time buying his lyrics and his music from various sources. Trouble is that two of the sources (Bing Crosby music) and (Mary Martin words) happen to meet and fall in love. And then they discover what they've been doing. Complications ensue but all is righted at the end. Crosby and Martin sing terrifically. Mary had signed a Paramount contract and also at the same time doubled as a regular on Crosby's Kraft Music Hall Radio Show. For reasons I don't understand movie audiences didn't take to her so she went back to Broadway and did One Touch of Venus in 1944 and stayed there. Basil Rathbone in one of the few times he played comedy does it very well. His ego is constantly being deflated by sidekick Oscar Levant and again I'm surprised they didn't do more films together. As in most of Crosby's Paramount vehicles no big production numbers but I agree with the previous reviewer about the title tune being done as an impromptu jam session in a pawn shop. Good job by all. A surprisingly original plot and great entertainment. 
 Ok after reading a couple of reviews on Atlantis: The Lost Empire I just want to clear up some misunderstanding as to it being a direct rip off from Nadia: Secret of the Blue Water. The only part that was a ripoff from Nadia is that the pendant from Nadia and the pendant from Atlantis bear so much resemblence in terms of how it's used origins and how it's created from the source of life that there's no doubt about it being copied. If you want to consider how Kida and Nadia is dressed alike then you could put that against Disney too(It was kind of wierd for Nadia and Kida to wear that bikini style clothing in an adventure sci-fi not to mention they both move in a similar style too). As an anime fan I have to agree there's some degree of copying but it's only on the minor details and even though not many of the ideas are original (like the encryption design on the wall in Laputa the ancient mask from Princess Mononoke the resemblence of the vehicles to the Garfish submarine in Nadia etc)...The plot itself I believe it's highly original and it's quite amazing that Disney can pull it off without the use of Captain Nemo(the main character in Jules Verne's 20k Leagues Under the Sea which is also the main character in Nadia). As for Mylo and Jean wearing similar style glasses...As shown in the novel Lord of the Flies glasses is a symbol of wisdom and intelligence. I think Mylo Jean the main character from Stargate and a dozen of other INTELLIGENT characters would look kind of unfit for the role if they went in without glasses. As for the submarines and how the submarines fight(with those wide blast torpedos which really resembles what Nautilius does) I want to state that it's a required element for either one if Atlantis is involved in the plot(after all it's a sunken city beneath the waters). As for the crew having some charactistical resemblence with the crew from Nautilius in Nadia it might be the artwork but I don't sense any copyright infringement there as the character's personalities were perfectly original to me. As an anime fan that rated Nadia as the #1 best anime I ever watched even now today. I do have my doubts about Atlantis when I first saw the preview. But now that I watched the movie I once again regained my confidence with Disney and have high hopes for their future movies after Atlantis. Overall the best Disney movie yet without me shivering at the sound of their songs at the middle of the movie and it's a plus that they revised their cheesy scripts to make it even better. Also it's amazing that they actually portray the bad guys look normal with out making them overly evil in the beginning (I was wondering who the bad guys are and only the blonde girl kind of resemble the looks of a bad character in terms of how Disney draws it aka make the bad guys look really menacing) 
 For me too this Christmas special is one that I remember very fondly. In 1989 I snatched up the 2 CDs I found of the soundtrack recording giving one to my sister and keeping the other for myself. It's part of my family's Christmas tradition now and I would love to be able to actually see the show again rather than just remember it as I listen. It has been noted elsewhere that John Denver made a number of appearances on the Muppet Show and they did more than one special together. The good rapport between Denver and his fuzzy companions comes through clearly here in a charming and fun show that is good for all ages. 
 If you loved Long Way Round you will enjoy this nearly as much. It is educational funny interesting and tense. Charley shares the screen with two interesting teammates two tired mechanics two excellent cameramen and too much Russ. Ewan makes a few appearances but Charley really pulls it off alone. He is funny engaging and still a puddle of stress and doubt. Great stuff! The series wraps up in 7 episodes. Like LWR the preparation is nearly as interesting as the race. Though they cover the ins and outs of the race well there could be a bit more explanation of the trucks and cars which are merely mentioned and rarely even seen racing. It is a motorcycle movie though and anyone on two wheels will love this. The series features stunning photography as well as a few interviews of peoples mouths. Yikes. There is another extremely catchy theme song like LWR but this one is not nearly as good as the Stereophonics. If you live in the US god knows when it will be released so buy it on Amazon.uk and watch it on your computer as I did. Oh and be prepared to buy another motorbike. 
 How truly friendly charming and cordial is this unpretentious old serial; I rejoiced in seeing old Lugosi. It is disarmingly friendly and lively. It's the document of a long?lost craft. (The best TV series today can hardly compete with these old moderately good serials.) CHANDU is deeply deeply optimistic and hedonistic . It refreshes the mind. It's not stupid; stupid are those who do not get the terms on which such serials work. CHANDU has an irresistible sense of simple unpretentious and friendly fun. Without giving away too much?Chandu is an Occidental sorcerer who goes also by this Eastern name and who also loves and protects his niece against a sect of killers. Chandu exerts his supernatural gifts in a rather discreet and moderate way. As to the quite sexy niece Nadji she is kidnapped by the priest of Ubasti: the sordid Vindhyan. The poor sexy girl is in fact multiply kidnapped?in a sarcophagus after being sent asleep with a flower; almost kidnapped from a boat; by a phony policeman; the temple of Lemuria and its strange creepy ceremonies resemble the KING KONG imagery?and are a barbaric mockery of the RCC ceremonies and rituals. Would you protect a girl as bravely as Chandu does? Lugosi looked like an old libidinous and quite heartless mean drunk and this only contributed to his performances. He is the prototypical mean drunk uncle mischievous and cunning and oblique. This might sound like a rather crooked homage to Lugosi?yet Burton's biopic of Wood left me this impression about Lugosi and allied to it a strong sympathy for the decrepit actor. I enjoy Lugosi' fancy performances. This serial is unjustly bashed. 
 First of all 'St. Ives' the film is only fairly loosely based on the Robert Louis Stevenson story of the same name but for once this is not a criticism. The original novel was a work-in-progress unfinished at the author's death and in freely adapting it and giving it an ending the film-makers have brought to life some endearing characters who although different from Stevenson's originals would I am sure have charmed and amused him. It is 1813: Capitaine Jacques de K¨¦roual de Saint-Yves is a Breton aristocrat orphaned by the Revolution's guillotine now serving as a hussar in Napoleon's army. We meet him going out for the evening claiming that since a hussar who is not dead by 30 is a blackguard he at 34 is now on borrowed time ! Certainly as he faces a string of challenges to duels our dashing hero seems in danger but a surreal prank on his Colonel provides him a way out of the duels and into the bed of a beautiful courtesan/singer. Unfortunately it also results in losing his commission... Further misadventures result in him being taken prisoner by the British and sent to a POW camp in a Scottish castle. While carving toys and boxes Jacques catches the attention of Flora the young niece of Miss Susan Gilchrist a well-travelled woman of the world who lives at Swanston Cottage. They fall in love and most of the story concerns Flora helping Jacques to escape and to find his emigr¨¦ grandfather the old Comte. Of course there is a problem. Jacques' older brother Alain a dissolute alcoholic is - perhaps understandably - far from pleased when Grandfather disinherits him in front of the whole household the very instant that Jacques has appeared... Cue treachery! There is also an entertaining subplot of the romance between the awkward na?f but good-hearted Major Farquhar Chevening and Aunt Susan who has travelled through most of the Ottoman Empire and been a prisoner of the Turks. Even allowing for a natural prejudice in favour of any film in which the heroines share my surname 'St. Ives' is magic! It combines splendidly swashbuckling swordfights a balloon-flight comedy and romantic adventure. I would recommend it to anyone who loves 'the kind of film they don't make anymore' - Fairbanks Colman Flynn & co. The acting is splendid. Anna Friel makes Flora a spirited and appealing heroine and Jean-Marc Barr is delightful as Jacques a genuinely lovable hero. Miranda Richardson and Richard E. Grant are already great favourites of mine and have great fun as Susan and Farquhar whose relationship runs as a comic counterpoint to that of the leads. As the rakish scheming but ultimately tragic Alain Jason Isaacs shows as he did more recently in 'The Patriot' that he has the classic swashbuckling style besides the dashing good looks! Please please will someone cast him as a *hero* in the genre?!!! My main quibbles with the film concern settings and costumes. In the book the castle in which Jacques is a prisoner is clearly Edinburgh but the film shot in Ireland Germany and France has 'Highlandised' the setting making the retention of place names such as Swanston Inveresk and Queensferry decidedly incongruous. The costumes too are a real hotch-potch from 1780s through to the period in which it is set. While this would not be implausible with more down-market characters making do it seems odd for well-to-do ladies such as the heroines to be wearing 1780s gowns in 1813. Clearly the costuming decision was ?sthetic: these earlier styles are visually far more appealing and elegant than Regency fashions and they work in the idealised world of the film. As a whole 'St. Ives' is 90 minutes of pure delight. 
 This obscure de Sica delivers the goods. And it is said the meek shall inherit the earth. This tale of classes on the surface but really an allegory for all the homeless people that populated Europe after the great war. They are homeless but cheerful in a societies too impoverished and selfish to care for or acknowledge them footmats for the Italian carpetbaggers. de Sica chooses to tell it as a fairy tale a Cinderella story. I have not read the book it is based on so I cannot foresay if the deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or Vittorio. It begins with the words Once upon a time... to exemplify the timelessness of its tale for the story could be set anywhere and everywhere. Caricature sketches of the aristocracy that cut to the bone whimsical nature of the homeless especially when they begin to grant their wishes and an ending right out of a Spielberg picture makes this boulange a delight for all. De Sica's most accessible picture is also one of his best. Abandoning neo-realism he always dallied between that and pure good old film-making he creates a movie that breaks the heart and at the same time fills it with the yearning of hope that one needs to continue leaving in this world. Gracias Vittorio! Gracias! Gracias!!! Gracias!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 One of THE comedies of the 1970's. Also has the best signature tune of any comedy show. The story is about three people sharing a flat living above their landlords George and Mildred. The comedy rests on the mix of the people sharing. A man and two women. Richard O' Sullivan is besotted with Paula Wilcox. Its played in a gentle and not a leering way which is why this show was such a success. The scripts and the stars were always giving the best performances and Richard's frustrated love life was shown with a relaxed charm. The end titles contained visual jokes which went unnoticed in the early 1970's but concerned the flat sharers living arrangements. 
 Moonwalker is a Fantasy Music film staring Michael Jackson with different segments. I will rate each segment individually. Segment 1 opens the film with a Music video. The Music video is a concert of Michael Jackson performing the song Man in the Mirror the Music video also show's montages of historical figures such as Gandhi Martin Luther king JR John Lennon and more. The first segment was a good choice to open the film i liked the song and also loved the montage of the historical figures. I even loved the message in the song. I give the first segment a 9/10. Segment 2 shows a montage of Michael Jackson's start from the Jackson five to his solo career. The montage i thought was well made i liked the animation they put into it and i also loved their choices of songs such as I I want you back Beat it Thriller can you feel it and the way you make me feel. The only thing i wish they could have done a little a better in one of the songs in the montage is We are the world . The reason why is all you see is rain drops and in those drops are images of Michael Jackson and the chorus of the celebrities but it's a little hard to see the chorus. Other than that the segment is still good. I give it a 9/10 Segment 3 is the song Bad. You're probably thinking it's Michael Jackson's Music video of bad Well yes and no. This segment is the Music video but it's redone by Kids. The segment was cute but it wasn't as good as the other segments. I give it a 6/10 Segment 4 is a short Claymation Music film that takes place after the kid's version of bad called Speed Demon . The short is about Michael Jackson being chased by his beloved fans and the press and he disguises himself as a rabbit and rides a motorcycle to try to get away from them. The claymation in the chase sequence was great but some parts in the film the Claymation characters looked a little fake when they interact with real people. Also at the end of the clip out of nowhere Michael Jackson rabbit costume comes to life and he's dancing with it. I liked the dancing but that was like out of nowhere. I give it a 8/10 Segment 5 is Michael Jackson's Grammy winning Music video Leave me alone. The Music Video is about the media poking their nose at Michael Jackson's personal life and Michael Jackson feels they won't leave him alone no matter how much he's proved innocent. The music video really speaks out( but keep in mind this happened before the child molestation this just all about the rumors of him in the 80's.) but i didn't feel this Video should be in this Movie because it's a kids Movie and i don't think kid's will understand what he's singing about. I give this Music video 8/10 Segment 6 leads us to the main story of the whole movie called Smooth Criminal. Michael Jackson plays a gangster who uses his powers of a wishing star as a crime figure to protect children ( including John Lennon's son Sean Lennon) from an Evil Mobster named Mr Bigg (Played by Joe Pesci). The segment i thought really brought out the film especially when he danced and sang the song Smooth Criminal with a bunch of Criminals. I also thought the special effects were good. The weird thing about the Segment is why are kids hanging out with a grown man it never explained why. Also Joe Pesci character talks about Drugs and what he plans to do with them. I mean why would you talk about drugs in a kids film. Other wise it was good. My rating for this segment is a 8/10 Segment 7 is the final segment of the whole movie. The film end's with Michael Jackson singing a Cover version of the Beatle's Song Come Together and then during the credit's we see Michael Jackson singing with Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Michael did a good cover of Come Together and i think it was good idea putting including a group of good singer's with a talented musican like him. My rating is 9/10 This movie is a good Michael Jackson film i think it really brings out children s Imagination. The film is almost as Imaginative as the Beatles animated movie Yellow Submarine if you like Michael Jackson and you're up to a film with a lot of creativity this is the film. My Overall rating for this movie is 8/10 
 I have a lot of time for all the Columbo films but this one in particular was extremely well written and the solution at the end very effective. However my main memory of this one is the opening of a scene in the middle of the film between Columbo and the murderer (I apologise if I've not remembered every detail of this exactly). It's the most striking image of Columbo I've seen: the view is from inside the darkness of the cupboard where the victim was murdered and into the room beyond which is lit up by daylight. Columbo is sitting in a high-backed armchair facing the doorway (and us) contemplating the cupboard and almost in silhouette due to the contrast in light. There's no sound. The camera slowly moves out of the room and up towards him. He's deep in meditation puffing gently on a cigar swirls of smoke from the cigar circling slowly upwards as he thinks. Then the dialogue starts. Superb. 
 The visuals and effects are up to par with the the original film and provide a lot of entertainment even if the storyline is essentially the same as the first two films. It also seems a lot more erotically charged than I remember the other films being. If you're a big fan of flying prehensile hair and tongues that can reach all the way down into your stomach you'll like this film. 
 The first thing I thought after watching Mystery Men was how could this movie be so unpopular? I found this movie so adorable and funny that it's status as a bomb defies logic. Well I hope that in the future it becomes a cult hit and you can count me amoung it's fans. Simply put and without giving too much away this movie does for comic books what the Princess Bride did for fairy tales and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? did for classic cartoons. That should give you a more accurate idea of the tone of the movie then the marketing commitee it was unfortunately signed to (this is one of those cases like the Iron Giant where the studio had no clue what it had on it's hands). Rent it the next time you're in the mood for something a little offbeat. You won't listen to the BeeGees in the same light ever again. 
 Having read Diamond's book I was slightly disappointed in the series but all in all it is quite informative. Reading the other comments it is comforting to know that the 'culture warriors' are hard at work seeing 'attacks' on 'Western Civilization' under every rug. Is Diamond a little preachy ? Sure. Like a lot of academics he sees his theory as the most important thing ever. He uses the phrase 'guns germs and steel' at seemingly every opportunity during the series. We get it after about the first 10 minutes. Is Diamond a little simplistic (in the series) ? Sure. The part about the Spaniards in South America is particularly amusing condensing some very long complicated history down to 'smallpox swords and horses' wrapping up the whole conquest of South America in about 15 minutes. But the point remains valid - these things did in fact contribute (but not totally define) the reasons for the Spaniard's success against the established cultures. Is he preaching *against* Western Civilization in any way ? Nope. Not a word. Not to my ear. All he says is that luck played a large part in determining which cultures advanced more quickly *not* that luck is the only reason. In the end if you're looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority then this series is not for you. But if you are interested in all of the factors than influence how societies succeed or fail this series presents a useful interpretation of the historical evidence. 
 Yeah it's a chick flick and it moves kinda slow but it's actually pretty good - and I consider myself a manly man. You gotta love Judy Davis no matter what she's in and the girl who plays her daughter gives a natural convincing performance. The scenery of the small coastal summer spot is beautiful and plays well with the major theme of the movie. The unknown (at least unknown to me) actors and actresses lend a realism to the movie that draws you in and keeps your attention. Overall I give it an 8/10. Go see it. 
 Contrary to popular belief this title to me at least is not so very bad. In fact. I regard it as a favoured film of all time. The welding of stories wasn't structured too well when you consider the differences between the series however despite all this you can watch it quite happily. For a feature film of its day the scenes are well proportioned and the characters remain consistently believable. The sound/audio track is a personal favourite of mine. Nearly everything has a correct sound effect and many of the voices suit the characters much better than their now badly cast US dub counterparts. The sync is perfect in every shot. I had a few issues with the casting for the 'alien' voices (please forgive the crude naming it has been a while since i've seen it). Otherwise however the cast seemed perfectly balanced. I feel and believe in the characters of this movie. Dubs are often a subject i rarely agree with from so long ago. I loved the OSD's from back then but the castings often let series down. At this point i would like to add that this was one of the first anime i saw in my life. It has historical value to me but even after seeing the original Megazone 23 it remained stronger and more watched in my collection. To my knowledge the title only ever made it to the US in Texas. Personally i think its a big shame. Had the correct audience been subject to it i think Robotech the Movie would have been accepted and not tarnished over the years. I am involved with anime each day of my life and everyone i have shown this movie thought it was a nicely put together title. Watching the film after its separate components will allow the viewer to notice the evident plot holes between shows. However without seeing the originals a viewer wouldn't really notice. Since the animation is identical in style there was no reason to question it back in its day. The UK had very limited access to anime. Laser discs were the most productive media. Personally i like the way Carl had the balls to at least push the genre. I mean Harmony wasn't going to put up the cash for the series to get publicised. Despite the few picky faults people have had with this film The eighties feel of it keeps me in love. If you watch Megazone 23 now to its original Japanese audio or the new dub i believe you will be greatly disappointed with the OSD. Cast your minds back to the original Bubblegum Crisis Dub soundtrack and imagine new eighties audio to E.V.E. Saying all this. This film's popularity nowadays is most likely down to its rarity on the open market. Personally it spawned a collection for me. I'm now scouring the world for merchandise from the three components that made it up and if i ever get to meet Carl Macek ill shake his hand for the effort and buy him a pint or a crate for getting me into anime. 
 Zentropa has much in common with The Third Man another noir-like film set among the rubble of postwar Europe. Like TTM there is much inventive camera work. There is an innocent American who gets emotionally involved with a woman he doesn't really understand and whose naivety is all the more striking in contrast with the natives. But I'd have to say that The Third Man has a more well-crafted storyline. Zentropa is a bit disjointed in this respect. Perhaps this is intentional: it is presented as a dream/nightmare and making it too coherent would spoil the effect. This movie is unrelentingly grim-- noir in more than one sense; one never sees the sun shine. Grim but intriguing and frightening. 
 Playwright Sidney Bruhl (a wonderfully over-the-top Michael Caine) would kill for a hit play. Enter young wonder kid (a solid Reeve) who's just written such a play. Weave into this Bruhl's overly hysterical wife (superbly played by Cannon) and a German psychic (a very funny Irene Worth) and you've got yourself a wonderfully funny suspense flick. While not up to Sleuth standards Deathtrap is none the less a very capable twist filled comical suspense ride based on a terrific play by Ira Levin. The performers are obviously having a field day with the material with Caine in particular delivering top notch lines with gusto. The film loses a bit of steam midway through and the ending is a lot less satisfying than the hilarious one in the original play but overall Deathtrap is solid well acted and suspenseful fun. 
 After too many years of waiting Anne Rivers Siddons' noted 1979 book The House Next Door has finally been filmed. The result veers a bit from the novel which especially in the first story of the trilogy is understandable if unsatisfying as it's a TV film the whole of which is absorbing and actually very good just not as great as the book one of Stephen King's favorites and one of mine as well. With more running time and fewer constraints as a theatrical release all the richness inherent in the original three-part story of the ominous ultramodern house could have been explored and nurtured especially the climactic revelation near the very end. Still the whole cast does well in this thoughtful tale of mindless malevolence. There are a few unnecessary cheap shocks but the growing atmosphere of dread is well developed. Actually one of the most disturbing scenes involves an abstract painting of the house by its next-door amateur-artist neighbor who is trying to visualize its corruption on canvas. Be sure to read the great novel. 
 Shrek anyone? Well imagine Shrek in the ice age. Remember the ending of Shrek? Of cause you do. Now imagine that Shrek turns into a human and so does the princess. Get it? Nice animation actually much more of an art work than Pixar and Disney pictures which are trying to get as close to reality as possible in their drawings. Strong one-liners some social comments that kids won't understand the good guys win. One thing more: Scrat. By the way how does everybody know his name is Scrat? 7/10 
 I gave this film 10 not because it is a superbly consistent movie but for it's pure ability to evoke emotions in its audience. The story of one-woman's-struggle-against-all-odds is an old clich¨¦ by now but very few films have carried it off with so much warmth and sincerity as The Color Purple. It also showed a different side to the African-American experience - showing that after slaves were granted freedom many fell into the ways of the hated 'white man' and were abusive of their own people. I find this an important point as it goes against the portray-white-on-black-violence-and-win-an-Oscar trend. Also the acting performances are superb - especially Oprah who I now have a new found respect for. Well worth watching - but keep some tissue handy. 
 Normally I don't like series at all. They're all to predictable and they tend to become boring and dull very fast. These series however are well played the story follows through all episodes and even if you miss one the story will still be catching your mind. The episodes are all filmed on a hospital and takes you further and further in to the mysteries of dark and old secrets that lies just beneath the surface of the mighty hospital. 
 Radiofreccia is a movie about all of us about our dreams our friends our obsessions our addictions our fears. It is a brilliant movie where a group of friends like all of us have lives through the hardships of growing up in a small town in one of the most significant decades in the last century. The movie doesn't take a happy or sad approach on things it just tells us a story one that all of us could have experienced. One of happiness and excitement sadness and grief. The power of this story is in that we grow to love the characters it is one of those movies you will watch over and over again feeling closer to the little town in Emilia Romagna where it takes place. Hoping one day to be able to finally walk its streets next to Freccia and his friends listening to the music that changed the world through the crackling sound of an old radio playing Radio Raptus International playing their dreams our dreams. Radiofreccia will make you laugh it will make you cry at times it will shock you and comfort you it will give you and take from you. Personally I believe it to have played an important part in my life and that of my friends and I suggest you all watch it and let it become part of yours. 
 So-so thriller starring Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis who join David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes on a road trip out west. The latter couple are researching notorious murder sites for an upcoming book; Pitt's a serial killer on the lam (unbeknownst to Dave) and Juliette is his poor not-all-there companion. This is a good cast and the story moves along but Pitt isn't belivably scary as a serial killer although it is one of his better earlier roles. The best thing is here is Michelle Forbes who always manages to shine whether in her roles on `Homicide: Life on the Street' or in the brief series `Wonderland.' Vote: 6 
 Hi my name is Jessica i'm Italian! Some time ago I have seen this film : ' For the very first time' with Corin Corky Nemec. It was the story of Micheal and Mary Margaret. I need to know the title of the song of the most important love scene in Micheal's bedroom. In Italy this film hasn't been programmed for many years and I don't know how to find the song. A lot of thanks for who can help me! I love this film! Is Very romantic! The soundtrack is beautiful! I love Cheryl Pollack! Jessica 
 This film is an hour or so of good entertainment and has some genuinely funny moments. I loved the character of Matt and also Tiny. They seemed the most engaging and funny characters and certainly the most interesting. Matt is very good (as is his no good cousin) and the police woman and the blonde biker woman provide some welcome eye candy. I must say I saw striking similarities between Matt and another Aussie actor Eric Bana. My personal favourite part was the brothel scene loved that. Overall I liked the film and it'll get about an 8 rating. The penalty however I was disappointed in. It was a side foot curl rather than the appropriate laces blast. I am of course kidding. :) 
 Kurosawa fresh into color losses sight of his usual themes of truth and perception of reality and opts for a depressing take on Tokyo's slums. Kurosawa stretches for a style that was in my opinion his antithesis- that is to say I feel as if Kurosawa wanted to make an Ozu picture. Poorly paced poorly conceived this movie is a rare dud in this auteur body of excellent work. While Ikiru while being mundane and depressing was still interesting and well paced and while Stray Dog depicted the slums and social poverty of Japan without being too heavy handed or boring do desu ka den has all the somberness that one could expect with its content with none of the redeeming qualities of earlier Kurosawa pictures. Be warned this is not a movie that Kurosawa should be judged by. 
 The most bizarre of the cinematic sub-genres is the so called The Great Ladies of the Grand Guignol : camp horror films which combined over-the-top melodrama with gothic thrills and always starred by seasoned and almost forgotten actress from hollywood golden age in unflattering roles of either long suffering victims or screeching evil harpies. This genre provided them with an unusual acting showcase that allowed strut their stuff on the screen once again and win new generations of fans at expense of their glamorous images from yesterday. What's the matter with Helen is the last drop of this sub-genre with stunning performances of both Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters as the troubled mothers of two convicted criminals who run away from their past to the sunny California in the 1930s to open a talent school to milk out the eagerly mothers who want their daughters to be the next Shirley Temple. In California Debbie gets happiness clients tango tap dancing and a new love interest (Dennis Weaver meanwhile Shelley gets wacko with horrible flashbacks menacing anonymous calls menacing strangers menacing Agnes Moorehead as a radio evangelist cute little rabbits (!) and an unfortunate encounter with an electric fan (ouch!). The sloppy script (penned by Henry Farrell the man who started all this genre with Whatever Happened to Baby Jane along with master director Robert Aldrich Joan Crawford and Bette Davis) is full of plot holes red herrings and wasted opportunities that could had made this movie great: the underlying themes of twisted motherhood (with Debbie and Shelley's characters as failed mothers and the overbearing mommies of the child stars) and obsessive female bonding (Debbie and Shelley relationship and the fact that the few male characters of this movie are either sinister or sleazy even Dennis Weaver dream boat Texan) are wasted. Instead we get Debbie Reynolds musicals interludes and dancing tots although fun to watch take too much screen time of what is supposedly to be a psychological chiller. But still this movie is highly entertaining. The two stars and Curtis Harrington stylish direction easily overcomes its flaws. The movie recreation of the 1930's is colorful and elegant (look at Debbie's clothes!) made with a very tight budget. The increasing atmosphere of madness and hysteria is genuinely creepy with a shocking finale that will haunt you for days. And you wouldn't easily forget that silly Goody goody song that runs through the movie either. And seeing an increasingly mad Shelley Winters screw every one of Debbie Reynolds' chances at happiness is a hoot to watch! 8 out of 10. 
 I liked this movie very much. Although this movie doesn't boast of big (or even known) names its very charming. Its one of those feel good types where you know that everythings gonna be just fine in the end. My favorite scene is with the baby elephant part. I rate this movie at 7.5 
 This early Anime movie was a rather good film that I caught once on the Science Fiction channel when Anime was actually popular here in America and not the ratings disaster that adult swim claims it is on the cartoon network. I quite frankly think it has less to do with it being less popular and more with the fact people would rather now buy dvds are watch the episodes uncut on the internet. This film though probably did not have all that many cuts and the voice work was okay for a dubbed movie though I would rather watch the original Japanese version. Americans tend to use some rather annoying voices for children in anything dubbed. This film features a young boy who boards a train called the Galaxy Express in the hopes that he can make it to a planet that has the technology to turn him into a robot. He wishes to become a robot to avenge his mother who was brutally murdered at the hands of a robot who hunts humans for fun. During the course of his adventures he becomes friends with the various workers aboard the train as well as a woman that resembles his deceased mother a beautiful woman named Matel who as with most woman in Anime movies has a secret that could either be really good for our young hero or really bad. He goes from planet to planet too as the train makes various stops and he runs into a space pirate named Captain Harlock who apparently starred in his own animated cartoon series so basically the Galaxy Express takes place in that universe. All in all a very good ride with a rather strange and unexpected ending. There would be a sequel to this one but it was not quite as good as this one however the ending was a bit more final than it was here. 
 Armageddon PPV The last PPV of 2006 Smackdown brand. Match Results Ahead******** We are starting the show with The Inferno match. Kane v. MVP. This was an okay match. Nothing about wrestling here. This was about the visuals. Overall this was not bad. There were a few close spots here with Kane getting too close to the fire but in the end Kane won with ramming MVP into the fire back first. Nice opener. Let's continue. Teddy Long announces a new match for the tag team titles: London and Kendrick will defend against: Regal and Taylor The Hardyz and MNM IN A LADDER MATCH!!!! Let's get moving! Match two: Fatal four way ladder match. This was total carnage. Judging by three out of the four teams here you would expect chaos. The spots were amazing. A total spot-fest. One point Jeff went for Poetry in Motion and London moved and Jeff hit the ladder! Shortly afterword Jeff is set on the top rope with two ladders nearby as MNM were going to kill Jeff Matt makes the save and Jeff hits the see-saw shot to Joey Mercury! Mercury is hurt. His eye is shut quickly and is busted open hard way. Mercury is taken out of the match and Nitro is still there. He is going to fight alone for the titles! Regal and Taylor then grab London and suplex him face-first into the ladder! Jeff climbs the ladder and Nitro in a killer spot dropkicks through the ladder to nail Jeff! Awesome! In the end London and Kendrick retain the tag team titles. What a match!!! This was insane. I can't figure out why WWE did not announce this till now. The Buyrate would increase huge. I'm sure the replay value will be good though. Mercury has suffered a shattered nose and lacerations to the eye. He is at the hospital now. Get well kid. No way anything else here will top that. Next up: The Miz v. Boogeyman.(Ugh) This was a nothing match. Will the Boogeyman ever wrestle? The Miz sucks too. After a insane crowd this kills them dead. DUD. Chris Benoit v. Chavo. This was a strong match. I enjoyed it. Chavo hit a killer superplex at one point! Benoit hit EIGHT German suplexes too! Benoit wins with the sharpshooter. Good stuff. Helms v. Yang-Cruiserweight title championship match. This was a good match. Unfortunately the stupid fans did not care for this. WHY? Helms and Yang are very talented and wrestled well. I agree with JBL. He ranted to the crowd. JBL is 100% correct. Learn to appreciate this or get out. Mr. Kennedy v. The Undertaker-Last Ride match. Not too much here. This was a slug fest with a few exceptions. Kennedy at one point tossed Taker off the top of the stage to the floor. The spot was fine. Reaction was disappointing. The end spot was Taker tomb-stoned Kennedy on the hearse and won the match. Unreal. Kennedy needed this win. They both worker hard. Still Kennedy needed this win. Undertaker should have lost. Creative screwed up again. A stupid diva thing is next. I like women. Not this. At least Torrie was not here. That's refreshing. Judging from the crowd Layla should have won. The WWE wanted Ashley. Consider this your bathroom break. Next. Main Event: Cena & Batista v. Finlay & Booker T. This was also a nothing match. The focus was Cena v. Finlay and Batista v. Booker. Batista and Booker can't work well together. Finlay tries to make Cena look good. The finish was botched. Finlay hit Batista's knee with a chair shot and Batista no-sold the shot and finished the match. Lame. Not main event caliber at all. Overall Armageddon would have scored less but the ladder match WAS the main event here. That was enough money's worth right there. A few others were solid. The Last Word: A good PPV with the ladder match being the savior. Smackdown is not a bad show just is not compelling enough. Smackdown needs to stop letting Cena tag along. Let Smackdown stand on their own two legs. This show proves that Smackdown can. 
 This is a brilliant sci-fi movie that is very strange in how men and women both view the same film. I have talked to many people about the film and almost every guy loved it and said it was brilliant--while most women thought it was just disgusting and stupid! This is the only movie I know of that has such polarized views based on gender. Perhaps many women just have a lower tolerance for disgusting or depressing plots--but whatever the cause I have always found this difference fascinating. The film begins with a murder and a subsequent investigation headed by Charlton Heston. This is set in the near future and the head of the huge international Soylent Corporation has been assassinated. As the film unfolds you quickly realize this is a terrible and highly inequitable future American society. The rich live in gorgeous apartments with security and all the pleasures money can buy(including furniture --a euphemism for paid mistresses that come along with the apartment). At the same time the masses are dirt poor unemployed and in many cases living in abandoned cars or apartment hallways. Overpopulation and smog have taken a severe toll and the future looks awful indeed! Why the rich man died and the awful truth he could not live with I really should NOT discuss--it could ruin the film for you. However the film has a great plot and acting and is super-exciting to watch. Plus it features Edward G. Robinson in his final screen performance as the crusty sidekick to Heston. Though not for the easily depressed or squeamish this is a great sci-fi film that is allegorical and profound. 
 This is an early film Pilot for the hit Canadian tv show Trailer Park Boys. It was played to executives at a few networks before Showcase decided to sign them up for a tv series. Great acting and a very funny cast make this one of the best cult comedy films. The movie plot is that these two small time criminals go around exterminating peoples pets for money. If you have a dog next door whos barking all night these are the guys you go to! But they get into trouble when they come across a job too big for them to deal with and end up in a shootout. Watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the tv series. I highly recommend it! Rated R for swearing violence and drug use. Its not too offensive either (they dont actually show killing animals) 
 The father of the Who's alcoholic drummer Keith Moon was named Arthur. I found so many similarities between Dudley Moore and Keith Moon in this movie. Liza Minelli who usually OVERACTS did quite a good job in this one and was able to turn cheek on Dudley Moore in every turn. Yes I agree Sir John stole absolutely every scene. It was a very different movie enabling the viewer to have a glimpse into another life. We often try to catch a rerun of this movie on satellite. God rest Dudley Moore; this was such an enjoyable movie. Much satire and thumbs down to the rich and snobby/affluent. The close friendship between Moore and Sir John is rather endearing. 
 When will people learn that some movies are made for fun and are not necessarily out to change the world? If you realise this then expect to have heaps of fun while watching Bill and Ted's bogus journey. This is a movie that is heaps of fun to watch Keanu and Alex make a great on screen team reprising their characters from Bill and Ted's excellent adventure with even more 'style' then they had in 1st movie. It's not rocket science but it's great for a laugh the characters being extremely like-able and the story-line being so radical you have to laugh. Don't expect 'deep-and-meaningfulls' just expect pure fun! 
 A masterful treatment of James Caine's The Postman Always Rings Twice as Luchino Visconti's first film shot primarily around Ferrara in a soulless war-torn Italy. The original negative was thought destroyed but Visconti saved a print and fortunately we can see this early neo-realist work today. A ruggedly handsome Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai (who had recently revealed her breasts in La Cena delle beffe (1941) star as the sensually-charged and ill-fated lovers who plot to kill her husband. Unusual ending in which although crime does not pay one pays in a way not directly linked to the crime. Excellent direction script acting and cinematography. Reportedly not as good as the French Le Dernier tournant' (1939) but probably better than the US version (1946) featuring Lana Turner and John Garfield in the lead roles. Highly recommended. 
 My fondness for Chris Rock varies with his movies I hated him after Lethal Weapon 4 but I hated everyone in that movie after it.I like him when he is himself and not holding back like in Dogma. Well this is his best yet wasn't expecting this to be that good.Laughed my arse off the whole time. Chris Rock delivers a sweet wonderful story backed by some of the funniest comedy I've seen in quite some time. Loved it. 
 This is one of the great movies of the 80s in MY collection that I think about all the time. The Running Man is one of Arnold`s best and most different films even to this day and when I first saw The Running Man I was so excited to see a movie like this. I just adore all of the fights and this is truly a special movie. It also has Jesse Ventura the legendary Professor Toru Tanaka Sven-Ole Thorsen the beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso Yaphet Kotto Kurt Fuller Richard Dawson and Thomas Rosales Jr. who seems to always like death in his movies because he has been killed in such films as Universal Solder The Lost World Robo Cop 2 Predator 2 and among others. All Arnold fans should love this film from the beginning to the end because its action packed star filled and its one its one of Arnold`s best to date! 
 Perfect for families with small children who are looking for lighthearted films that contain no violence and are enthralling for the child and amusing albeit completely corny to adults. Not a bad film for a low-budget job. Children will be amazed with Santa's workshop and the magic that enables him to enter homes through chimneys that appear too small or homes that have no chimneys at all! Kids will thrill over the Santa's success at thwarting the nasty devil named Pitch (complete in classic red outfit with horns and tail!). They will sympathize with the poor little girl who's greatest wish is to have a little doll to love. And the poor little rich boy who only wishes to spend time with his forever absent parents. And what child does not know someone at school who are just like the nasty boys that are enlisted by Pitch to help capture Santa and ruin Christmas? In the end everyone including the nasty boys get just what they deserve for Christmas! The film will endear children to both Santa and the message of love he delivers to people throughout the world. 
 I don't think I'll ever understand the hate for Renny Harlin. 'Die Hard 2' was cool and he gave the world 'Cliffhanger' one of the most awesome action movies ever. That's right you little punks 'Cliffhanger' rules and we all know it. Sly plays Gabe Walker a former rescue climber who is 'just visiting' his old town when he is asked to help a former friend Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker) assist in a rescue on a mountain peak. Walker obviously came back at a convenient time because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow). Qualen & co. have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the U.S. government somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and they really would like it back... Essentially 'Cliffhanger' is another 'Die Hard' clone. Just trade in the confines of Nakatomi Plaza to the open mountain ranges of the Rocky Mountains complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal. Naturally that set up is totally ripped to shreds soon enough as Stallone's character avoids quite a large number of bullets with ease and slams face-first into several rock faces with no apparent side-effects. After all isn't that what action movies are all about? 'Cliffhanger' is one of the most exciting action movies around. A showcase of great scenes and stunts. One of the early stunts is one of the best stunts I've ever seen in a movie and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning it maintains its action awesomeness. John Lithgow's lead villain is entertaining and one bad dude. Quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever. 'Cliffhanger' is easily one of Stallone's best efforts definitely Renny Harlin's best effort and a very exciting action movie - 9/10 
 I probably saw this movie first in about 1995. Since then I've returned to it many times. It's great! I especially like the first and second clips Creation and Civilization Rising. Wow! This was so cool back in the glory days of CG animation. CG is way older than I am as I know the film Tron was made 7 years before my time. But this film was a landmark in the early '90s. It was probably the first collaboration of different CG experiments set to music. I like it so much I think I'll go watch it now. Bye 
 Wang Bianlian is an old street performer who is known as a 'King of masks' for his mastery of Sichuan change art. Liang is a famous opera performer of Sichuan art and respects Wang as an artist and as a person. Liang is worried that a precious art shouldn't die with Wang and so he sows the seed of an heir in to Wang's mind. The film is about prejudices male domination state of art values and most importantly warmth. I can't recommend this film enough. The whole film is in loops. Everything has a significance. Its a long story which has been edited so well that the length of the film is just 91 minutes. A total satisfaction. For five minutes it is an artistic film next five minutes its a sad film next five minutes its a thriller. It just keeps changing its mood like its protagonist changes his face. Last scene on the rope is phenomenal. Story and script is flawless. Actors are brilliant. Both the protagonists are artists you can tell the way they have performed. Very impressive. It was not even nominated for Oscars. That year 'English patient' got the best film Oscar and in the foreign film category 'Kolya' won. 'Kolya' was just OK and about 'English patient' the lesser said the better. Watch it 9/10. 
 This was a superb episode one of the best of both seasons. Down right horror for a change with a story that is way way above the average MOH episodes if there is such a thing. A man's wife is almost burned to death in a tragic car wreck in which he was driving. His airbag worked her's didn't. She is burned beyond recognition (great makeup btw) and not given much of a chance to live without a full skin graft. BUT even in a coma she keeps dying but brought back by modern technology and when she does die for a few minutes her ghost appears as a very vengeful spirit. Carnage of course ensues and also some extremely gory killings and also some extremely sexy scenes. What more could you ask for you might ask? Well not much because this baby has it all and a very satirical ending that should leave a smile on most viewers faces. I just loved Rob Schmidt's (Wrong Turn) direction too he has a great knack for horror. Excellent episode this is one I'm buying for sure. 
 I have to agree with everyone else that has posted. I watched it quite a while ago but I'll tell you whenever I hear certain music from this anime I am reminded of the story the beautiful animation the characters and the feeling I got when watching it and it does make me cry(such a happy yet sad feeling). I do however find that the love story in it felt alittle rushed and they didn't explain things properly but it didn't ruin any part of the viewing experience. I was into this anime so much that after the end I just had to do some research(and watch the ending a few more times) and I found all my answers and a whole lot more. I love how they configured historical legends to fit into this anime it was amazing and just made me want to research a whole lot more.(I've always been very interested in certain historical figures associated with this anime) I do think it should have been a longer series but if this is all they had to work with then they pulled it off nicely. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes emotional anime with an excellent story well built characters(some mysterious)and a bit of fantasy action. Also even though this was based on a H-game it doesn't have any of that stuff in it and I actually prefer it this way.(I have no problem with mature anime in most cases I prefer it) 
 I can agree with other comments that there wasn't an enormous amount of history discussed in the movie but it wasn't a documentary! It was meant to entertain and I think it did a very good job at it. I agree with the black family. The scenes with them seemed out of place. Like all of a sudden it would be thrown in but I did catch on to the story and the connection between the families later on and found it pretty good. Despite it wasn't a re-enactment of the 60s it did bring into the light very big and important landmark periods of the decade. I found it very entertaining and worth my while to watch. 
 I loved this movie and will watch it again. Original twist to Plot of Man vs Man vs Self. I think this is Kurt Russell's best movie. His eyes conveyed more than most actors words. Perhaps there's hope for Mankind in spite of Government Intervention? 
 Canadian filmmaker Mary Harron is a cultural gadfly whose previous films laid bare some the artistic excess of the Sixties and the hollow avaricious Eighties. With The Notorious Bettie Page she points her unswerving eye at Fifties America an era cloaked in the moral righteousness of Joe McCarthy while experiencing the beginnings of a sexual awakening that would result in the free love of the next decade. Harron and her co-writer Guinevere Turner are clearly not interested in the standard biopic of a sex symbol. This is a film about the underground icon of an era and how her pure unashamed sexuality revealed both the predatory instincts and impure thoughts of a culture untouched by the beauty of a nude body. If the details of Bettie's life were all the film was concerned about then why end it before her most tragic period was about to begin. Clearly Harron is more interested in America's attitudes towards sexual imagery then and now. Together with a fearless lead performance by Gretchen Mol and the stunningly atmospheric cinematography of W.Mott Hupfel III she accomplishes this goal admirably holding up a mirror to the past while making the audience examine their own enlightened 21st Century attitudes towards so-called pornography. As America suffocates under a new conservatism this is a film needed more than ever. 
 The Thing About my Folks came in as a surprise. We had no idea about what to expect. The film directed by Raymond DeFelitta and based on a screen play by one of its stars Paul Reiser proved to be a pleasant time at the movies. Although the film is predictable and we know what will be the outcome this is a voyage of discovery where Ben gets to know his father perhaps for the first time in his life Ben sees his father for what he really is and not the mythical figure he has in his mind. The film seems to be a vehicle for its star Peter Falk and he runs away with the movie as it was expected. Mr. Falk one of the most endearing actors working in movies in this era and in past years is an actor of such stature he must be reckoned with. As Sam Kleinman the distant father to Ben he is a man that clearly is misunderstood not only by Ben but it appears by the whole family and his wife of forty-seven years. When Muriel the matriarch of the Kleinman clan runs away everyone goes into a panic because this woman who has been the strong figure of the family is vital to keep everyone together. Not knowing where she has gone Sam shows up at Ben's house confused as he feels abandoned suddenly by the woman he married and has been faithful for all those years. Ben the youngest son takes his father on a trip to look for a house he wants to buy so he can get his own family out of Manhattan into the country. The trip provides the excuse for Ben to bond with his father in ways he never knew about because the old man had always projected an aloof figure to his younger son. Along the way father and son realize how much they love one another and how misunderstood the old man has been by his children. The love of Sam for Muriel spans the many years they have known one another; they seem inseparable. Peter Falk is magnificent in the film. He makes an excellent Sam Kleinman the man who suddenly realizes his life is about to change for the worst. Mr. Falk shines as the older man and there's never a false movement in his interpretation of the man whose whole world is crumbling under him. Not being a Paul Reiser fan we must confess that as Ben Kleinman he is right. Ben and his father discover how much in common they both have and their love for Muriel the mother that has sacrificed her life in order to keep the family together. Olympia Dukakis is only seen at the end of the film. She makes a good contribution as the fleeing mother. Elizabeth Perkins plays Rachel with great style.. The film has a beautiful look thanks to the cinematography of Dan Gillham and the excellent musical score by Steven Argila. Ultimately the film shows a great team effort between its director Mr. DeFelitta and Paul Reiser who wrote it for the screen. Although this film is clearly targeted for an older audience it should please anyone. 
 My Kasi Lemmings certainly is a fair looking woman. This film is a lost gem a dead-on satire mockumentary of the early 90's Hip Hop scene when MC Hammer had just began to fade away into that good night. We follow the three members of the NWH as they embark upon their picaresque journey of would-be riches and fame. And like Nickolas Nickleby at the end they finish their journey not far from where they started but at least a little wiser and lot less naive. This is one of the best films that no one has ever heard of but it's the kind of film you either love or hate a lot like Company Man in this regard. I regard this movie like the 1000 islands of upstate New York: it's a wonderful little secret you want to keep to yourself. 
 There is a lot of crap coming out of Hollywood lately. A friend sends me movies now and again as a surprise it's awesome. I turned it on and couldn't stop watching it is a drama but with a odd twist. Imagine if Romeo as in Shakepeare had a super power. It is sad and poetic at the same time. Hollywood should take notice of the new Russian cinema they are telling stories that are not about big explosions and cgi. It takes a simple basic premise and tells a story without a spectacle. This is a lot like an Asian film with a dark Russian twist. Granted it's not perfect but nothing ever is. You know what the power is but it is never explained nor totally realized until the end. It becomes secondary to the emotion of the story. I don't want to see a remake it is too cool as is the Hollywood system would as usual mess it up. Acting is top notch all around. Directing and Camera work are far above most of the crap that is out there. Kudos to all involved and I will turn a lot of people on to this independent epic. A+++++ If you can find i watch it. 
 Enormous fun for both adults and children this film works on numerous levels: there is everything from car crashes and cake in the face to some very good (yet subtle) jokes for adults. Glenn Close is at her sublimely evil best as Cruella (`call me Ella') De Ville. After three years in Dr. Pavlov's Behaviour Modification Clinic she is cured of her desire for fur ? even the puppy-skin fur she had so intensely desired. She even has all of her fur coats placed in the dungeon of the extraordinary castle she inhabits. But it wouldn't be a ?Dalmatian' movie without the subterfuge and machinations of Cruella and you know that something will change her behaviour modification. And now she needs one extra puppy (hence 102 Dalmatians) to complete her nefarious scheme this time round. Ioan Gruffudd is instantly appealing as the hero of the film that runs the `Second Chance' dog shelter. Though he was in `Titanic' and in last year's television version (as Pip) of `Great Expectations' I didn't recognize him; well he was ?Fifth Officer Lowe' in `Titanic' and I didn't see `Great Expectations' so I am not terribly surprised. Gerard Depardieu does a delightful turn as the furrier-pawn of Cruella. He prances and postures in the most outlandish and outrageous of fur clothing you have ever seen ? and does it well. His 'Wicked Witch of the West' homage is hilarious. Tim McInnerny is superb is Cruella's not-so-evil henchman ? he was also ?Alonzo ' Cruella's butler in `101 Dalmatians' and you may also recognize him from all of the `Black Adder' Brit-Coms. He plays his usual bumbling good-hearted somewhat dim-witted character to great effect. Oscars for costuming are generally given for the entirety of the costuming in a film. This is unfortunate as the clothing worn by Glenn Close is amazing ? it is incredibly detailed (note her handcuffs when she is being released from the Behaviour Modification Clinic) and worthy of such an over-the-top character. Her clothing alone deserves at least an Oscar nomination. Animation holds a special place in my heart ? but comparing this film to the original animated film is like comparing apples to orangutans: it can't be done. Suffice it to say that `102 Dalmatians' is even better than the film version of `101 Dalmatians' that came out in 1996. There is a lot to like here: from the sight gags the dialogue and the costumes to the casting - it is a good film for the whole family. 
 The movie Frailty is actually more of a psychological thriller than it is a horror film. It has all the trappings of a horror film but this it is not. Frailty is a film about perceptions of religion and realizing the differences between right and wrong. In Frailty a middle-aged father (Bill Paxton) and his two sons claim to be doing the work of God. It turns out that they are a trio of notorious serial killers called God's Hands . We watch the father kill the demons in some rather brutal ways while convincing his sons and himself that they are doing the work God and that what they are doing is right. He claims that he received a message from an angel who gave him specific instructions to eliminate the demons living here on earth. God has given him a list of names and in return for his services ; he and his sons will be given protection which basically means the police will never be able to capture them. We see all of this unfold in front of us in a very disturbing manner. But what is really disturbing about it all is the effect that it has on the two sons particularly the oldest son Adam. Adam himself seriously doubts the existence of a supreme being that is until his father and a week in the cellar changes all of that. He knows that his father has obviously lost his mind and is pretty sure the same is happening to his younger brother Fenton. Fenton the other half of this puzzle takes everything in as if it were his own religion. He seems trapped in his father's world of God and demons. I suppose this is because he's so young and easily impressionable. But everything that happens to these three is rather convincing in fact TOO convincing. The events that occur in the film can be looked upon as a vivid hallucination that is being experienced by the three main characters. I say this because they each react to the situation in different ways and at one point in the film they each claim to see God. Dad first sees the murders as his mission. His mission eventually consumes him and quickly turns into an obsession with eradicating demons. In fact his hallucination is the primary one. His orders and the list of names he receives are all a part of this hallucination. Watch the scene where Dad finds the ax in a barn to figure out where I am coming from. Fenton the younger son is easily impressed by all of this talk of demons and destruction. Since he is so young it's easy for him to fall into his father's trap. Adam on the other is very skeptical towards his father's actions. ***SPOILERS*** In a way the hallucination ends when Dad is killed towards the end of the movie. (I will not say how or under what circumstances). But I will say that it is not pleasant. After his death it fast-forwards to the present day. (The story is being told through flashbacks as seen through the eyes of the oldest son Adam). In actuality it is Fenton that is telling the story not Adam as originally believed. The story is being told the way he perceived it through his actions and his brother's actions. Fenton has gone insane and is continuing what his father started by luring the FBI agent into his trap. Since religion is a major theme in this movie the film also plays on how easy it is for religion to be misinterpreted by those that do not have a full understanding of it. Before Dad discovered his newfound mission he himself did not have a clear understanding of religion nor did he fully believe in a supreme being. His sons Fenton and Adam often sang innocent little children's church hymns but yet probably did not have a clear understanding of what the lyrics meant. After the revelation of Dad's newfound mission they both took off in separate directions - Adam remained in doubt of there being a supreme being while Fenton was gradually sucked into his father's madness. A very good thriller that will creep the heck out of you do not watch it alone. 
 I've watched it plenty of times and I'm planning on buying the full feature. I love all of Jason Steele's comedy. It's very different and unique and is very enjoyable. I love indie films and this one is just great. The plot is strange but very funny. This short film is about a talking Spatula named Edward. The order of the events are a bit jumbled making this film very interesting to watch. At first you see Edward fighting the spoons but then the focus changes to earlier in his life. This is a silly movie but of course it's still great. I highly recommend that you watch this film at www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com. It's very funny. The humour may not match everybody's taste but watch anyway. It'll only take 16 minutes of your time and it's free. GO WATCH SPATULA MADNESS! 
 I have to point out before you read this review that in no way is this a statement against Iranian people ... if you really want to read something into it than hopefully you see that I'm against politicians in general ... but if you're looking to be offended ... I can't help you! Not in Iran as this movie is banned there (see IMDb trivia for this movie). Which is a shame because the movie is great. Would it not be for Grbavica this movie would have won at the International Film Festival in Berlin. Rightfully so (it was the runner-up or second place if you will). Why? Because it is a movie about oppression. It's not even that this is a complete women issue. It is about the government trying to keep the people down. An analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the movie. But by banning it nothing is resolved and/or can they make this movie disappear! Another reviewer had a great summary line: Comedy about a tragedy that sums it up pretty well! 
 When I heard that this movie was coming out the night before Halloween I was very excited. When I found out that it was a book written in 1978 I had to read it before seeing the movie. I'm sure the movie would have been much different to me if I had not read the book. The writers actually did a good job of staying true to the main plot of the book with minor differences naturally. I think the thing that disappointed me the most about the movie was Boyle playing the role of Col. I'm not a big fan of Boyle and it seems that no matter what the mood during the movie she's always trying to use her over-plumped lips and darkly makeup-ed eyes to make herself seem super sexy. Indeed I think that the movie held true to the genuine creepiness of the house. My favorite subplot was the Sheehan family (which is so weird b/c the son was killed in Iraq and in current events there is Casey Sheehan whose mother went on a huge anti-Iraq tirade). In the book obviously the war was not Iraq but rather Vietnam and when the house turns on that video of the son in the helicopter I was truly creeped out. Overall I was impressed with the movie in that it followed the book very well. 
 24 is the best television show!!!!! It's an incredible TV series with an incredible suspense excellent plots and unforgettable characters. And the first episode of all is my best evidence. Because it's only the first episode only the introduction and you are hooked because of the plot and the continuous twists and turns. Jack Bauer is a federal agent who is assigned the protection of the senator David Palmer. He can't trust in anybody because people of the CTU may be involved. And when this events occurred his daughter: Kimberly escapes from house to a party. But... At the end of the episode you want to watch more and more and more. It's only the first of the lot and it's excellent. 
 Have just finished watching this film which upset me greatly. Have also been to South Africa twice around the time this film is set. It is certainly hard-hitting and the opening scenes tend to 'set the scene'. The slow but steady increase of pace hardly allows a break and there are certainly few light moments. Will never be able to view Nigel Hawthorne the same again. He came across as a very twisted individual and I found myself disliking him more each time he appeared. Totally agree with Steve-thomp's articulate and well thought-out comments. 
 Uncompromising look at a suburb in 21st century Vienna mixing the stories of six groups of characters by former documentary maker U.Seidl is a provocative minimalistic and intense piece of observation cinema. After the world-wide spread of Big Brother reality shows Hundstage takes modern voyeurism to an unsettling profound level. Hard to like but unignorable piece of European art-cinema might seem cruel and seedy yet manages to convey the nihilistic alienated feeling of modern society in a praiseworthy manner. A must for lovers of world cinema. 
 What's not to like about this movie? Every year you know that you're going to get one or two yule tide movies during Christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible. This movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty well. A very funny take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real Christmas for him. What is the good of having money like that if you can't do fun things with it. It was a win-win situation. A regular family gets six figures and a rich guy gets to experience Christmas like he imagined. Only if. Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands. It was a fun and funny movie. 
 I contend that whoever is ultimately responsible for creating/approving the trailer for this movie has completely blundered. NO ONE I know wanted to see this movie based on the previews and EVERYONE who actually saw it (that I know) absolutely loved it... The advertising campaign is disgrace/disaster/blunder. Opened at #4 behind... #1-Rush Hour which I have not seen average IMDb score of 7.4. #2-The Bourn Ultimatum which I have seen awesome movie but 3rd week out average IMDb score of 8.7 (deserving I would say). #3-The Simpsons Movie which I have seen okay movie but 4th week out average IMDb score of 8.1 (a bit high in my opinion). #4-Stardust average IMDb score of 8.4 (lower then Bourn but that's been our for 3 weeks). Whether it was poor scheduling or poor advertising I think that the powers that be behind this movie screwed up big time! This should have been advertised as an amazing movie that happens to be a fantasy/fairytale and not advertised as just another fairytale? Too bad :( Anyway- Now that I have very pointlessly ranted on-and-on... Awesome movie go see it! 
 And I really mean that. I caught it last night on Vh1 and I was not expecting it to be so good. This is now one of my favorites. I must add that it has a killer soundtrack. 
 A beautiful postcard of New York. The thing I enjoyed most was being able to watch this with my whole family and not cringe waiting for a stupid toilet humor joke to appear. It never did. My teenagers liked it too. My son for Natasha Henstridge and my daughter for Michael Vartan. My wife and I commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and ALL enjoy something. This film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or done. The ending came with a twist which we all liked too. If you are not just a cynical person and have are willing to let a story unfold then this is for you. As a guy it takes a lot to hold my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did. I recommend it and we need more of these films to watch. 
 My girlfriend and I have a thing for Robots. So I try to seek out movies that have robots. And this movie has robots. Big ones. They beat the clang and bang out of each other with the fate of nations hanging in the balance. It's really cool. You have to forgive this movie its many shortcomings and just try to appreciate what the director and his crew of technicians were able to put on the screen while working with what was obviously a tight budget. It is very hard to dislike this movie. Because of those big robots. They looked like Transformers and they fought like pro wrestlers! It made my girlfriend smile. And that is good enough for me. And special mention must be made of veteran character actor Paul Koslo: as the maniacal Russian Villain whether he is ruthlessly stomping on his helpless opponents after they've already surrendered or complaining that their close proximity to him in a bar has caused his vodka to taste like blood (a line he delivers with a deliciously campy sub-Bela Lugosi accent) he is clearly having a ball and the film benefits enormously whenever he is on-screen. This is a nifty little flick that deserves its cult reputation. 
 It was a bit bizarre and evil and i enjoyed it a lot the characters in the show were great as well and complimented one another well. I was sorry to see it cut off.. I would have loved to see where it could have went.You found yourself leaning toward Lucas Buck the sheriff who had more secrets than anyone. Lucas was frightening and alluring. And I would have liked to have seen more of him and how his character became. I will however buy the show just to enjoy it was great to something different on TV. And Paige Turrco who was Caleb's cousin she was a big mystery as to where and what she meant to Lucas. Its a shame it isn't around still.. or was never finished i would have loved to see what would have happened. 
 I was the Production Accountant on this movie and I also got to do some voice-over work on it so I'm not entirely unbiased but if it were awful I would say so. I thought it was a fun film not a critically acclaimed masterpiece by any means but there were plenty of laughs along the way. The Bible states that laughter does good like a medicine so watching this movie could be good for your health. So many of the actors in this picture hadn't yet reached their peak at the time we made this film. Susan Sarandon of course is one who has since gone on to much greater fame. Melanie Mayron was seen on TV on a weekly basis as a photographer in the Thirty-Something TV drama series. Robert Englund later became known as Freddie Krueger still haunting people's dreams. One of my personal favorite actors on this show was Dub Taylor who played the sheriff. He was an excellent comedic actor and a truly nice sincere person. We all had fun working on this show and I think that fun comes through. 
 I saw this in the theater and I instantly thought that it is good enough to own on video. I am a big nut for Sci-Fi action flicks though anyway. Without giving any of the story away it is worth seeing if you like Sci-Fi without requiring much thought. The story is basic and the plot is very good. Worth your time to see! Maybe they will make a sequel? :) 8 out of 10 
 Eric Stoltz delivers an extraordinary performance as Joel Garcia a successful young novelist who winds up paralyzed and in a special hospital for the recently disabled after breaking his neck in a hiking accident. While learning to cope and adjust with the gravity of his new limited physical condition Joel befriends slick fast-talking charming womanizer Raymond (an amazing Wesley Snipes) and boorish surly racist biker Bloss (a terrific William Forsythe) who feels threatened by the diverse multi-ethnic array of fellow patients he's forced to share a room with. Joel also receives substantial support from his loyal and loving but married girlfriend Anna (radiantly played by Helen Hunt). But he still must come to terms with being disabled on his own. This remarkable movie's key triumph is its laudably stubborn refusal to neither sanitize nor sentimentalize the severity of what these men are going through. Directors Neil Jimenez (who also wrote the thoughtful and insightful script) and Micheal Steinberg relate the story with exceptional taste wit and warmth specifically addressing with disarming candor and matter-of-factness how being handicapped irrevocably alters one's lifestyle including and especially your sex life (this point is most powerfully made in a striking sequence when Joel and Anna try and fail to make love in a motel room). Besides the expected poignancy the film further provides a surprising surplus of wickedly funny raw earthy humor that's highlighted by the uproarious sequence with Joel and Bloss making a secret nocturnal expedition to a strip club. The uniformly superb acting qualifies as another significant plus: Stoltz Snipes Forsythe and Hunt are all outstanding with stand-out supporting turns by Grace Zabriskie as Bloss' doting amiable mother and Elisabeth Pena and William Allen Young as compassionate hospital nurses. Despite the grim subject matter the film ultimately proves to be a very moving positive and uplifting cinematic testament to the astonishing strength and durability of the human spirit. A simply wonderful little gem of a drama. 
 This is a very rare example of a movie about transvestitism (of heterosexuals). The film treats the taboo theme so that even a general audience not knowing of transvestitism at all will strongly sympathize with its main character. Adrian Pasdar is very believable as Gerald/Geraldine and shall not be forgot for this brillant acting. The directing of Christopher Monger is very sensitively treating such a difficult issue quite excellently packed into a good story. Not a big movie neither an art film but a little lovely motion picture! 
 I think that people are under estimating this incredible film. People are seeing it as a typical horror movie that is set out to scare us and prevent us from getting some sleep. Which if it was trying to do then it would deservedly get a 1/10 but i viewed this film with a few friends and we found it very entertaining and though it was a good movie after all it does have Stephanie beaton. This is the reason why i think that it deserves the 10/10 for the pure entertainment of the film. The general view on this movie is that it has bad acting a simple script that a 10 year old could produce and that it cant be taken seriously and people are rating it low because of this. But i see this as a thoroughly entertaining masterpiece...that has a hilariously funny script which is made even more entertaining by the actors and although not very serious it is very entertaining. 
 I bought this a year or more ago for $2 (yep $2) left it on the shelf for ages now watching DVDs while holed up with a cold. This is a haunting movie. Brilliant performances by all involved especially the 6yo boy (about the only smiles you get in this movie). Plot reminds me of perhaps my favourite movie ever Grosse Pointe Blank but obviously that's lighthearted this is heavy hearted. As a psychologist a clinical and forensic psychologist a shiver went up my spine when the identity of the new contract was revealed. Scary stuff! Brilliant work all round. Pete 
 A film destined to be on late-night TV long after the present instant money-makers have long been forgotten. Perhaps a little too subtle for today's youngsters but in time they'll grow into an appreciation of this movie. 
 I love this movie. I mean the story may not be the best but the dancing most certainly makes up for it. You get to know a little bit about each character the way THEY want you to learn about them. I just think that you won't like this movie unless you're into Broadway... 
 It's one of the best movies I've seen in the last 2 years (I've seen the premier in Tel-Aviv Israel in the summer of 2006 exactly when the last war has began...) This problem in communication between the people that causes wars is interesting me for a long time and it doesn't matter who- boys and girls straight and gays Jews and Arabs... I've seen the Bubble already 3 times and it still surprising and exciting me- each character reminds me of one of the many people i know and the difference between them like between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem... The last time i saw it- was with my friend who is a Christian Arab and it was on the independence day of Israel ( the most symbolic i could ! how ironic) and... he cried in the end!!! - if he's been touched and wasn't embarrassed- everyone would be touched by The Bubble! 
 This was the first televised episode of the Columbo series (although it was filmed after Death Lends a Hand )and it heralded one of the most successful TV series in history. Jack Cassidy (who played the murderer in the series three times) enthuses smugness arrogance and self-assuredness in equal measure here as Ken Franklin one half of a mystery writing team who hatches an elaborate plot to kill off his partner Jim Ferris (played by Martin Milner) who decides to terminate their professional relationship leaving Franklin exposed as merely a good publicist rather than a prolific writer. The initial murder set-up is fantastic and Cassidy's performance facilitates an arguable accolade that he was the best Columbo murderer in the series. Peter Falk is wonderfully understated in his role as Columbo and the character's inherent traits and oddities which are underlined by a seeming slowness and absent-mindedness contrast particularly well with Cassidy's character's extreme smugness: one of their early scenes together where Ken Franklin fabricates a motive for the killing through Jim Ferris's non-existent expo-see of identifying hit-men operating in the underworld exemplifies this very well. Franklin hints to Columbo this potential motive and Columbo (purposely or ignorantly) fails to latch on forcing Franklin to express his disappointment in a markedly patronising manner and compare him unfavourably with the detective in the books Mrs. Melville. Also noteworthy is the early directorial contribution of 24 year old Steven Spielberg. Notwithstanding some elementary inclusions of cameras shadowing the actors and actresses he adds some stylish and elaborate touches to uphold the general professionalism of the episode. One particularly stark image is of Jim Feriss's dead body lying on the settee almost dark in the foreground as Ken Franklin raises a glass to him in the background after he finishes answering a phone call to Ferris's distraught wife. I have no doubt that working to a restrictive 10-14 day schedule Spieberg's efforts should not be underestimated. Unfortunately the event of the second murder necessitated by a blackmailing scheme which is plotted by a female friend of Franklin's (and ironically referred to as sloppy by Columbo in his climatic summing up) takes the steam out of the whole thing. The cutting edge of the plot is compromised and the screen-time between Falk and Cassidy inexcusably lessens at this point to perhaps help the script-writer (Stephen Bocho) out of a tight corner since he cannot singularly develop the story without another murder. The climax is the most disappointing aspect of this episode. The initial banter and exchange of words between Falk and Cassidy is strongly and effectively executed but it merely advertises the fact that it should have happened more in the episode. The main aggravation lies with the sealing clue (if it can be called a clue): Cassidy's character's hitherto smugness and arrogance is amazingly expelled by a clue that really does little to imply his guilt; and once this is mentioned he capitulates in a rather unspectacular and uncharacteristic fashion. All in all a bold opening to the series which inevitably advertises and foretells all that is good about Columbo and conversely the problems associated with such ingenuity i.e maintaining the high standards and particularly creating a credible and suitably intelligent ending. 
 Keep in mind I'm a fan of the genre but have only recently seen this film for the first time. How I've overlooked it all this time is a wonder to me. To me this is a better film then the much lauded High Noon . It's a great western with excellent acting and a great story. The DVD is in beautifull black and white with outstanding cinematography. If you like westerns or James Stewart this film is not to be missed. 
 This is undeniably the scariest game I've ever played. It's not the average shoot-everything-that-moves kind of fps (which I usually don't care much for) but the acceptable gfx interesting weapons and magic great surround soundeffects ( Scryeeee scryeeee.. ) and above all incredible atmosphere. I love the Scrye which enables you at certain places in the games to see or hear events that happened there in the past. The only game I've had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of playing just because of the intensity of the atmosphere. I'm a great horror fan escpecially of Clive Barker's stories and movies and participating in a horror story like this makes me yearn for more games that emphasizes atmosphere and a more involving story. 9/10 (-1 because I'm no fps fan and perhaps the game was a bit short?) 
 Excellent movie a realistic picture of contemporary Finland touching and profound. One of the best Finnish films ever made. Captures marvelously the everyday life in a Central Finland small town people's desires and weaknesses joys and sorrows. The bright early fall sunshine creates a cool atmosphere to this lucid examination of people in a welfare society. Lampela is indeed one of the most promising Finnish filmmakers. He shows that it is possible to make gripping movies without machine guns and bloodshed. His next film Eila is also worth seeing although the story of cleaning women fighting for their jobs is not quite as universally appealing as the destinies in Joki. 
 It is Queen Victoria's misfortune to be defined as an historical figure according to her relationships with men.Shortly after she succeeded to the throne she came under the influence of her Prime Minister Lord Melbourne to the extent that she became known as Mrs Melbourne .After the death of her beloved husband Albert she was referred to as The Widow at Windsor and years later a long friendship with her Scottish ghillie John Brown earned her the nickname Mrs Brown .Such is the price women paid in a patriarchal society. The reality is somewhat different and Young Victoria goes some way towards putting the record straight depicting the queen as an intelligent and independent young woman conscious of the inequities in her society and at her court. Courts have always been hotbeds of seething jealousy plotting and counter-plotting naked ambition and sometimes outright murder. As an 18 year old innocent Victoria ascended to her uncle's throne thus initiating a positive orgy of intrigue and a power-struggle between Prime minister Lord Melbourne and his rival Sir Robert Peel. Lord Melbourne cuts a dash in the Old Public School Man kind of way with his finely-honed cynicism and his well-polished gems of advice. Hardly surprising then that the young queen finds herself in awe of him and even perhaps a little in love an awe that he ruthlessly exploits drawing a fine line between attempted seduction and attempted sedition as he forces his policies through against Victoria's better judgement. Into the arena rides Prince Albert on a mission from King Leopold of Belgium keen on political rapprochement between Great Britain and the rest of Europe. At first a reluctant suitor he soon falls in love with the English queen and palliates the influence of the politicians and courtiers. The Young Victoria is a beautifully photographed brilliantly-scored and very sumptuous movie.I note that it has been criticised in some quarters for this sumptuousness as if a movie about 19th century English Royalty should somehow have shown the Empress of India and her family living in rags in a filthy workhouse........I don't think so. I must single out the remarkable Miss Emily Blunt whose beauty reminded me of the young Princess Margaret's.Hers is obviously the pivotal role and she has absolutely no trouble in dominating the film despite strong performances from Mr Jim Broadbent Miss Miranda Richardson and Miss Harriet Walter all immeasurably more experienced. The music is suitably regal and forms a cohesive part of the whole movie without being in any way obtrusive. The fact that Britan flourished more under its two great queens Elizabeth the First and Victoria than at any other time is a matter Feminists might like to make more of but I suspect like Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher really powerful women make them feel uncomfortable.If you can work out why there might be a Ph.D . in it. 
 In Holland a gay writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe) gives a lecture. He stays overnight with a beautiful woman Christine (Renee Soutendijk) and has sex with her (by imagining she's a boy). He plans to leave the next day but gets a look at a picture of Christine's hunky boyfriend Herman (Thom Hoffman) and decides to stay to have a try at him. Then things get strange. A big X-rated art house hit in the US in 1983. Why was it X rated? Let's see...there's strangulation full frontal male and female nudity castration mutilation simulated sex a scene in a church with a cross that will shock most people a gay sex scene in a crypt...and it's all a comedy!!!!! Paul Verhoeven made this after Spetters . Spetters was attacked by the critics for it's extreme sexual sequences and denounced as trash. So Verhoeven filled this film with very obvious symbolism thinking the critics would think it was art and praise it. He was right! Critics loved the film not realizing that Verhoeven was playing a big joke on them. Still it's a great film. It's beautifully shot by Jan de Bont (now a director himself) and there's so much symbolism and obvious hidden layers in the dialogue that you're never bored. All the acting is great--Krabbe plays a thoroughly despicable character but (somehow) has you rooting for him; Soutendijk is just stunning to look at and plays her part to perfection--the little smile she gives when Gerard agrees to stay with her is chilling; Hoffman is extremely handsome with a great body--he deserves credit for doing the church sequence and going at with Krabbe in the crypt. This is not for people easily offended or the weak of heart but if you like extreme movies that playfully challenge you (like me) this is for you! A 10 all the way. 
 Yeah the poster is quite a horrible piece of work. I thought the movie was OK...nothing really outstanding...I just was hoping that he would be a hardcore druggie and totally trash his life. Ahh but that can't happen to rich kids now can it? Not to the son of a wealthy businessman who holds big ballroom parties and has a nice manicured lawn on the front of the mini mansion. No...the kid is too good to have his life totally trashed. After all who will drive the brand new SUV and who will go to law school? Ah the poor little rich kids...in their quaint pretty house with their ivy league schools ultra clean homes and socialite parties...what will the world do without them? I hope they all get addicted to drugs pass-away their life and end up in jail...so maybe we can see movies that don't all revolve around the poor little rich boys and girls of the surreal world. 
 The latest film by the Spanish director Agusti Villaronga is a study on how children that experience violence and isolation within their remote community develop into troubled young adults that need certain psychic tools to deal with their hidden mental frailty. Whether these tools are religion followed to a fanatical level caring for others or simply putting on a macho image whilst engaging as a male-prostitute Villaronga creates a successful examination of how these vices affect three teenagers living in Spain under Franco. The three witness the disturbing double death or their friends before they are teenagers and subsequently bury the emotions they feel with their peers frail corpses until they meet again once more at a hospital for those suffering form tuberculosis. The cinematic style of the text is typically visually opulent as you would expect from the Spanish auteur and is extremely reminiscent of fellow Spaniard Pedro Almodovar's work with themes dealing with sexual desire both heterosexual and homosexual. An element that is different between the two directors is that Villaronga favours a supernatural undertone spliced with claustrophobic gritty realism opposed to Almodovar's use of surrealism although both styles are similar. The piece gives an insight into troubled young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature. I highly recommend watching this film as it contains elements that will remain with the audience for a considerable period after viewing. 
 Well-made but basically dreary low-life melodrama which according to the accompanying interview with lead Isabelle Huppert writer/director Pialat infused with a good deal of autobiographical detail; given the mainly unsympathetic characters involved it doesn't do him any compliments - and he does seem to have been a troubled man as Huppert also says that Pialat often disappeared for days on end during the shoot! The acting is uniformly excellent however; despite their relatively young age Huppert and co-star Gerard Depardieu (as the title character!) were already at the forefront of modern French stars - a status which with varying degrees of success they both still hold to this day. I have 3 more of Pialat's films in my VHS To Watch pile albeit all in French without English Subtitles; due to this fact but also LOULOU'S oppressive realism - in spite of its undeniable artistic merit - I can't say that I'm in any particular hurry to check them out now... 
 In Iran women are not admitted to soccer games. Officially it's because they are to be spared from the vulgar language and behavior of the male audience. But of course it is about sexism. Women are lower forms of human beings. Some brave girls oppose this and try to get into the stadium by using different tricks. They are caught by soldiers and hold in a kind of cage until the police will come and pick them up. Despite the insane situation this is a film with lots of humor. It's also encouraging to see how people always find different ways of fighting oppression. You'll get touched at the same time as you have lots of laughs. Good job by director Jafar Panahi. This is in many ways a heroic comedy. 
 This is so exciting! After I saw La Roue this afternoon a short light-hearted little movie I consider this one a real treat! This is absolutely delightful and one of the most charming pictures I saw this year. It is the more amazing since it is an early talkie and puts some great pictures of the 30's to shame due to its innovative use of sound in cinema. It's simply filled with music and an adorable mood that's really upbeat and bottom line it made me happy! Obviously it wouldn't be so difficult to retrieve the lottery ticket the male lead was looking for but the pace is so exhilarating and the movie is so spectacularly entertaining that I didn't even think of it twice. The comedy is many times hilarious and I think it is even superior to the Marx Brothers possibly the biggest comedic force of the time. This is rather perfect. 
 The mystery here is why this delightful small comedy has been ignored by most critics and has failed to find the audience it deserves. Simply showcasing the budding talent of Audrey Tautou should be enough to generate greater recognition from the cognoscenti. Lacking in pretension and relying on quirky characterizations it?s rumination on the interconnection of human behavior manages to be both amusing and life affirming and unlike some of its? more critically acclaimed competition in the genre such as The Taste of Others it actually entertains. 
 Here's a real weirdo for you. It starts out with another take-off on the PSYCHO shower scene on campus then gets crazier when several coeds and their doofy boyfriends head south for Spring Break. The trouble starts when they drive into the redneck county ruled by homicidal Sheriff Dean. One of the college cuties wanders into the woods witnesses a murder by the sheriff and has her head blown open. Then it's lets-rip-off MACON COUNTY LINE-time as Dean stalks traps and slaughters the witless witnesses one by one. Tony March is on-target as the evil shotgun-happy Dean. The movie's overall tone is truly disturbing. The ending is so abrupt you almost think the director ran out of film; it's also a study in despair. SHALLOW GRAVE is a must for misanthropes misogynists and nihilists the world over. 
 Unlike other commenters who have commented on this movie's ability to transcend race contrarily I think that this powerful film provides a complex and deep story that addresses institutional racism and the effects thereof. Washington directs Fisher's story with a careful hand and critical eye relinquishing this cinematic endeavor neither to dismemberment of women's bodies perpetuating unthoughtful stereotypes nor satisfying the expectation of the white gaze. I think this film might be a bit too happy in the end; however it is deeply entrenched in Afro-American culture and discourse to the point that some white spectators may get the feeling of looking into the life of this Afro-American--Antwone Fisher. I have problems with the Naval aspect of the film but when we look at America there are not many choices or opportunities for black men who are/were in Fisher's situation or similar situations. Viewers may go to this movie expecting a Black Movie: what is a Black Movie? Do stereotypes of pimps whores drug dealers single parent homes and so forth constitute a Black Movie? I think Washington as director recognized that Afro-Americans and other people of color deal with human problems like abuse and displaced aggression to name a few. These problems have--historically and presently--only been given light and validity via Good Will Hunting and other white movies; it's high time they were given the same recognition and validity as their white counterparts in and out of the media. Sad to say though in this racist country Denzel Washington and Derek Luke will probably have to wait another ten years before they receive an Oscar or anything else. They both will have to wait until they direct or star in a movie that perpetuates the usual racist and sexist stereotypes to get an Oscar. That is to say Denzel deserved awards for Malcolm X Hurricane and others before that jive Training Day Oscar. That is not to negate or push aside other great actresses and actors of color who are denied their due praise for ingenious work. Yet Hollywood would rather send the message that racism and sexism and heterosexism are acceptable by perpetuating and even rewarding those stereotypes as they appear in countless films such as American Beauty Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil American Pie and even Gone with the Wind. Derek Luke is a helluva actor and I wish him best. All of the other actresses and actors gave superb performances hands down although I do take issue with Denzel's selection of yet another straight-haired light-skinned sistuh. That said everyone should watch this film. However it may not be for everyone. Much Luv. 10/10 
 I saw ZP when it was first released and found it a major disappointment. Its script seemed forced and arch and too fakey '60s. It's politics too upfront and ridiculous. And let's face it I was still under a love-spell known as BLOWUP : and I still haven't completely shaken it. Now the love is twisted up with all sorts of nostalgia it evokes and oh well . . . Good Luck to me! But time marches on and time has been kind to ZP and time has been a teacher to me. I revisit this film about every ten years and it just gets better and better with age. And ZP is it's own experience and is only really linked to BLOWUP through its creator the late great Mr. Antonioni. Twelve years ago I had the great good fortune to see an absolutely pristine print projected at its correct size (immense) restored by an Italian government cultural agency who knows a good work of art when they see it and knows the importance of keeping such a thing of beauty in good shape. To this day I remember the gasp from the audience when the first shot of Death Valley appeared. It was like a thousand volt visual shock Antonioni had intentionally delivered to wake us up to a new level of awareness. And indeed what follows from that point is an entirely different sort of place . What is astonishing to me is how this film is coming into its own. I remember the second time around seeing it --- the early 80s --- I had begun to feel affection towards the film as a whole and towards Daria and Mark in particular. Whereas before these two seemed like a smart-alecky shadow version of Zefferelli's Olivia and Leonard (read: Romeo and Juliet)they now were engaging me --- particularly The Girl in her insistent slo-motion-ality. She-took-her-time . . . To Live. Everything EVERYTHING dies around her. Upon exciting the theater the daylight of Reality quickly began to erase my new found enjoyment . The encroaching shoulder-padded big haired 80s whispered But that's a hippie fantasy --- let it go The force of Antonioni's vision had I had realised already worked itself inside of me the FIRST time around so I answered 80s with an Uh-Huh and guarded my love secretly possessively and jealously. But this then is what good art does it lives inside of you and if you wish it has its way and loves you back: secretly jealously and possessively. And you get changed . Was thrilled to see that Turner Classic Movies had decided to show ZP in its March lineup. Undoubtedly ZP must be seen on a gigantic screen so that it can truly take you into its constructed environment. But hey sometimes even a glimpse of the Beloved in a newspaper photo is no better than no glimpse at all. Today reality hit ZP has been withdrawn mysteriously and replaced with the whiney antics of ALICE'S RESTAURANT. So it is still too difficult too disturbing too what ? Maybe it's that as with all good art it Lives while everything dies around it. Peace. 
 This movie is more Lupin then most especially coming from Funimation. Other then the bad dub it isn't bad. The first hour is a lot like the Comic (which is what all Lupin the 3rd stuff is based on). Lupin's trying to get a huge treasure. Fujiko's using Lupin's weakness to women to try to get something out of it. The last bit isn't that bad he's with another women but of course Fujiko's still him number one. A lot of the other Lupin movies are more Family with cuss words then Lupin. Any good Lupin fan I think will be pleasantly surprised (I know I was after hearing so many bad things about this movie). It might be a bit better without the little animations rolling during the credits (they make it a little mushy) but overall it isn't a bad film. Good enough to be one of the few I'd watch again of the Lupin III movies. 
 Galaxy Express 999 (Ginga tetsud? Three-Nine). Made in 1979. Directed by Rintaro. Based on the original work by Leiji Matsumoto. What little I know of the history of GALAXY EXPRESS 999 it was first published as a popular manga in 1970's and was created by Leiji Matsumoto. GE999 is set in the same Star Wars-type of space universe as Matsumoto's other famous space manga: CAPTAIN HARLOCK. In fact space pirate Harlock and other characters from that manga (including Queen Emeraldas and Tochir? Oyama) make appearances in GE999. GE999 was a success as a manga and was soon followed by also popular anime series which included over 100 episodes. It was aired in 1978. A year later came this anime film which isn't a sequel to the series but summaries the main points of the story in two hours long movie. The story is set in unidentified Star Wars-type of future where journeying to different planets has become a possibility. People of the future can have themselves mechanical bodies in which they can live hundreds of years maybe even forever. The protagonist Tetsur? Hoshino is a young boy who witnesses how a cruel Count Mecha whose entire body is made of mechanical parts kills Tetsur?'s mother. Tetsur? swears revenge and is convinced that he can only achieve it by having a mechanical body. To obtain it he must travel to a far-away planet with space train Galaxy Express 999. However since Tetsur? comes from poverty he has no money to obtain the expensive ticket. By a chance coincidence he meets a beautiful young woman Maetel who bears a resemblance to his dead mother. Maetel offers a ticket for Tetsur? on a condition that she accompanies him on his journey. And so the journey begins? I first saw this film last October about six months from now and again yesterday. I feel that I must first tell about the thing that bothered me the most in this film: it seems very rushed. Then again what can you expect from 2 hours long movie that tries to tell the main points of over 100 episodes long series? Whatever the case the situations change with a fast speed and Tetsur? meets other important characters in the story mostly by pure chance. I feel makers should have either left something out or include extra 30 minutes. However there's no arguing that GE999 has deserved its place as an anime classic. The animation itself very faithful to the style of Matsumoto's manga is detailed and beautiful to watch. Even after almost 30 years of its release the animation has not become out of date but puts many later anime films in shame. The music through out the film is enjoyable to listen even if somewhat old these day (it was the 70's after all). I have not heard any English dub of this film so I can only comment the Japanese audio which is good. Voice actors give life to their characters most memorable ones being Masako Nozawa (mainly known as the voice of Goku through out the entire Dragon Ball saga) as the excited and young Tetsur? and Masako Ikeda as the calm and mysterious Maetel. The supporting characters are not left in shadows but also have a life of their own most memorable to me being waitress Claire. The story itself is suitable for both those who are looking for an entertainment for couple of hours as well as for those who try to find deeper messages. GE999 is an entertaining adventure film but can also be seen as Tetsur?'s journey from boyhood to manhood. The whole film is told from his point of view so we are forced to feel what he feels. I think many people can relate to Tetsur? for despite the fantasy elements he is a very realistic character: young hot headed awkward and naive. We follow him as he starts to see differences between humans and machines and come to conclusion whether he wants the mechanical body or not. Maetel on the other hand stays as a mystery in the film and even in the end when she reveals who and what she really is it doesn't much answer to anything. Maetel can be seen as a dream of a growing young man always close but just out of reach. It's is the strange yet beautiful relationship between Tetsur? and Maetel that still awakes talking and questions and fascinates after the decades. People have argued if their relationship is that of a two friends of mother and son or of two possible lovers (which wakes a lot of critique since Maetel's age is unknown and Tetsur? hasn't even reached his puberty yet). Without any means to sound deep I think the best term to describe them is soul mates . There is no question that the two feel devotion caring and love for each others yet it goes beyond that of friendship family and lovers. I think that if their relationship would be stuffed in any of those categories it would take something out of the whole film and of the characters. The ending scene even if you already know what is going to happen is still very touching and memorable. All in all despite the rushing of plot and some corny scenes GALAXY EXPRESS 999 holds its place as an anime classic amongst the films like Katsuhiro Otomo's AKIRA (1988) and Mamoru Oshii's GHOST IN THE SHELL (1995). The film is directed by Rintaro who had previous experience of Leiji Matsumoto's works as he had worked in CAPTAIN HARLOCK series. Later Rinatro directed a wonderful looking METROPOLIS (2001) that also questions the difference between humans and machines. GALAXY EXPRESS 999 (1979) is a classic that should be seen at least once by every anime fan. 
 Okay. Yes this was a very-tight-budget movie with continuity errors (like single scenes obviously filmed in sunshine and then in shadow and then mixed together) and as much as I love Nick Mancuso he was often a little too good at the burnt-out part and some of the minor supporting cast was really bad (plus at least one actor was used for two different but conspicuous roles). But come on. Richard Grieco was hysterical (his hair alone is worth the trip). Steven Ford was very likable. Mancuso had some great lines while Nancy Allen ironically was completely bland and uninteresting. Classic? No. Bad parts? Yes. Entertaining? Big yes. I would have loved to have been on-set the day they decided what kind of hairstyle Grieco would have. Are you fast? ... Y'ain't THAT fast.  
 I had seen Lady with Red Hair back when it appeared and didn't remember it as something to cherish. The truth is that notwithstanding its base in a true story its screen play is silly and unbelievable. The real merit of the picture is the cast. A constellation of some of the best supporting players of the 30's and 40's make a background for the delicate intelligent work of the always underrated Miriam Hopkins and the wonderful spectacular performance of Claude Rains who as usual is the best thing in the picture. What an actor! He never won an Oscar but he is in the good company of Chaplin Garbo and Hitchcock. Perhaps Lady with Red Hair contains his best work in films. See it and enjoy him. 
 Let's Bowl started out on local television in the Twin Cities. It came on late at night something you'd stumble across while channel surfing after your 7th bottle of Hamm's. Even the ads were locally produced featuring Wally outside Grumpy's Bar holding a microphone and stammering nervously -- Ahh...over to you Steve Sedahl. Not sure why but that one always made me laugh. There was a bowling contest featured under the guise of settling a dispute between two bowlers but the game was secondary to the commentary and clips. Sedahl played it straight counter-balanced by Rich Kronfeld's bizarre and hilarious Wally Hotvedt. Highlights included segments like How to Properly Dispose of an Old Bowling Ball (chuck them into a lake) and Tips on Dating where the duo date a couple of hookers and Wally ends with the bitter complaint I could have done that myself! Another segment -- what the duo did on their days off -- featured Steve in beer can strewn hovel pigging out from the fridge while Wally struggled to climb the cliffs at Taylor's Falls dressed in his tight pale blue blazer and over-sized headphones. Hilarious! Wally's awestruck comments about league bowlers and his struggle to apply the correct euphemism to various splits were also highlights. Let's Bowl was picked up by Comedy Central and had some good moments but the network never really knew what to do with it running it during prime time and emphasizing the bowling competition which was never the point of the show. The constant commercials interrupted the flow and the side characters (Ernie the Pig Butch etc.) were more distractions than anything else. The whole thing seemed rushed and kind of forced. Even Jon Stewart dissed Let's Bowl on the Daily Show -- (not enough lame snide jokes?) -- an ignominious treatment for a show that deserved far better. How often does a Let's Bowl come along in the world of modern television a locally flavored mix of comedic genius and total crap? The networks have the total crap part down cold but it's a sad thing to watch them kill such a dark strange funny little gem like Let's Bowl. Here's hoping they'll put it out on DVD. 
 I saw this gem of a film at Cannes where it was part of the directors fortnight. Welcome to Collinwood is nothing short of superb. Great fun throughout with all members of a strong cast acting their socks off. It's a sometimes laugh out loud comedy about a petty crook (Cosimo played by Luis Guzman) who gets caught trying to steal a car and sent to prison. While in prison he meets a `lifer' who tells him of `the ultimate bellini' ? which to you and me ? is a sure-fire get rich quick scheme. It turns out that there is a way through from a deserted building into the towns jewellers shop ? which could net millions. Sounds simple? ? well throw in all kinds of wacky characters and incidents along the way and you have got the ingredients for a one wild ride!! ? word passes from one low life loser to the next and soon a team of them are assembled to try and cash in on Cosimos `bellini' lead by failed boxer Pero (Superbly played by Sam Rockwell ? surely a star in the making) and reluctant crook Riley (William H. Macy) who is forced to bring his baby along with him as his wife was locked up for fraud!!. Based on the Italian film I Soliti ignoti (Big Deal on Madonna street) which also inspired a similar film to `Collinwood' ? `Palookaville'. This knocks spots of the latter effort and although its written and directed by the Russo brothers it definitely has shades of the Coen Brothers about it. Produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney who has a small yet hilarious part as a crippled safe breaker. 
 Fifteen years later and Paris Is Burning is still aflame. This is a classic in black gay films right up there with the other honorary black gay films The Color Purple and Mahoganoy. This seminal work captures underground and underclass (i.e. underserved) black and Latin gay culture and community like no other work before or since including all the sentimental Harlem Rennaissance gay retrospectives and renderings. They're good but this is the best (dare I say the only real ) film you'll find on the subject. It's Relentlessy Cunty (the classic house music invention)comes to Hollywood non-stop hilarious camp (like only we do it) and dead-on social critique. All this by a white female director (who obviously must have been a Sister Gurl or Mizz Thing in a former life.) I could go on but I think you get the point by now: I love this movie! 
 I wasn't alive in the 60's so I can't guarantee that this movie was a completely accurate representation of the period but it is certainly a moving and fulfilling experience. There are some excellent performances most notably by Josh Hamilton (of With Honors) Jerry O'Connell (Sliders) who play brothers divided by the war. Bill Smitrovich a character actor who has been long ignored by many gives a heart-filled performance as their strict father who is forced to question his own beliefs and values as one of his sons makes him proud by going to Vietnam but returns empty inside while the other is exactly the opposite. All in all this is a powerful and heartwarming film that I hope everyone gets a chance to experience. 
 I have probably seen this movie over fifty times by now because of the kids they just cant get enough of Spirit. The best thing about the movie I think is that the animals isn't able to talk this makes the whole movie more honest and makes a better impression on both kids and the adults so 10/10 from the kids and me 
 I saw the movie recently and really liked it. I surprised myself and cried. This movie is in the same niche genre as Away from Her - or even The Bucket List but handles the whole aging theme with incredible authenticity. It's really really tough to have the main character as unlikable as Hagar. The director does a masterful job with the challenge. Hagar's hard to understand. Her world has hard edges and she isn't a warm endearing woman at all. The first scene gets this across without any compromise. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter-in-law. She figures it out en-route and freaks out. Her edges are really hard. She is mean. She is belittling and selfish. She is a stone. I didn't like her - not even a little bit. Throughout the course of the movie we get insight. We find out why she doesn't like petunias why she favors one son over the other how her losses have formed her character... I started to see the angel... and I started to like her. I especially liked her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the shack. Ellen Burnstyn you are a brilliant actor. Kudos. Kudos. Kudos. What a scene! This isn't a feel good movie but it is certainly a movie that brings the viewer to empathy. I understand more clearly that hard edges in a person's life are there to protect they are there for a reason... Hagar isn't my mother - she isn't even my mother-in-law or neighbor... but parts of her are present in many women (and men) in my life. Those parts somehow make more sense to me now that I've watched The Stone Angel. 
 This is a clever episode of TWILIGHT ZONE that was comic rather than strange or tragic. Buster Keaton is Woodrow Mulligan a janitor from 1890 America works in a laboratory. He is constantly griping about the life problems around him: meat is too expensive (it's like $1.00 / lb. Unheard of!). He is always yelling after crazy speeders (on bicycles - autos haven't appeared yet). Griping to the end he sees a helmet like device by a scientist and puts it on and tries it. Suddenly he is in modern America. The beginning was a seven minute silent film. Now it is all noise all talking all beeping all blowing. Keaton is here only a few minutes when he realizes that the world has changed and not for the better. He runs into Stanley Adams a Professor Rollo who realizes that Mulligan is from c. 1890 (he mentions President Cleveland). Rollo has always wanted to live in that charming quiet age. He helps Mulligan get the helmet repaired and they go back in time. Rollo gets bored after awhile due to the lack of scientific equipment that he can use. Mulligan puts the helmet on him and sends him into the future. But now Woodrow is fully content with the quiet simple age he lives in. He has found contentment. In his last fifteen years Buster Keaton was frequently on television (many times for Allan Funt on CANDID CAMERA where he could help set up sight gag tricks on the public). He did make a few films as well (most notably A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO THE FORUM and THE RAILRODDER). But he occasionally popped up in television plays and episodes. He is in his element here presumably advising the director (old comedy film director Norman McLeod - he directed the Marx Brothers in HORSE FEATHERS) on the tricks he could do. Watch how Stanley Adams and he time Adams picking him up when he is snatching a pair of trousers he needs. In terms of timing it reminds one of gags he did in the 20s in films like SHERLOCK JR. The episode does show Keaton in fine fettle for a man in his sixties. The appearances of Jesse White (here as a repairman of all things) is always welcome. But look a bit at Professor Rollo . Stanley Adams was a well known figure in movies and television from the 1950s onward to his tragic suicide in 1977. Plump with unkempt appearance and heavy booming voice his best known dramatic role was as the wrestling promoter in the film version of REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT (he wants Anthony Quinn to be a wrestler wearing a costume as an Indian). His best known television appearance was as the space trader who introduces the crew of the Starship Enterprise in STAR TREK to those furry fertile little creatures Tribbles (as in The Trouble With ). Adams was always worth watching (like Jesse White and certainly like Keaton) enhancing most of the productions he appeared in. I have never understood his suicide but it was a sad end to a first rate character performer. 
 All of the people reviewing this film and probably many professional film reviewers just don't get it. This film was made with matting sequences and art techniques quite like the works of the great Czech filmmaker Karel Zeman. If you want to know what I'm talking about I suggest you get any of Zeman's films such as The Fabulous World of Jules Verne Baron Munchausen Journey to the Beginning of Time or On The Comet. If you are unable to locate a film then read the reviews in AMG. They will explain the processes used. If one were to look at Zeman's work and try to compare it to any of the other sci/fi fantasy films of the time viewers probably wouldn't have gotten it then either. It is unfair to compare either of these filmmakers' styles to the standard technologies of the day because both Zemen and Hines do not compute . They have a style that is unique to them and should be judged for their creativity only. If you look at this film from a perspective where you KNOW that he intentionally tried to create a pastiche collage of mattes mixed with live action you could easily come to the conclusion that he did a masterful job. It isn't easy making a bunch of computer cutouts flow. I thought that the creatures were also quite good also considering how they were made. Hines took a great gamble and I think his film will not be fairly judged for years to come. Someone promoting the film should have tipped the audience off as to what they would be seeing rather than let them blindly go into the theater expecting the usual CG work. Regarding the actors I think Hines also took a page from Zemen's book in that many of Zemen's actors were somewhat expressionless at first but became much more engaging as the film and action went on. It is totally refreshing to me to have this movie in my library. I will watch it for years to come all three great hours of it. 
 Rachel McAdams. Cillian Murphy. Wes Craven. The Dream Team. This is one of the best thrillers of 2005. A great plot. A great twist. A great eye candy. This is one of Wes Craven's greatest movies apart from Scream and A Nightmare on Elm Street . This could be the best. The plot is one of the best things about the movie and it is very simple. Lisa Reisert (McAdams) a struggling hotel manager boards a late Red Eye back to LA. Little does she know that she has been followed by Jackson Ripner AKA Jack the Ripper (Murphy). They have a couple of drinks and end up sitting together on the plane. Later he reveals to her that he is an assassin who was sent to kill the Secreteary of Homeland Security who is staying in Lisa's hotel. And what does this have to with Lisa. Well she would have to move his room to the top suite so they can bomb him if she doesn't Ripner will murder her father (Brian Cox). The twist and bringing of the story really gives it the extra zing and the side characters and the side jokes really add to it. Overall definitely one of the best thrillers of 2005. Definitely worth the see. 3 1/2 out of 4 stars 
 To put it simply I enjoyed this film. The reason for my interest & enjoyment was not related to anything other than the subject matter itself. I had heard tales from my mother and grandmother about how Northern England working class life and attitudes used to be (as experienced by them)and this is an interesting depiction that seems to faithfully represent what they told me. In particular the paternalistic but overbearing father who knows what is best for his family along with his stubborness when this paradigm is challenged. (Not much has changed there then!!) People who have seen the play will probably be disappointed with the film because the story does not easily transfer across the different media. In a sense however the film is an historical document and I personally enjoyed it if only because of the way it conveyed a social phenomenon. 
 the only word that sums up this movie is quirky. it's a light-hearted romp through an existential concept. bouncy (in more way than one) and a bit nutty. i wouldn't exactly call it grand and unforgettable cinema and it doesn't seem quite as memorable as the director's first movie cube but it's a good pit of fluff to watch on a Sunday morning. the acting veers from respectable to annoying at times but i believe that's how it was to be written. done as a serious movie it could perhaps have been great or may very well have stepped into a state of pretension. a little like the matrix meets head meets human nature . 6.8 out of ten 
 I am currently on vacation in Israel for summer and so was able to see this incredible film. A bit of a warning before I begin writing: I speak fluent Hebrew and so the Hebrew parts were no problem; however about a quarter (a bit less) of the film is in Arabic and I was unable to understand a bit of this subtitled bit. This did not detract from my understanding of the film but did cause me to miss a few jokes which evoked some strong laughs in the theater. After a year of American Cinema which many hailed as one of the greatest years for homosexual cinema and relationships it takes something truly special to stand head and shoulders above the rest; yet The Bubble surpasses all others with its blend of excellent acting witty dialogue and relevant political climate. The film opens on a checkpoint on the Israeli-Palestinian border; For the first few moments we are unsure about the type of movie we have walked in on. Yet this is an important element of this film's strength. The political situation and the extreme tension in the air is constantly in the background. Most importantly Tel Aviv serves as a character of its own in this film. It is constantly referenced. Street names and restaurant names are constantly exchanged. The skyline and city development is critiqued quite harshly and ultimately the city evolves along with the film The film focuses on the love between Noam (Ohad Knoller) and a Palestinian immigrant Ashraf(Yousef 'Joe' Sweid) with the societies of Tel Aviv and Palestine serving as a constant foil. We always know that their relationship is forbidden and this creates a sense of urgency rarely present in cinema. The love is incredibly strong and stands as the centerpiece of the film. The secondary relationships and friendships are equally strong: flamboyant restaurant owner Yelli's ( Yousef 'Joe' Sweid) relationship with the ultra-butch and grating golani solider Golan (Zohar Liba) is particularly a source of amusement. The love scenes which abound in this film are all exquisite fine crafted works of art and the cinematography is astounding: In the first love scene of the film the camera pans down as a male character gives oral sex to Lulu (Daniela Virtzer) and dissolves into a shot of Noam and Ashraf. This shot any many others lead the viewer to realize that all of these relationships are expressions of the very same form of love. To give away more of the storyline would be a tragedy but know that there is a lot of political tension and tragedy which touches onto the current world political climate so I will instead focus on the witty dialogue. Even when watching this movie in my second language I could not stop laughing throughout. Lines of particular amusement include the question of whether gay suicide bombers receive virgin women or men in heaven and an analogy of Sampson from the bible as the worlds first suicide bomber. This dialogue shows a particular sense of purity and reality which is rarely seen in Cinema. The music used in the film is also particularly powerful. Music is only used in times when characters legitimately could or should be listening to it and in one scene the music weakens when a character removes one earphone and stops when he removes the other. Little elements like this truly elevate the film. I could not give greater recommendation to a film; this is a superb work of cinema which is catharthic as well as extremely well crafted. 
 H.G. Wells in 1936 was past his prime and the books of his that will survive were long gone by. He was coming to the end of his life and he was confronted to his dream gone sour. At the very beginning of the 20th century he defended the idea that the world was doomed because the evolution of species natural biology on one side and Marxism market economy on the other side were necessarily leading to the victory of the weaker over the stronger due to the simple criterion of number. The weaker were the mass of humanity and the stronger were the minority elite. He defended then a strict eugenic policy with the elimination of all those who were in a way or another weakening the human race. First of all the non-Caucasian with the only exception of the Jews who would disappear thanks to mixed marriages. Then within the Caucasian community all those who were not healthy the alcoholics the mentally disabled all those who were genetically disabled etc. That was not Hitler. That was H.G. Wells and that was not after the first world war. That was more than ten years before. And twenty years before the first world war he had published The Time Machine that defended the idea that the human race left to its own means and due to the vaster cosmological evolution of life on earth would see the differentiation of the human race into two species : the working class would become a subterranean laborious species and the bourgeoisie would become an idle surface species. The point was in the novel that the surface sophisticated and weak idle species was the prey of the other species who were the predators. Wells was convinced humanity was in danger and politicians were supposed to stop this evolution by imposing a strict eugenic policy. The first countries to follow this injunction were the Scandinavian countries who were also the last to drop it only very recently for some of them. The film here proposes a vision of 2036 with a world government that is absolutely dictatorial in the fact that there is no election no parliament no really democratic institution only peace imposed by military conquest and the government is dominated by one man or at the most one man and his few councilors. And in that future world all absolutely all human beings are Caucasians. Wells was able to imagine humanity being completely white by 2036. Amazing. Wells envisaged some kind of a rebellion but that would be short lived and lead to nothing at all. The last sentences are the vision of this white civilization conquering the whole universe when contemplating the sky and its stars and planets. Frightening. And that was produced in 1936. All the more frightening since nowhere the slightest mention of Hitlerism fascism Japanese imperialism or Stalinism can be found. But it is essential to have that film in a good restored edition because it is crucial to have a full vision of H.G. Wells. We are obviously very far away from the Brave New World of absolute democratic social selection or the Animal Farm of the dictatorship of the porcine proletariat or the 1984 of the abstract mediatic dictatorship of Big Brother. This vision is at least just as much frightening as the three others. And I only want to compare Wells with the British science fiction writers of his days. It would be unfair to go beyond. This reveals that in England in these first three decades of the 20th century there was a tremendous fear among intellectuals: the fear that the future would only be somber bleak and in the form of an impasse of some kind.

 I too have gone thru very painful personal loss (Twice) and this movie portrays the gut wrenching reality of that experience very well Life out of balance nothing makes sense well meaning relatives etc... It was nice to see Ally again. She is one of my all time favorite movie actors. I laughed and cried as the story unfolded. Great story and cast. Well done! 
 Although there were a few rough spots and some plot lines that weren't exactly true to character this was Classic H:LOTS. The characters outside of Mike Giardello (Giancarlo Esposito) were true to form and the reunion scenes of Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) were as deep and well acted as anything ever to grace the small screen. Homicide: The Movie aka Life Everlasting is a fan flick but stands on its own as well as any 2-hour episode of the series. Fontana Overmeyer and Yoshimura did a wonderful job in pulling loose ends from 7 seasons and every major cast member of the best damn show on television together for the series finale that NBC never bothered to give it. True to Homicide form there were no happy endings such is life. That's what has always set this show apart from the mindless cookie-cutter cop shows left on television. Kudos to the writers and the cast for creating something over the span of the series and in the movie that challenged television viewers and producers alike. ** I call myself a Homicidal Maniac if for no other reason than to keep my co-workers in a cooperative mood. ** 
 Russell my fav is gorgeous in this film. But more than that the film covers a tremendous range of human passion and sorrow. Everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected. The film makes the viewer realize that tolerance of other humans provides the route to saving humanity. Fabulous love story between Lachlin and Lil. I replay their scenes over and over again. Anyone who has ever been in love will empathize with these people. All characters are cast and portrayed excellently. 
 If you see this movie you know you will see an extense video-clip of popular music. But you will find more. Incredible FX great music and a nice time to enjoy with your kids. If you compare this movie you have to remember is a pop extravaganza. Clips of Man In The Mirror Leave Me Alone Smooth Criminal and Beatles' Come Together . 
 When I was a kid it was Lex Barker's time as Tarzan. I often heard from older people that Johnny Weissmuller was Tarzan and I wouldn't understand why since I saw a couple of Weismuller's last films in the character and I thought he was sort of out of shape. It wasn't after many years that I came across Tarzan and His Mate and then I understood. Weismuller is in shape in this picture and has the presence and rugged looks the character demands not matched yet by other Tarzans such as Barker Gordon Scott Jock Mahoney Denny Miller Miles O'Keefe and Cristopher Lambert. As for this film I was also surprised by the sensual presence of beautiful Maureen O'Sullivan a strong self minded active and no-inhibitions woman as Jane way ahead of the times in which the film was made (Tarzan pushes her into a pond naked as she is amused; one of the explorers kisses her by surprise and though she doesn't kiss him back she sort of let him do for a bit and makes no big deal out of it); such behaviors were unthinkable with the Janes to come such as Brenda Joyce Vanessa Brown Virginia Huston or Dorothy Hart all playing sort of too perfect sweet vulnerable women making it hard to believe they could survive in a hostile place like the African jungle. O'Sullivan character's sparkling personality steals the show out of Tarzan himself except of course when it comes to action and Weismuller takes the lead easily; the combination is perfect. Another highlight in the movie is Cheeta's secondary role and not as the main lead like in later Tarzan pictures where she often saves the day. Tarzan and His Mate stands as a fine product in its genre (Tarzan films) and perhaps as the best though I have to admit that I also enjoyed Tarzan's Greatest Adventure (1959) made with a higher budget and a strong supporting cast (and in spite of the just acceptable Gordon Scott in the leading role with his too perfect all gymnasium physical looks that doesn't fit for a rustic ape man). Good for Jane and her mate! 
 Although this film is somewhat filled with eighties cheese i have a place for it in my DVD rack and i don't know why. I think i like it because the moral of the story is 'television is garbage so turn it off and go and get a life'. For those of you who do decide to heed the message then you should try reading the book its nothing like the film at all. To ruin it for you at the end of the story a fatally wounded Richards ends up crashing a plane into the network building killing himself everyone inside and shutting down the network at the same time. I read it many years ago but today it would hard not to compare it to 9/11. 
 I remember watching this film a while ago and after seeing 3000 miles to Graceland it all came flooding back. Why this hasn't had a Video or DVD release yet? It's sacrilegious that this majesty of movie making has never been released while other rubbish has been. In fact this is the one John Carpenter film that hasn't been released. In fact i haven't seen it on the TV either since the day i watched it. Kurt Russell was the perfect choice for the role of Elvis. This is definitely a role he was born to play. John carpenter's break from horror brought this gem that i'd love the TV to play again. It is well acted and well performed as far as the singing goes. Belting out most of Elvis's greatest hits with gusto. I think this also was the film that formed the partnership with Russell and Carpenter which made them go on to make a number of great movies (Escape from New York The Thing Big trouble in little china and Escape from L.A. Someone has got to release this before someone does a remake or their own version of his life which i feel would not only tarnish the king but also ruin the magic that this one has. If this doesn't get released then we are gonna be in Heartbreak Hotel. 
 This is a really interesting movie. It is an action movie with comedy mixed in. Foxx teams up with comedian Epps in this movie to give it a comedic spin. It will keep you wondering whats going to happen to Foxx next. It was a well shot movie the director used the right colors in this movie(dark blue colors) to give it the right kind of feel. Kimberly Elise also starred in this movie and it is always a pleasure to see her on the big screen. She plays her role well. Even Jamie Kennedy is in this movie. It's worth seeing it you haven't seen it. It's definitely worth having if you are a Jamie Foxx fan. It deserves more credit than it is actually given. 
 Such a masterpiece as the first of these two Snowy River films was the sequel to The Man From Snowy River is everything that a follow-up should be. It does not tread on the toes of its predecessor preferring to leave the legend that was the first film live on in some unique immortality. The Man From Snowy River II is based upon the return of Jim Craig to the Snowy River country after a three year absence. The film subtly tells a tale of change in the nineteenth century of Australian history legend and horses. The storyline demonstrates a touch of Hollywood in lighter shades an aspect that was absolutely absent in the first film yet this blends uniquely with the a distinct sense of Australian patriotism. The plot is far more vibrant than the first film and much more showy with particular aspects of the previous incorporated into the film yet The Man From Snowy River II possesses every essential characteristic of the first film; sensationally beautiful cinematography a stunning focus of the Australian high country the second most impressive footage of horses ever filmed and a fantastic and deeply moving soundtrack by Bruce Rowland which equals the first in every way. Geoff Burrowes has done a superb job with this film and it is highly worthy of recognition especially with regard to the quality of the Australian Film Industry. The lead cast from Tom Burlinson to Sigrid Thornton and a well-replaced Brian Dennehy carry off their parts with as much passion and distinction as the first film. As far as sequels can go The Man From Snowy River II is a masterpiece; a deeply moving and inspirational experience yet again. 
 Five years on from the Tenko survivors returning home and from Marion's double-edged Well that's that . It's now 1950: reunion time. The gang's all here: Marion Bea Ulrica Kate Dorothy Christina Dominica and latecomers Maggie and Alice. The story that unfolds is a beaut: as perfectly written and acted and as thought-provoking and moving as the original series. All the questions left hanging at the end of the series are neatly answered here. From Marion's family to Joss's health centre everything has changed in five years and not everything has changed for the best. A trip to Dominica's plantation brings plenty of shocks and some truly edge-of-the-seat tension. There's a real sense of tragedy and disaster as once again fate takes over and the women struggle for their lives. Dominica finally shows her true colours and there are some shout-at-the-telly moments of drama. Lush location filming in Singapore and an opportunity to catch up with a group of women who feel like they have become friends. It's such a shame that this really is the end. I could watch it all over again. Perfection. 
 I saw the description of the movie on TCM and only let it run because I like both Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith so I was delightfully surprised to find that I really liked the movie and found it quite exceptional. Of course it is seriously dated but as a period piece it is well worth watching just for the subtle humour in insight into life and lifestyle almost forty years ago. Now the only problem is trying to find it on DVD so I can watch it more often. I also was quite taken with the performances of Smith and Ustinov as the leads and of Karl Malden Bob Newhart and the cameo appearances by Robert Morley and Cesar Romero. 
 The Hanson brothers - Andy (apparently has his act together) and Hank (clearly doesn't have his act together) need money. Andy comes up with a scheme to get some dough that will have consequences for the whole Hanson family. This film delivers. This is a layered full-blooded roller coaster ride that knows exactly what it is doing. As a crime drama / thriller I would happily compare it to 'No Country For Old Men.' While both films have have an ample supply of character drama and thrills 'Devil' is more on the thriller side because of its fast pace. 'No Country' is a colder and bleaker film that you can really admire while 'Devil' is a bit more enjoyable. There is definitely less violence in 'Devil' than 'No Country.' The acting delivers as well. Ethan Hawke sometimes wooden in the past brings the jitters sweating and the deer-in-the-headlights-look to the besieged Hank. Philip Seymour Hoffman as Andy has the film's hardest scenes and is fast becoming the actor who you believe can do anything. There's really not much wrong with this film. It jumps back and forth without being confusing. Events spiral out of control but the film never does - the writing (from first timer Kelly Masterson) directing (veteran Sidney Lumet) and the editing stay as tight as a drum. In many categories this is award caliber stuff though maybe films like 'The Departed' and 'No Country' squeezed this one out of the limelight. If you liked those you'll like this. 
 Well I would consider Police Story as one of Jackie Chan's best film. The plot the fighting scenes and the stunt works are excellent. In this film Jackie himself acted as a police officer called Chan Ka Kui (Kevin Chan in some versions) who successfully arrested a crime lord. After the crime lord was released due to lack of evidence he framed Chan for the killing of a police officer. Due to this he became wanted by the police. Later on Salina (Brigitte Lin) who was the secretary of the crime lord went to a shopping mall and started to steal the evidence of the crime lord's crimes from his computer and preparing to pass them to Chan. However the crime lord knew that Salina had downloaded his incriminating data and hired his henchmen to capture her. Later on Chan appeared at the scenes and began to fight all of the henchmen defeating them one by one. At the last scene Chan was seen punching the crime lord. Lastly this is the best action and comedy movie. Everyone should watch it. Highly recommended. 
 A movie/documentary about different people in Austria on the hottest weekend of the year. It follows what they are doing and maybe more what they are not doing. The tempo is very quiet......so you have to relax.......breathe in...breathe out before you see it...... First you think....but nothing is happening and you get a little angry over that..and thats the problem because its the mood of the film and the really nice social realistic pictures which are nice in this film...........a lot of people will say its disgusting......but its not that bad...i think its more used for the marketing....and theres some really funny moments...a 60 old woman stripping.....i guarantee its the most unsexy striptease in film history......its movie which is real..i think thats the word......right up in your face.......and that makes it a bit scary.no computer manipulation here.....its real life...and as we all know movies can win over reality when it comes to doing sick things..........so its much worse in the real world....... If you survive the movie you can start to look at your neighbors and think...maybe they are like the persons in the movie...i bet theres a lot of them out there......sick...crazy people living with a nice facade........after seing the movie i feel its more interesting to look at my neighbors........ But maybe you shouldnt see this movie on your first date......... 
 I have to agree with Cal-37 it's a great movie specially for the family Kelly Linch is beautiful the little girl is really talented and cute of course Jim Belushi has earned his strips! But want I really liked was the piano song if you're a musician or not watch this movie just for that you'll know which it is. You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You Written by Russ Morgan Larry Stock and James Cavanaugh So have fun watching See ya Nelson 
 I've seen a lot of TV movies in my time as a student the majority the normal waste of time that US television throws out. This one however was well crafted and plotted and had a very nice twist at the end. Having only seen Richard Dean Anderson in MacGyver and Stargate I was surprised with his excellent performance rather than the rather gamut of expressions from A-B that he normally gives. It was a pleasant surprise to see Daphne Zuniga after quite a long time dating back to The Fly II. Also nice to see Robert Guillaumme in a leading role again. I can't say that I ever take Jane Leeves seriously after her Benny Hill days but she just about managed to cope well in her role. All in all a highly recommended film. 
 Citizen X tells the real life drama of the search for a serial killer dubbed The Rostov Ripper This great film shows the long journey it took to try to apprehend a killer. The film shows how politics may haver helped the killer to continue his rampage for over 12 years. (Possibly over 50 victims mostly women and children) The performances of Stephen Rea as the lead detective and Donald Sutherland as the overall investigation lead was superb. Jeffrey DeMunn as the Ripper Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo. This is the type of film which will mesmerize you and immediately have you on the internet researching the real case. This a film not to be missed. It debuted I believe on HBO and never did get a theatrical release to my understanding. Great film 
 I was also on hand for the premiere in Toronto. This film was sort of a consolation when I thought I wouldn't be able to get in to see my first choice. Well I was totally blown away. By the time I got to the theater I could remember little other than the basic plot of the movie (yes I actually forgot who was even in it.) Terrific performances from the entire cast. Carrie-Anne Moss was great in a true departure from her days as Trinity. As for Billy Connolly I think not since Chaplin has an actor played so brilliantly with no lines what-so-ever. The kids were also great. Definitely check this one out if you get the chance. And by the way I got to see my first choice anyway- and this was way better. 
 I like the good and evil battle. I liked Eddie in this movie better than any movie he has ever done. He wasn't The smart cocky know it all he usually plays. He shows heart and a more humble humor. The fact that it shows there are stranger things in Heaven and on earth than we can think of gives me hope. 
 Telefilms tend to fall under the pitfalls of a low budget and a hasty shooting schedule which is why this film always tends to buck the trend. George C. Scott embodies Ebenezer Scrooge perfectly fully encompassing all of his cold tendencies and still makes him a simpathetic character. The production value for this film was exceptional never relying on boffo special effects or soundstage set-ups yet relying on the depth and clarity of on-site shooting and strong backdrops. A movie that certainly stands alone. 
 This was excellent. Touching action-packed and perfect for Kurt Russel. I loved this movie it deserves more than 5.3 or so stars. This movie is the story of an obsolete soldier who learns there is more to life than soldiering and people who learn that there is a time for fighting a need to defend. I cried laughed and mostly sat in awe of this story. Good writing job for an action flick and the plot was appropriate and fairly solid. The ending wasn't twisty but it was still excellent. If you like escape from New York or rooting for the underdog this movie is for you. Not an undue amount of gore or violence it was not difficult to watch in that respect. Something for everyone. 
 Before Sunrise has many remarkable things going on almost too many to fit into one review like this but it's suffice to say that it's one of the most observant character studies of the nineties maybe even in all of contemporary cinema to be observant not about love per-say so much as it's about a human connection. How does one fall in love at first sight? No one does at least that's deep down the consensus that Linklater wants to show with his film. And *yet* there is the possibility of as intense a connection of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time. Linklater here gives us the story of Celine and Jessie a French girl and an American boy who get off the same train heading to Vienna and on the way there start to talking about things at first arbitrary then personal (Jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather). Jessie persuades Celine to go along with him on a night out on the 'town' in Vienna until his plane the next morning. Before Sunrise gives Jessie and Celine in the midst of the gorgeous Vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance and in a sense is about the act of having conversations of what it's like to watch people having one leading into another and another. Here it's often about relationships and commitments as Jessie and Celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential or seemingly so and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities. We hear confessions of desires for other loves or what weren't really loves of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you'll love your life of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul (I loved the bit about the quakers in the church) and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism. Jessie may be more responsible for that last part but what's fascinating about the film is that it's never exactly cynical itself just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives. Meanwhile it's always great to see Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in these roles where they're not incessantly annoying in that 90s Generation-X mode but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film which isn't a bad one at all but a necessary one one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere. The conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala Brief Encounter only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other where sweet asides are actually acceptable ( I have to tell you a secret Jessie says and then leans in for a kiss ho-ho) or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way. I loved the scene with the poet where it's very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal or with the palm reader and how the reactions from Jessie and Celine are that we might share but really are seeing them do it first-hand. All the while Hawke and Delpy embody the roles interestingly- we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives- as it may lead off into the future... Featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness however self-contained as it may lead into something more. Who's to say you can't suddenly be attached to someone if only for less than 24 hours and be that much more attached than a married couple? This is perhaps Linklater's thesis but there's more to it than just that. It's a very dense film and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly. One scene especially which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking 'on the phone' in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the other's friend. A+

 This was a very well scripted movie. Great fun if you just want a stupid film. Not great production value (ok the sound really sucked) but the performance of Danny Masterson more than makes up for it. Watch this movie and laugh out loud! 
 FULL HOUSE in my opinion is an absolute ABC classic! I'm not sure if I've never seen every episode but I still enjoyed it. One of my favorite episodes is where Jesse (John Stamos) and Rebecca (Lori Loughlin) get married. If you want to know how what made it so funny you'd have to have seen it for yourself. It was a two-parter so you'd have to have seen both parts. Another one of my favorite episodes is where Jesse Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary Kate & Ashley Olsen) get locked in a gas station on Michelle's birthday. You'd also have to have seen it for yourself if you want to know how and why that happened. I have many other ones that I like too. Everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were well-designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion even though it can be seen in syndication now I strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good. 
 The first of two Jim Thompson adaptations released in 1990 (the other being the more well-known GRIFTERS) AFTER DARK has all of Thompson's hallmarks: dangerous women the confidence game and characters that are either not as dim as others suspect them of being or not as harmless. Jason Patric is superb as a former boxer disqualified from the sport for life due to an incident in the ring (director James Foley uses RAGING BULL-esquire sequences to flesh out the back story) and the too-little-seen Rachel Ward also delivers a great performance. But Bruce Dern is the film's secret weapon: his sweet-talking grifter Uncle Bud subtly commands each of his scenes. there's almost no comic relief in this film so watch it prepared to be sucked into the void. 
 This is a run-of-the-mill nature porn movie. By porn I don't mean sex. I mean gratuitous images of (for example) thousands of birds together or hundreds of walruses or a giant waterfall or iceberg. Several of the shots in the film seem to exist solely to make their way into the trailer to get people into theatres to see it for all of ten seconds before it disappears never to be seen again for the rest of the film. There is almost no plot in this film. Told to expect a story of three animal families better than March of the Penguins the movie simply doesn't deliver. The blame rests in three key areas: (1) the writers who gave James Earl Jones some of the worst lines to narrate in nature film history (2) the music team who over-dramatized everything to tell you what you should be feeling even when the film fails to motivate and lastly but most importantly (3) the editors who had the story jump from place to place with no rhyme or reason no continuity no flow sucking the life out of the entire film -- a film about life. When we got to the whales halfway through the film I sunk back in my seat with dread hoping against hope that the film was more than halfway through and that I'd be able to survive the long endurance test along with the animals on screen. There was also almost no science in the film at all. They attributed hot and cold (all of it not just the seasons) solely to the Earth's tilt ignoring the fact that we'd have even greater extremes from location to location if there was no tilt because the poles would never warm. And it would be worst if we had no rotation (relative to revolution) like Mercury because half the planet would bake and the other half would freeze. Then near the end they used the phrase humans and animals as if humans are not animals somehow exempt from the laws of nature. So much for science. I must credit the camera work however and again that is why I call this nature porn. Everything from super-slow-motion to what appears to be a finely-tuned mechanically-controlled time-lapse photography was put to use to provide some (and I caution only some ) stunning moments that do raise the bar compared to other nature films. That said I am not convinced that it was all nature on the screen. Some of the shots showing the great watering hole in Africa as it changed from season to season seemed like CGI to me. A director might have expected such suspicion and built in other shots to demonstrate that it's all natural but they didn't do that. For a film about Earth I had expected a lot more of Earth to be shown. What we saw was pristine. We had to take the narrator's word for it that some species are at risk due to climate changes. They didn't show us evidence of it. They didn't show us Alberta's poisonous tailing ponds visible from space. They didn't show us the great Pacific trash whorl. They didn't show us a nighttime picture of human light pollution around the planet. These are as much Earth as anything else. Why cover it up for a feel-good whitewash? My last criticism of the content is of predation. Any time a predator was shown on the screen actually hunting prey the music turned almost into that Mt Doom scene from Lord of the Rings with the predator portrayed as some kind of Sauron ultimate-evil character. But predators aren't evil. They perform a necessary service ensuring that the best members of the prey species survive. We are predators ourselves. Any time the predator caught the prey we immediately cut away to something else to sort of pretend that death and eating don't really happen. The final insult was the dad polar bear being left to die after he dared to try to eat. Bad bear! Bad! you can almost hear them say. On to the presentation itself. My theatre may be in part to blame for this but maybe not. I had expected to see something with greater clarity than I could see on my own HDTV LCD at home. But the picture was blurry and was presented in the same 16:9 ratio I could get at home instead of the wider ratio many films come in these days. And during one action-packed scene near the end the film (I can't imagine this happening digitally from how it looked) was damaged and we lost several of the colors eventually blacking out completely. That repeated about three times. If they actually do plant a tree on my behalf it will have been worth it. But how will I know? 
 Finally a movie where the audience is kept guessing until the end what will happen. Well we all kind of know that the lives of the brothers Andy (played by Hoffman) and Hank (played by Hawke) will spiral downward towards destruction since where else is there to go but down but we do not know how or when until near the end of the movie. Hoffman is superb as usual and even Hawke was decent as the younger brother who basically does what he is told since he really cannot think for himself. Hawke might have been a little out of his element but he played the part well enough. Add into this mix Andy's wife played perfectly by Marisa Tomei cheating with Hank; Andy's embezzlement of company funds to pay for his drug and sex addictions; and a father who finally discovers exactly what happened the day of the robbery. This movie will get you thinking. 
 This is a great movie for all ages. Its the story about three animals how have to find their way home. There is a bit of a twist at the end and mainly throughout the whole movie. You never know what is going to happen next. This movie makes you cry and makes you laugh. You just don't know what going to happen next. The trek home is all beautiful with all the wonderful wildlife scenes. They producers also spent a lot of money for this movie and it shows too. The animals in this movie were well trained and are great actors/actress themselves. Everything about this movie is great! 10 out of 10 the whole way! Rent or buy it today I can guarantee you will love it the whole family will! 
 Gojoe is part of a new wave of Japanese cinema taking very creative directors editors and photographers and working on historic themes what the Japanese call period pieces . Gojoe is extremely creative in terms of color photography and editing. Brilliant even. The new wave of Japanese samurai films allows a peek at traditional beliefs in shamanism demons and occult powers that were certainly a part of their ancient culture but not really explored in Kurosawa's samurai epics or the Zaitochi series. Another fine example of this genre is Onmyoji (2001). I would place director Sogo Ichii as one of the most interesting and creative of the new wave Japanese directors. Other recent Japanese period pieces I would highly recommend include Yomada's Twilight Samurai (2002) and Shintaro Katsu's Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman (2003). 
 Laurence Olivier Merle Oberon Ralph Richardson and Binnie Barnes star in The Divorce of Lady X a 1938 comedy based on a play. Olivier plays a young barrister Everard Logan who allows Oberon to spend the night in his hotel room when the London fog is too dense for guests at a costume ball to go home. The next day a friend of his Lord Mere (Richardson) announces that his wife (Barnes) spent the night with another man at the same hotel and he wants to divorce her. Believing the woman to be Oberon Olivier panics. Oberon who is single and the granddaughter of a judge pretends that she's the lady in question Lady Mere when she's really Leslie Steele. We've seen this plot or variations thereof dozens of time. With this cast it's delightful. I mean Richardson and Olivier? Olivier and Oberon that great team in Wuthering Heights? Pretty special. Olivier is devastatingly handsome and does a great job with the comedy as he portrays the uptight nervous barrister. Oberon gives her role the right light touch. She looks extremely young here fuller in the face with Jean Harlow eyebrows and a very different hairdo for her. She wears some beautiful street clothes though her first gown looks like a birthday cake and in one gown she tries on with that hair-do she's ready to play Snow White. Binnie Barnes is delightful as the real Lady Mere. The color in this is a mess and as others have mentioned it could really use a restoration. Definitely worth seeing. 
 Anna (Charlotte Burke) develops a strange fever that causes her to pass out and drift off into a world of her own creation. A bleak world she drew with a sad little boy as the inhabitant of an old dumpy house in the middle of a lonely field. Lacking in detail much like any child drawing the house and it's inhabitant Marc (who can't walk because Anna didn't draw him any legs) are inhabitants of this purgatory/limbo world. Anna begins visiting the boy and the house more frequently trying to figure what's what and in the process tries to help save the boy but her fever is making it harder for her to wake up each time and may not only kill her but trap her and Marc there forever. Wow! Is a good word to sum up Bernard Rose's brilliantly haunting and poetic Paperhouse. A film that is so simple that it's damn near impossible to explain and impossible to forget. While you may find this puppy in your horror section it's anything but. It's more of a serious fantasy expertly directed and exceptionally well acted by it's cast in particular Charlotte Burke and Elliot Speirs (Marc). And yet it's not a children's movie either but meant to make us remember those carefree days of old that are now just dark memories. Rose creates a rich tapestry of moody ambiance that creates a thrilling backdrop for the brilliant story and great actors to play with. Paperhouse stays away from trying to explain it's more dreamy qualities and leaves most things to the viewers imagination. There's much symbolism and ambiguity here to sink your teeth into. Paperhouse enjoys playing games with the viewers mind engrossing you with it's very own sense of reasoning. As the story unfolded I was again and again impressed at just how powerful the film managed to be up to the finale which left me with a smile on my face and a tear in my eye. Bernard Rose's visuals are brilliant here. He's able to create an unnervingly bleak atmosphere that appears simple on the surface but as a whole is much greater than the sum of it's parts. The acting is of young Charlotte Burke in this her feature debut is a truly impressing as well. Unfortunately she's not graced the screen since. A much deserved Burnout Central award only seems proper for that performance. Toward the end the movie lags a bit here and there but I was easily able to overlook it. I wished they had took a darker turn creating a far more powerful finale that would have proved to be all the more unnerving and truly riveting in retrospect. The movie as is is still one for the books and deserves to be seen by any serious film lover. It's a poetic ride told through the innocent eyes of a child a powerful film in which much is left to be pondered and far more to be praised. 
 If you want to be cynical and pedantic you could point out that the opening where a RAF Lancaster bomber is mortally wounded on the 2nd of May 1945 is somewhat unlikely since German air defences were as lively as Adolph Hitler on that day but this isn't a movie that should be viewed by a cynical audience and I guess a character being killed in literally the last hours of the war adds to the poignancy . In fact you'd have to have survived the second world war to fully appreciate the intellect beauty and soul of Powell and Pressburger's masterpiece . The scenes of heaven are painfully twee when viewed today ? Again you have to view the movie of the context when it was made . RAF bomber command lost 58 000 men during the war the same number that America lost in 'Nam but during a shorter period and a far far smaller pool of active combatants there's no atheists in a fox hole and I doubt if you'd lost a relative during the conflict you'd view material atheism as being a sensible thing . When Richar Attenborough's young pilot looks down in awe at the sight below him many war heroes must have openly wept at this scene as they remembered much missed comrades who didn't survive the war . Also bare in mind that despite losing several million people from 1939-45 there seems to be very few people from Germany passing through the pearly gates . it's obvious Nazis don't go to heaven The plot itself where dashing young pilot Peter Carter arguing for his life in front of a celestial court wouldn't have had much appeal to me if it wasn't for the subtext you see A MATTER OR LIFE AND DEATH is a highly political and visionary film that laments the end of the British empire as it's replaced by American ambitions . There's little things that show up the film as being made by people aware of American history and culture . One is the ethnic mix of America even today many Britons think that the USA is overwhelmingly composed of White Anglo Saxon Protestants when in fact only 51% of Americans are White European . The film rightly contains a scene where a multitude of different races confess I am an American as Peter is judged by Abraham Farlan an Anglophobe who was the first revolutionary killed by British forces in The American War Of Independence . As for the special relationship between Britain and America - What special relationship ? Powell and Pressburger know their history when it comes to Britain and America . They obviously know their future too So remember to watch this movie with some of your mind in the past and some of your mind in the present . It's strange beautiful poignant and clever but most of all it's a film that would never ever work if it were made in the last 40 years . Can you imagine if the story was set in 2003 and revolved around a British soldier killed in Iraq ? 
 I am a huge John Denver fan. I have a large collection of his music on vinyl. I saw this Christmas special when it was originally on TV and loved it. I have the original vinyl album and CD. I have the original CD and later release. The later release is missing several songs though. I see that it has been released this year with all original songs. To my surprise I found the original CD for sale at $75.00. WOW - to think that a Christmas Cd would be worth that much. To me no amount is worth selling this treasure. It is my favorite Christmas CD. I have never been able to find it on VHS or DVD. I would love to have either version. If anyone has one available please let me know. Thanks 
 Ya. That is what I think. Sure it was still a great show with John in it but I personally think that it is way better without. I love having C.J. and Grandpa living at the house because they are so funny together. When John was still around I really didn't laugh as much as I do now. It is too bad that no more are being made. ( I don't think...) because I would love to see some new material. My favorite character must be Rory. poor Rory is almost always left out. It is always about Bridget or Carrie. WHAT ABOUT RORY!!!??? Honestly this is a great show and to any one who has never watched it you must go and watch it. I almost guarantee you will laugh. well even chuckle. 
 Maybe Presque Rien is not the best movie ever made... But it is better than many of you have said. I still haven't seen a homo-themed movie better than this one. You Americans are accustomed to watch very narrative movies with a clear beginning development and outcome. But European movies are less narrative but makes you think much and feel. Many of you didn't understand the sense of the movie.. The purpose of this one is not show us a simple summer loving movie with commercial characters who fall in love and live happy forever . Summer Holidays and beach are only a background and this movie is directed to every young boy who may feel identified with those boys. Maybe some of you didn't understand well this movie because of its 3 parts showed as flashbacks. These 3 moments are: - Summertime in Pornichet when they meet and love. - After a year and half living together in Nantes Mathieu doesn't go to a psychiatric himself. He tries to suicide taking something and Cedric brings him to hospital. Later he appears talking with a psychiatrist to find the reason about he done that. - The last part is when Mathieu come back to Pornichet in winter alone.. to think about how his life have changed how his life become to be and trying to find himself. It's possible that some people couldn't understand all this well because all the scenes are mixed among them. But anyway as I said before... this is not a funny movie. If what someone want to see is meat for that we have Belami movies. Presque Rien what want to show us is how cruel can be the life for a young boy who is not sure about his feelings and not sure about what to do in life. Mathieu only wants to go away from home and try to live the kind of life that he thought could bring him the happiness.. But what seemed perfect at the beginning.. later is not as good as he thought and he become troubled and feel that he has lost the way of his life. He is lost and doesn't know what he really wants to do or what makes him happy. He finally become depressed and tries to commit suicide. So funny? Is not a funny movie. Very hot scenes? only a few.. but this is not a movie for entertainment. Is all about feelings... friendship love happiness unhappiness pain depression loneliness... I as many others feel identified with life and problems of Mathieu and that is what director wanted to do.. a movie who show us the cruel reality of a boy's life. For me the best homo-themed movie ever. 
 Stuck in a hotel in Kuwait I happily switched to the channel showing this at the very beginning. First Pachelbel's Canon brought a lump to my throat then the sight of a Tiger Moth (which my grandfather my father and I have all flown) produced a slight dampness around the eyes and then Crowe's name hooked me completely. I was entranced by this film Crowe's performance (again) the subject matter (and yes what a debt we owe) how various matters were addressed and dealt with the flying sequences (my father flew Avro Ansons too) the story - and as another contributor pointed out Crowe's recitation of High Flight. I won't spoil the film for anyone but separated from my wife by 4 000-odd miles as an ex-army officer who was deployed in a couple of wars and as private pilot I admit to crying heartily a couple of times. Buy it rent it download it beg borrow or steal it - but watch it. PS Did I spy a Bristol Blenheim (in yellow training colours)on the ground? Looked like a twin-engine aircraft with a twin-.303 Brownings in a dorsal turret. 
 I just got back from a screening a couple of hours ago and I was very happy with the movie when I left it. It's very intense and the closest I've come to crying in a movie in quite some time. That is a credit to Adam Sandler who delivers a magnificent performance on many levels and who probably deserves an Oscar nom for it were it not coming out so early in the year. Don Cheadle gives his usual superb performance playing the straight man to Adam's disturbed. There is some humor but most of it is really only funny in comparison to the tearjerking moments as Adam deals with his loss and Don struggles to help him. Adam plays two levels very well... when he is mentally stable he is funny and likable but when he is well less stable he's powerful and dark. I recommend it for anyone who likes intense mental dramas about difficult friendship and loss. 
 A delightful piece of cinema storytelling in a simple but effective way. Cinema after all is a visual media and Igor used its full potential. A young restless man boards a train with no destination in mind. In one of the compartments he meets with a girl. Words are not exchanged but their laundry washing are and from there we are taken on a ride with other peculiar characters and situations. The two leads are perfectly cast as their unique features tell you a story that needs no words. 
 'Holes' was a GREAT movie. Disney made the right choice. Every person who I have talked to about it said they LOVED it. Everyone casted was fit for the part they had and Shia Labeouf really has a future with acting. Sigourney Weaver was perfect for The Warden she was exactly how I imagined her. everyone who hasn't seen it I recommend it and I guarantee you will 'Dig It'. 
 I'm a bit conflicted over this. The show is on one hand awful the acting is terrible (even when we get actual name actors like Brad Pitt and Bill Moseley in one episode) the dialogue is moronic and the premise/moral of each episode feels like something lifted out of a 50s educational short. There's no way you'll be scared for a moment from any of these episodes and Robert Englund's cameos are short pointless and corny in a sort of a Bob Saget on America's Funniest Home Videos kind of way. On the other hand this is one of the funniest things to ever be on television. The 80s fashions the soft focus makes the actors look like their on the set of The View at all times the premises lend the material more to self-parody than scares so we're left with an episode where a high school kid is afraid if he fails his SAT's his girlfriend will dump him and his parents disown him another is afraid she'll be locked up in prison because she's a substandard mom (her husband is played by Brad Pit) another is afraid that all the parents in the world are in league against him when he runs away from home another is afraid she'll be confused with her socially-retarded twin another is afraid if he doesn't break up his mom and step-dad he'll get killed for having a party at his house. The list goes on and on. Being that these are dreams I suppose you could look past the ludicrous plot points and devices but they're so out of left field that there's no opportunities for the writers to actually scare the audience. You have characters dressed like something out of a 80s-themed nightmare wandering around delivering bad dialogue in very hammy fashion and making illogical decisions that serve no other purpose but to move the story to the next weird plot point (typically watching as a peripheral character does something uncharacteristic of a sane person while our main character stares aghast and too shocked to do anything about it). If you're looking for something that'll scare you stay away. If you're looking on the other hand for one of the funniest things to come out of the 80s ever. Watch it. Its been showing on Chiller TV lately (pretty much every day) and I've been watching earlier out of morbid curiosity and now just so I can get a good laugh in each day. With Arrested Development and Extras off the air this is officially the funniest thing on television right now. 
 Very funny well-crafted well-acted meticulous attention to detail. A real window into a specific time and place in history. Could almost believe this was a true story in a parallel universe. Interesting how Passport to Pimlico anticipates the Berlin airlift. A definite 10. 
 The Notorious Bettie Page is about a woman who always wanted to be an actress but instead became one of the most famous pin up girls in the history of America. Bettie Page played by Gretchen Mol was one of the first sex icons in America. The type of modeling Bettie Page took part in included nudity and bondage which lead to a U.S Senate investigation in the 1950s. Walking out of the film all I could think about was how far we have come in terms of pornography since the 1950s. You can go on the internet now and find some of most disturbing and shocking images ever shot that the footage questioned in The Notorious Bettie Page seems almost childlike and innocent. Most of the footage including the bondage did not feature nudity when Bettie Page was involved yet today we have sick images where we can see women having sex with animals. I find that maybe the envelope has been pushed a little too far since the 1950s because looking at this movie in terms of today's pornography it was very tastefully done. To be honest I was pretty impressed with The Notorious Bettie Page I found the film to be very well done and interesting. The movie is exactly what the trailer leads you to believe it will be and is a very interesting look at one of the first female sex icons in America. Gretchen Mol looks just like Bettie Page and gives a very fine performance. I also thought that since the movie was shot in black and white it made the film seem realistic because it made the audience believe they were watching a film created in the late 1950s. My only complaint about the film was the running time there seemed to be a few scenes that were cut and seemed to be a little shorter than they should have been. I looked this up and it seems that 10 minutes was cut from the film since its original showing at the Toronto Film Festival. Also the ending was pretty tame and I was expecting a little more from it or maybe some paragraphs to come on the screen to tell the audience more about Bettie Page's life where the film left off. Those are my only two complaints about the film other than that the directing was solid the acting was great especially Gretchen and the writing was good. Mary Harron who directed American Psycho which is one of my favorite films is the director and writer of The Notorious Bettie Page. I feel that Mary is a very talented director who knows how to create a setting and create great movies based on characters because like Psycho Bettie Page is a character study and a fine one at that. Harron captures the 40s and 50s with ease as well as all the characters. She is a very talented director who I hope will be around for many years to come. Bottom Line: The Notorious Bettie Page is definitely worth a look. It's a very interesting story that shows how far America as well as the world has come in terms of pornography. The film also provides a fine performance by Gretchen Mol who literally nails the role of Bettie Page on the head. And top it off with a talented director who was able to capture the look and feel of a previous era and you have a good movie on your hands. Sadly this film is probably going to flop since not many besides people who grew up in this era will show interest in the film but I think it's worth checking out. MovieManMenzel's final rating for The Notorious Bettie Page is a 8/10. It's an interesting character study about one of the most famous pin up girls and sex icons in American history. 
 Everyone plays their part pretty well in this little nice movie . Belushi gets the chance to live part of his life differently but ends up realizing that what he had was going to be just as good or maybe even better. The movie shows us that we ought to take advantage of the opportunities we have not the ones we do not or cannot have. If U can get this movie on video for around $10 it¡äd be an investment! 
 When you see the cover of the DVD you're convinced this is some Class B cheesy cheapie a film made for $1 000 in somebody's backyard. Wrong! This is quality material and really good. It's a comedy and a clever one at that. It also is very touching in spots with a nice spot of kindness. The production values are very good (this looks excellent) the actors are known the film's direction and sets are great. It's amazing. Who would have thought? Carrie-Ann Moss playing against-type is terrific as Helen Robinson the June Cleaver-like wife; Billy Connolly is great as the grunting good-hearted zombie Fido; Tim Blake Nelson ( Mr. Theopolis ) is a hoot is the neighbor with the sexy zombie girlfriend Tammy and Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as dads (check) are excellent too K'Sun Ray as young Timmy Robinson shouldn't be overlooked either. In fact he probably has more lines in the movie than anyone. If I explain the story it will sound so stupid that few of you would watch it. You'll just have to take the word of the people here who liked it and found it to be a very very pleasant surprise. You need a dark sense of humor though; an appreciation of the absurd. 
 I highly recommend this film. Set in the Bladerunner-esquire future of 2054 Paris it is in most respect a classic film noir script: lady in peril sister trying to find her honest cop fighting everyone. Luckily it avoids being stereotypical and combines a pretty good storyline with interesting innovative visuals. The film might remind you of Sin City in look but it has an even sharper even more graphic novel look that I found really compelling. Each frame each sequence seems like it could have been pulled from the desk of a skilled graphic designer. In terms of story and artwork you can find nods going back to the nineteen forties (or even earlier with the classic views of the Eiffel Tower and Sacre Couer) and movies like Casablanca as well as looking toward a grim future where our destines are ruled by corporations. Make any excuse you need to see this film. 
 A bit quirky and bordering bad taste; but intelligent enough to be worthy of watching. A wheelchair-bound young woman Jane Hatchard(Helena Bonham Carter)is teamed with a reluctant caregiver Richard(Kenneth Branagh). Richard is an artist that daydreams of human flight. He builds an airplane in his garage and intends to fly it. He wants to resurrect his own troubled life by taking care of the independent dying Jane who suffers from an neurological disease that has all but left her speechless and very little motor skills. Wheelchair-bound and full of spirit her last dying wish is to loose her virginity. She offers herself to Richard who won't help her directly; but is willing to rob a bank in order to pay a gigolo to do the deed. I found this flick ambitious and humorous. Even in this role Carter has a certain charisma and likability. 
 This is a fantastic series first and foremost. It is very well done and very interesting. As a huge WWII buff I had learned a lot before seeing this series. One of the best things this has going for it is all the interviews with past individuals back when the war was relatively fresh in their minds comparatively speaking that is. It is nothing against the men that you see getting interviewed in the programs of today it is just that most of these men weren't really involved in the upper echelons of what was happening then. One of the best parts is the narrating by Sir Laurence Oliver. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to learn about WWII but really think only the die-hards (such as myself) will want to buy this or watch it more than once. My only real complaint about this entire series is that some of the facts aren't quite as accurate as we now know. Especially with the information about Soviet Union is exaggerated or just plain inaccurate in places. That information is now different we now know because of the fall of the USSR. Overall a fascinating look at WWII and a must see for any serious WWII historian professional or personal alike. 
 This was my second time watching the film (via the French-language version as opposed to the first which was dubbed in Italian) and I feel that it improves on subsequent viewings. A compelling if slowly built-up character study that's beautifully shot and with the Parisian settings being equally impressive. In the long run it's not top-grade Polanski and I would rank it at number 9 in his filmography but it's still a confident mix of subtle chills and surprisingly often broad comedy. It also features a fine cast all of whom are in good form but especially Isabelle Adjani Melvyn Douglas and Jo Van Fleet. Even so I'm a bit baffled by the sudden compulsion for Trelkovsky to 'change' into the previous tenant; apart from the owner of the caf¨¦ opposite the apartment building where he is given whatever Simone used to have without asking him if he wished any different there is little to indicate (as far as I could discern anyway) that this is what everybody wanted of him! Okay so he found Simone's belongings still lying in the apartment but what exactly drove him to wear her dresses and make himself up as her (even if he apparently started doing this unconsciously)? Following his nightmarish visions in the bathroom the last section of the film (where Adjani all but disappears) is almost anti-climactic - especially the scene where the landlord and the other tenants witness his attempted suicide as if it were a night at the Opera a concept which had already been used 46 years earlier by Jean Cocteau in THE BLOOD OF A POET (1930)! The ending then is at once predictable and unresolved: just what made the two occupants of this particular apartment jump out of the window?!; I remember this factor bugging me on first viewing as well and I'm sorry to say it's no clearer now! Mind you the film's first two-thirds are pretty solid but I wish that Polanski had been less reliant on obscure plot points throughout. 
 As B movies go it was well above average (I warn the reader now that I may reveal certain key elements of the plot or other parts of the movie although I am trying to minimise any such tendency). As sequels usually go it was utterly fantastic(despite a cookie cutter approach to trying to copy certain elements from the original movie verbatum. Despite this sometimes tedious tendency it seemed to work in this particular film so long as the viewer could divorce his attention from comparisons to the original Scanners ). The movie was similar in ways to the Superman series in terms of the main character's description of his early childhood and relationship with his parents (who seemed modelled along the same lines as the Kents in the Superman stories) and the theme of a morally pure hero possessed of extraordinary powers from an early age etc. The depiction of profound feelings of alienation of prodigious or otherwise non-conforming children adolescents and/or adults was a theme which reminded me of films such as Real Genius and (to a more superficial degree) Doctor Mordrid and struck a particularly strong chord. The film had a positive message and was fun to watch. I found some of the insights and accuracy (in terms of depiction of certain aspects of paranormal experiences) fascinating and even profoundly touching at times. These moments occasionally appeared from among all of the great formula-driven schlock and gratuitous sex(uality in this case as the sexual elements were tastefully done) and violence that makes B movies (or Shakespearian plays for that matter!) so much fun to watch! This is a must watch for all comic book Sci-fi remote viewing enthusiasts and horror fans! With the right exposure in the right circles the film could develop quite a cult following along with the original Scanners . 
 My baby sitter was a fan so I saw many of the older episodes while growing up. I'm not a fan of Scooby Doo so I'm not sure why I left the TV on when this show premiered. To my surprise I found it enjoyable. To me Shaggy and Scooby were the only interesting characters *dodges tomatoes from fans of the others* so I like that they only focus on those two. However this may cause fans of the original shows to hate it. I like the voice acting especially Dr. Phinius Phibes. I liked listening to him even before I knew he was Jeff Bennett. And Jim Meskimen as Robi sounds to me like he's really enjoying his job as an actor. I also get a kick out of the techies with their slightly autistic personalities and their desires to play Dungeons and Dragons or act out scenes from Star Wars (not called by those names in the show of course). 
 I understand this film to be a debut feature and as such it is very impressive. It has the feel and pacing of a true indie yet director Todd Yellin clearly possesses the photographic and editorial vision command and judgment of a mature and seasoned professional. The shots are well framed and thought out and serve to move the story forward. He and screenwriter Ivan Solomon deliver a story that has much more depth and lyricism than typical paint by numbers type scripts. It's a story that needs Judd Hirsch caliber character talent to have a shot at working. Judd is fantastic as usual; as are Scott Cohen and the beautiful Susan Floyd. The real surprise though is Elliot Korte who plays Adam Groden. Yellin was able to coax nuance out of the young actor in a role that could have been easily devalued by stereotype or overreach. Anyway I found the film refreshing and entertaining. 
 But how can you stand to mange a baseball team that can't win. For George Knox it is not easy. As the movie opens Roger Beaumont (Joseph-Gordon-Levitt) and his best friend J.P (Milton Davis Jr.) are riding on thier bikes around the angels' stadium. When they return to thier foster mother's home Roger is suprised to have a visit from his dad (Dermot Mulroney). His mom is dead! And when he asks his father when they going to be a family again he father jokes I say when the angels win the division championship So later on Roger and J.P hide in a tree to watch the angels play baseball. When the manger George Knox (Danny Glover) take out his pitcher the pitcher gets mad and gets into a fight with him and soon the angels team get into the fightm that gets Knox ejected from the game. That night Roger makes a prayer for the angles win the championship. When his foster mother Maggie Nelson (Brenda Ficker) agrees that Roger and J.P go to a basball Roger sees real angles come on the field and helps the left fielder (Matthew McConaughey) makes a catch that leaves the manger and the play-by-play man (Jay. O Sanders) how did he to that. Roger learns from the head angel (Christopher Lloyd) that only he can see the angles because he was the only that prayed for help. 10/10 
 As a kid I thought this movie was great. It had animals it had beautiful music and it had my favorite actor: Michael J. Fox. Now I still love this movie for different reasons. It has well trained animals that are put through various stunts and scenes that look excellent on camera. It has beautiful well-written musical that fits the scenes perfectly with rousing fast-paced melodies and the heart wrenching main theme that still makes me cry. Even when people hum it. And it has my favorite actor Michael J. Fox. Based on a book this is the story of three house pets an intelligent overly-trusting and considerably paternal lab by the name of Shadow a witty and vain - but still smart - cat with a fear of water named Sassy and a street-smart ridiculously curious and slightly neurotic bulldog Chance. The three are taken to a friend's farm when their family goes away. Dismayed and worried the pets break out and plan a trip across the Sierra mountains for the trip of their lives. A truly incredible journey. So what maybe home IS just over that mountain. But what if it isn't? I suggest Homeward Bound for people that like the three amazing actors providing the voices for the lead animal characters and for anyone else that ... yeah everyone go watch it. 
 This movie was highly entertaining. The soundtrack (Bian Adams) is simply beautiful and inspiring. Even more impressive is Brian Adams doing all the songs in French as well. The score is also uplifting and dramatic. The movie is made from a mix of traditional animation combined with computer generated images. The result is truly stunning. I watch this film at least once a week with my kids and we never tire of it. The story is compelling and well narrated. I don't understand anyone who would rank this movie less than a 7. Definately a keeper in my household. 
 Gorgeous Barbara Bach plays Jennifer Fast a television reporter who travels with her crew (Karen Lamm and Lois Young) to Solvang California to cover a Danish festival. The problem is that their accommodations have fallen through and all hotels in town are full. So they travel out of town to a remote location and take advantage of the hospitality of the seemingly friendly Ernest Keller (a phenomenal Sydney Lassick). Wouldn't you know it Ernest and meek partner Virginia (Lelia Goldoni) are hiding a big secret in their cellar: pitiable deformed diaper-clad Junior (Stephen Furst in a remarkable performance) who ultimately terrorizes the girls. A deliciously unhinged Lassick plays the true monster in this disturbing little horror movie. It builds slowly but surely to an intense confrontation / climax delivering the horror in small doses until the final half hour. The hotel and the foreboding cellar - large echoes of Psycho here - are great settings. Most of all the perverse plot involves incest and patricide allowing the movie to take on a truly dark quality. And yet it also becomes poignant as we realize Junior is no one-dimensionally evil bogeyman but as much a victim as the girls. The final shot is especially sad. The Unseen is a solid little horror flick worthy of discovery. 8/10 
 This is a really nice and sweet movie that the entire family can enjoy. It's about two dogs and a cat who are taken away to live with someone else for a little while but the animals don't understand and they escape and go to find the family on their own. The cat is named Sassy and she lives up to her name. Chance is the younger dog who knows a lot about life on the inside of the pound. Shadow is the older and wiser dog who senses things. Put those three together on an adventure and it makes for a happy and fun filled time. There are no special effects of the mouths moving so it isn't cheesy at all. It's the best talking animal movie that I've seen so far. It's a really good movie for families. 
 A fine western following the fate of those who possess the prize winning gun a Winchester '73. It has a great cast who give superb cliche characterisations with help from the usual effective story telling direction from Mann. 
 Lily Mars a smalltown girl living in Indiana dreams of making it big on Broadway and her aspirations are given a lift when successful Broadway producer John Thornway returns to his hometown for a visit. Lily tries everything she can to get Thornway to notice her but he just gets annoyed with her antics. When Thornway goes back to New York to stage his show Lily follows (unknown to John of course) and Thornway eventually gives her a small role in his next show only as a favor to her family however Thornway starts to fall for this young girl and a romance blossoms which makes the show's leading lady Isabel Rekay jealous. When Isabel gets fed up with the John-Lily romance causing friction with the show she leaves and John decides to make Lily the star. Isabel returns later and Thornway is forced to tell Lily that she is back to her small bit role in the play which also may jeopardize the romance. Very charming film and a refreshing change to see Garland put the comedic touches into her role (her reading of Lady MacBeth while supposed to be humorous never threatened her singing career) I enjoyed Heflin's character (Thornway) more when he was annoyed with Lily rather than be the romantic. The film got to be somewhat predictable and the scenes weren't assembled that well together but a very enjoyable film. Rating 7. 
 The Mother tells of a recently widowed mid-60's mother of two adult children (Reid) who on the heels of her husband's death finds herself awakening from a life of sleepwalking as she has an affair with a young carpenter who is also her daughter's married lover. The film dwells on the quietly passive Mom her tenuous relationship with her grown son and daughter the silent needs she attempts to soothe in bed with her young lover and the convolutions arising therefrom. A somewhat antiseptic drama with rumbling psychodramatic undercurrents The Mother does an excellent job of dealing with uncomfortable issues realistically while avoiding gratuitous sensationalism. Will play best with more mature audiences possibly women who may better empathize with the central character her needs and issues. (B+) 
 Does anyone know the exact quote about time and love by George Ede aka Father Fitzpatrick in the move It had to be you? He was talking to Charlie and Annna in the church as they were leaving? If not I will have to rent the movie. This was a great movie. I also loved Serendipity! Great love story for the soul! I met my one true love (my Soulmate) and although I had the experience to meet him when I had least expecting it I wasn't ready for that kind of emotional relationship. Altho we did marry I wasn't mature enough to give as much as I thought I would. I got complacent and took his love for granted and he withstood it for 7 years. He finally left with resentment but we are still hurt and angry & in disbelief about the way it turned out. I had some very hard lessons to learn and we have now been apart 3 years. This movie meant a lot because I am still waiting on reconciling with my one and only true love. I can NOW appreciate that distinct feeling inside of me and the quote of Father Fitzpatrick rang true for me. I know when he has healed enough to trust me again we will remarry. Don't EVER GET COMPLACENT AND TAKE TRUE LOVE FOR GRANTED! IT HAS BEEN THE HARDEST LESSON OF MY LIFE. Also the music in this movie is OUTSTANDING and MEANINGFUL! This movie is DEEP and spiritually uplifting. TRUE LOVE is worth waiting for if it is meant to be it will no matter what IT WILL HAPPEN! Nothing is impossible even when it's the second time around! Thanks! 
 James Dickey is a wonderfully descriptive author. When one reads Deliverance one is instantly transported into the lush backwoods of the Deep South. When one watches John Boorman's film version of the book one realizes just how accurately he captures the essence of the book. The camera is as descriptive as the narration. The characters are fully realized and the portrayals are fantastic. I first saw this movie in 1992 after my freshman year of college. I was in a phase where I was watching movies that were all released within a couple of years of my birth in 1973. Among them were Patton Papillon and All the President's Men ; fine films all of them. This one was easily the class of the group. That says a lot. 
 Brilliant adaptation of the novel that made famous the relatives of Chilean President Salvador Allende killed. In the environment of a large estate that arises from the ruins becoming a force to abuse and exploitation of outrage a luxury estate for the benefit of the upstart Esteban Trueba and his undeserved family the brilliant Danish director Bille August recreates in micro which at the time would be the process leading to the greatest infamy of his story to the hardened Chilean nation and whose main character would Augusto Pinochet (Stephen similarities with it are inevitable: recall as an example that image of the senator with dark glasses that makes him the wink to the general to begin making the palace). Bille August attends an exceptional cast in the Jeremy protruding Irons whose character changes from arrogance and extreme cruelty the hard lesson that life always brings us to almost force us to change. In Esteban fully applies the law of resonance with great wisdom Solomon describes in these words: The things that freckles are the same punishment that will serve you. Unforgettable Glenn Close playing splint the tainted sister of Stephen whose sin driven by loneliness spiritual and platonic love was the wife of his cruel snowy brother. Meryl Streep also brilliant a woman whose name came to him like a glove Clara. With telekinetic powers cognitive and mediumistic this hardened woman loyal to his blunt conservative husband is an indicator of character and self-control that we wish for ourselves and for all human beings. Every character is a portrait of virtuosity (as Blanca worthy rebel leader Pedro Segundo unhappy ...) or a portrait of humiliation like Stephen Jr. the bastard child of Senator who serves as an instrument for the return of the boomerang. The film moves the bowels we recreated some facts that should not ever be repeated but that absurdly still happen (Colombia is a sad example) and another reminder that against all life is wonderful because there are always people like Isabel Allende and immortalize just Bille August. 
 Still the definitive program about the Second World War The World At War isn't just long but also very informative. The series contains 26 episodes (each episode lasts for about 45 min.) and includes the events leading up to and following in the wake of the war. Most episodes are about the war in Europe and there are several episodes about the war in the Pacific. Other episodes include information about the wars in Africa Burma the Atlantic and the home fronts of Germany Great Britain United States and Soviet Union. There is one episode that's dedicated to the Holocaust. The series starts off with the episode A New Germany (1933-1939) and tells about the rise of the Nazis in Germany and German territorial gains prior to the outbreak of war. The series ends with the episode Remember; the war's influence in a post-war world. Remember is a fitting episode to end this great program. Every episode begins with a short introduction and then with opening credits. The credits are accompanied by a powerful music theme. There are many fitting music pieces throughout the series. Each episode is like a mini-film. The footage is fantastic and so is the way it was put together. In addition some of the footage is in color. The information included also makes the episodes memorable and entertaining. The series was produced by Jeremy Isaacs for Thames Television (UK). Commissioned in 1969 it took four years to produce such was the depth of its research. The series was narrated by Laurence Olivier (one of the most famous and revered actors of the 20th century). The series interviewed leading members of the Allied and Axis campaigns including eyewitness accounts by civilians enlisted men officers and politicians amongst them Albert Speer Karl Donitz Jimmy Stewart Bill Mauldin Curtis LeMay Lord Mountbatten Alger Hiss Toshikazu Kase Arthur Harris Charles Sweeney Paul Tibbets Traudl Junge and historian Stephen Ambrose. Jeremy Isaacs says in The Making of The World at War that he sought to interview not necessarily the surviving big names but their aides and assistants. The most difficult subject to locate and persuade to be interviewed according to Isaacs was Heinrich Himmler's adjutant Karl Wolff. The latter admitted to witnessing a large-scale execution in Himmler's presence. The World At War is often considered to be the definitive television history of the Second World War. Some consider it the finest example of the documentary form. In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000 voted for by industry professionals The World at War ranked 19th. The program has everything that the viewer needs to know about the war. After watching a few episodes I liked the series so much that I tried to watch the remaining episodes one after the other. I've seen some of them several times. There are two other great documentary series that I know of that may be of interest to the viewer. One is called The Great War (1964) that's about World War I. The other is called Cold War (1998) that's about the Cold War obviously. 
 I'm going to review the 2 films as a whole because I feel that is how it should be considered and watched. When I talk about 'the film' I am talking about parts 1 & 2 together when watched one after the other as they should be. Thank you Jon Anderson Steven Soderbergh & Benicio Del Toro. This film is a refreshing bold gritty and true film. And it hearkens a new style of film making. No Faux drama. No Swelling sound track. Not Faux Documentary style. Just clean shots and an attempt to stick to the facts. I have been reading Jon Anderson's Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life and recently finished Fidel's Auto biography and this had helped my ability to soak this film in properly. But I have to say that it is Jon Anderson's exhaustive penultimate and wonderful biography that has given this film the proper historical back bone. Anderson was consultant on this film (or these 2 films). What makes this film a true thing is that it is clean. No swelling music or slow-motion photography to heighten drama and even more importantly; no fake documentary shaky camera. Just square shots and straight forward shooting style. The type of camera used makes you feel right there in the jungle. Benicio Del Toro should be given full honors for this I never doubted him as Che throughout the film... not once. He did a wonderful job and I will respect him for ever for this. Some people complain that the film only deals with 2 slices of his life and not the whole. But I think this is one of the true beautiful aspects of this film: it doesn't try to be everything. It doesn't try to 'tell the story'. A person's life is too multifaceted to try and tell in 2 4 8 16 or 32 hours. This is one of the subtle beauties of this film it resists that temptation and stays focused on the intent of letting us GET A FEEL FOR CHE HIS DEVELOPING MILITARISTIC MIND AND THE FORCES AROUND HIM. It focuses on 3 slices of time: The Battle to over throw Batista Che's U.N. speech and the Gorilla preparations in Bolivia. Motorcycle Diaries already told his young man side and I applaud S. Soderbergh for focusing on other aspects instead. I keep referring to Jon Anderson's book and the film stays true. The only weak link for me are the casting (not the performance) of Matt Damon. In a film so loaded with true to life performances an American (Matt Damon) playing a Bolivian is a clunky stretch - he does well but after so much care in the casting this was an over-site. Small and completely forgiven. The reality that the rest of the casting gives you and most notably Benicio Del Toro's amazing job put's this film at the top of my list. The fact that this film went almost straight to video say's something about how the cold war ethics that would never allow the 'revolutionized Cuba' to become what it might have are still at work keeping it's story quiet. If not out of clandestine muffling then out of the effects of properly done propaganda that has prejudiced this topic. This is a must see film and Jon Anderson's Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life is a must read if you want to start to get a grasp of the early effects on the global mind set regarding the expansion of international / political financial chess moves of the 40's 50's & 60's that placed unfair pressure on our South American neighbors and the effects it fostered. 
 This sweeping drama has it all: top notch acting incredible photography good story. It is often compared to Braveheart because both movies take place in historical Scotland. Even though I love Braveheart I think this is the better of the two films. Jessica Lange gave an incredible performance (should have been nominated for an Oscar). Liam Neeson is fantastic in the title role. Tim Roth plays one of the most evil despicable characters in film history (he was nominated for an Oscar). John Hurt is excellent as Lord Montrose another dislikeable character. I am always amazed at the incredible range of characters that John Hurt can play. This is a story of a dispute over money between Rob Roy and his clan and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a self made man who will not solve his problems with Montrose if it violates his sense of honor. Montrose who inherited his title has no sense of honor. And that is basically what this story is all about; honor of the common man versus corruption of the nobility. This movie is very entertaining it should appeal to all. It has romance action beautiful scenery and has a exciting plot. One of my favorite films. 
 When this movie first came out back in 1984 Prince was one of the hottest acts around. Everyone wanted to see this movie which was not much more than a extended music video. The acting was pretty bad but what can you expect from musicians acting on the big screen for the first time? Despite that it was still a very entertaining film! Morris Day and Jerome Benton provide some all time classic comedy especially their rendition of The Password which will make you think of Abbott & Costello doing their who's on first baseball routine. Appolina (who went by a single name then) provided some beautiful breasts so you had the brief nudity covered. Plus she is very attractive. And of course the soundtrack of the album is one of the best Prince ever recorded. Prince later on had a fallout with Warner Bros. and changed his name but at this particular time in his career he was at the top of his game. This movie doesn't rank in the all time great category but it is pretty entertaining. 
 I hate those stories that begin with a funeral but I'm afraid this one begins the day we buried George. Not that we buried him. In the interests of the environment we had him incinerated. So speaks Elizabeth (Judi Dench) George's widow. She's led a comfortable predictable life with George. She has two grown children and a 12-year-old grandchild. But when she was 15 and in school in the midst of World War II she played the sax at night in an all-girl (almost all-girl) band called The Blonde Bombshells. The 'almost was because the drummer was Patrick a charming rogue who had no desire to fight and possibly be killed. With a yellow wig a long red dress and makeup Patrick looked almost as good as the others. One afternoon after the funeral Elizabeth finds herself in the attic of her home playing the sax she had put away. She used to practice but only when George was out of the house on the golf course. Then two things happen. Her granddaughter amazed at how good Elizabeth is starts talking about how the Blonde Bombshells could be reunited and play at her school dance. Then Elizabeth encounters Patrick (Ian Holm) now just as much an aging oldster as Elizabeth and just as much attracted to her as he was more than 50 years ago. (He also was attracted to all the other members of the Bombshells. The roses that would appear on his bass drum had a special meaning that attested to his affection.) Well why not see if the other band members can be located and why not give it a shot for a reunion performance at her granddaughter's school? Why not? One member of the band is gaga. One is dead. One is in jail. One has found salvation with the Salvation Army. One they can find no trace of. One is last known to be in the States. One is a professional singer and has no intention of doing a school gig even for a reunion. But one by one Elizabeth and Patrick bring together the surviving members of the Bombshells. We don't know if enough of them can be found. The rehearsals more often than not turn into off-key shambles. While they do this we share Elizabeth's flashbacks of what life was like when she and Patrick were young in war-time London playing in the band while the bombs were falling. As terrible as it was it was the most exciting time of their lives. When the night of Elizabeth's granddaughter's dance arrives of course the Blonde Bombshells filled with jitters and renewed friendship blow the youngsters away. Afterwards Elizabeth informs us that the Bombshells are continuing to play at gigs and that she and Patrick have no plans to get married...but see nothing wrong with a little fooling around. This is sentimental hogwash expertly done and not bad at all. What makes it work are the skill and charm of Judi Dench and Ian Holm. When I hear the term warm-hearted comedy I usually cringe unless the actors are first-rate. Dench and Holm are wonders to watch as they take something as light-weight and predictable as this script and turn it into something that charms us. Then there's the old broad gambit that's fun if you remember the old broads. Among the Blonde Bombshells are Leslie Caron Joan Sims Olympia Dukakis Billie Whitelaw and Cleo Laine. Laine sings three numbers and almost over-balances the production. She is so strong and unique a jazz talent that while she's singing the program nearly becomes the Cleo Laine Show. Another attractive feature is the number of great WWII songs played in strong swing. 
 My cable TV has what's called the Arts channel which is a catch-as-catch-can situation sometimes sometimes films sometimes short clips of films or ballets and I came into this just as the bar scene came on where they tear up their coupons. Excellent exquisite Ealing wins again my wartime-Glasgow-raised mother would love this should I ever find a copy of it. Some of Britain's best artists from Mr Holloway to Wayne and Radford and the delicious Miss Rutherford having a wonderful time gently sticking it to the Home Office. Loved the last scene where as soon as they are back in England! the temperature plummets and it rains... 
 During a Kurt Weill celebration in Brooklyn WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE? was finally unearthed for a screening. It is amazing that a motion picture from any era that has Weill-Gershwin collaborations can possibly be missing from the screens. The score stands tall and a CD of the material with Gershwin and Weill only underscores its merits which are considerable. Yes the film has its problems but the score is not one of them. Ratoff is not in his element as the director of this musical fantasy and Fred MacMurray cannot quite grasp the material. Then too the 'modern' segment is weakly written. BUT the fantasy elements carry the film to a high mark as does the work of the two delightful leading ladies - Joan Leslie and June Haver. Both have the charm that this kind of work desperately needs to work. As a World War II salute to our country's history - albeit in a 'never was' framework the film has its place in Hollywood musical history and should be available for all to see and to find its considerable merits. 
 Superb film with no actual spoken dialogue which enhances the level of suspense. The whole approach gives a completely different twist to a war film. Well worth watching again if only it could be found. I saw it perhaps 20 or so years ago. - Fantastic! 
 In the immediate aftermath following World War II sound minds in Hollywood tried to distance themselves from the mindless flag-waving that is a natural ingredient in a war effort. Best Years of Our Lives' and even 'Gentleman's Agreement' investigated the way Americans looked at themselves in the wake of the war but Delmer Daves' Pride of the Marines beat them to it. The film is about Philadelphia smart alec John Garfield who goes to war as a marine and after a nightmarish evening in a foxhole with Japanese soldiers eerily crying out at him and his buddies Mariiines tonight you die! he is blinded by a hand-grenade and dumps his girlfriend back home rather than have to depend on her after coming home. Delmer Daves is uncompromising in his depiction on these men who are brave as it were almost by coincidence. They are there in the foxhole and when shot at they react. So much for heroism but they get the job done. And then comes the self-pity the dark gloomy sense of humor. Garfield is in angry denial of his blindness and the film makes no excuses There's no free candy for anyone in this world as his buddy tells him. The same guy a Jew played by Dane Clark reminds him In a war somebody gets it and you're it. Everybody's got problems! When I get back some guys won't hire me because my name is Diamond . Great movies are made with guts like these and if the first half hour of 'Pride of the Marines' fails to rise to the occasion completely from then on it evolves into a true work of art. You weep and you ponder you ache and you hope against hope. Well simply: art. 
 A few years ago I added a comment to the IMDB on The Real McCoys TV series. I said then and repeat now it was a charming funny and entertaining show well-acted with wonderful characterizations. I recently saw on DVD four old episodes PLUS the Reunion of 2000 with Richard Crenna Kathy Nolan and Tony Martinez. As another writer here mentioned it is curious that Lydia Reed (Hassie) and Michael Winkelman (Little Luke) weren't refered to but perhaps they can be tracked down via SAG or AFTRA. The reunion show was well done and gave us many unknown insights into the show. One piece of inside information we did NOT get was whether or not Kathy Nolan regretted quitting the show in an unpleasant contract dispute which left Luke a widow in it's last year which wasn't very good. Nolan went on to do a bomb of a comedy called Broadside about women nurses in the Pacific in WW II. Get it? BROADside? No not funny. Unlike the sleazy salacious and violent TRASH on TV now that is so undermining our values The Real McCoys entertained with decent values and fine human beings. And I thank all involved including the creator Irving Pinkus for having brought it to my family. We never missed it. 
 What a fun movie! If you're a Giallo fan Red Queen Kills 7 Times is a real winner. To begin with it's hard to go wrong with Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfatti in the same Giallo. Both are wonderful - especially the wide-eyed innocent Bouchet as the guilt ridden woman fearing for her life. The kill scenes in Red Queen Kills 7 Times are especially nice and feature enough blood to make most fans happy. One of the first murders comes rather unexpectedly and really gets the movie off to a good start. The killer The Red Queen is one of the most over-the-top and interesting looking murderers I've seen in an Italian movie. The 70s sets and fashions are wonderful. In fact all the visuals are interesting with the laughing Red Queen running across the bridge at night being one of my favorite moments in the film. The convoluted plot held my interest throughout. Finally Bruno Nicolai's score may be the best I've heard from the composer. The main theme is so memorable I haven't been able to get it out of my head for two days. The only two issues I have with Red Queen Kills 7 Times come in the film's finale. First the person responsible for the murders is far too easy to spot. If you've seen more than a couple Gialli you won't have any problem determining who is behind the killings. Second the ending feels a little too rushed and as a result is a bit confusing. I'm definitely not one who needs every plot point spelled out to me but I'll admit to being at a loss to explain it all. A second viewing might just clear this up. 
 Magicians is a wonderful ride from start to finish thanks in large part to the magic that is generated by the stars. Alan Arkin is fantastic in one of his best roles in decades. Like any really fine film it's a journey in which the theme is redemption and the results of dreaming. I can't believe this film is SO difficult to find -- I'd buy it on DVD in a heartbeat but have yet to find an outlet. 
 I thought this would be a sequel to the original 36th Chamber of Shaolin but actually it's more of a light-hearted sister to the original. Gordon Liu still stars as a would-be hero on a quest to learn kung fu to defeat those pesky Manchus... but this time around it's lighter and more comedic. The film centres around the local dye mill where wages are cut due to the hiring of 10 new Manchurian bosses. Liu plays Chao who is able to fool the mill bosses into thinking he is a shaolin monk possessing almost magical kung fu skill. But his luck runs out he is exposed as a fraud and he promises the mill workers that he will go to the Shaolin monastery to learn kung fu and return to protect them. The comedy really begins at the monastery where Chao makes several bungling attempts to get accepted. This sets up lots of really funny moments and lots of great fight choreography. Continuing in the 36th Chamber tradition we see all kinds of neat and interesting (and supremely hokey) training methods at the monastery as well as creative uses of wooden benches as weapons. Also unique and of note is the blending of kung fu and the craft of bamboo scaffold building. Chao is not accepted as a student at Shaolin but is made to build bamboo scaffolding for the 10 year restoration of the monastery. On the DVD I bought there is a special on bamboo scaffold building and the inspiration that director Lau Kar-Leung drew from it. This is a craft many hundreds (perhaps thousands) of years old and in Hong Kong scaffolding is still built of bamboo even on large high-rises though the West exclusively uses steel tubes and clamps. As a result of his scaffolding work Chao develops a special style of kung fu... when asked what kind it is he hilariously replies scaffolding kung fu!! which he first tests during a dust-up with the monastery's Abbot. In the final confrontation with the Manchus there is a dazzling array of creative uses for bamboo poles and ties. From a comedy perspective I think it's one of the best of the kung fu genre. As a kung fu film in general it also stands out... I recommend it to anyone! 
 Shore Leave is mostly an average Star Trek adventure. Nothing wrong with the episode though. I simply think that this is not the best representation of what the show had to offer to fans. It is lightweight entertaining nothing more. However I'm glad to see that a TV show of this type had enough good sense to take a break from serious intergalactic conflicts. In this episode Kirk decides to grant his crew some time off and a landing party is beamed down to a planet that looks like the perfect place for a vacation. As usual the planet is not as peaceful as it appears to be. There are some action and tense moments but most of the story is played for laughs. Good but unexceptional. 
 I'll admit to being biased when I reviewed this since it was my introduction to the series. I saw this film for the first time in ~2005 on the late night Fear Friday on AMC which often pulls obscure gems like this out of cold storage for new generations. I made it a point to watch the entire Amicus anthology series before reviewing any of them here to make sure I had perspective. Looking back I still rate The House That Dripped Blood as my favorite followed closely by Tales From The Crypt and then Asylum. I think all of the elements that make this series charming---the vintage '60s/'70s style cinematography creepy to kooky far-fetched tales and the utter Britishness of it all right down the backing music----came together better here than any of the others overall. The movie centers around a very old English country house and the misfortune that befalls all that dwell within. The first story involves a horror writer and his wife who moved into this secluded place to get a break from the city so he could concentrate on his passion. He creates a murderous character called Dominic and soon starts experiencing great difficulty telling reality from fiction. There is a subtle physchedelia here via his torment that I found amusing yet creepy. Oh and those horrible prop teeth (then again these are British actors maybe those were REAL!!!) The second story is the tale of a lonely old man (Peter Cushing) that has moved here to escape his loneliness yet it only worsens as he is haunted by lost love. He seems to have found possible salvation at a local (very creepy) wax museum but it turns out he would have been much better off alone....... The third story includes the great Christopher Lee (my fav British horror actor) as a single father with a rather disturbed and thoroughly creepy young daughter. He is constantly wary of her getting into things she shouldn't---like witchcraft! She has a natural talent for it with good reason. Lee is superb here as the ice cold disciplinarian that man has a true talent for playing characters that are absolutely devoid of warmth!! But despite his best efforts the little troublemaker does in fact learn forbidden knowledge and bad things follow...... This final story is the tale of a cynical old veteran actor that feels the young director he's working with isn't qualified to capture a proper vampire film right down to the quality of the costumes and his cloak in particular. So he goes to a old curiosity store in the middle of a foggy night to get something more authentic . Little does he know that he picked up a truly authentic vampire's cloak! Putting it on at the stroke of midnight has rather noticeable effects. By the time I had gotten to this fourth and final story it was after 3 am and I couldn't quite stay awake on the first try (not from boredom). But I did experience something that I have hundreds of times a curious bonding experience I have with films or music when I drift in and out of sleep and the film/music becomes part of my dream!! Great fun!! This bizarre story was perfect for that and seemed much scarier the first time than it actually was because I woke up right when he was levitated by the cloak's power and couldn't quite comprehend was what happening at first. Not long after the lovely Ingrid Pitt a costar on his movie set came to visit and he warned her not to put on the cloak at midnight---but he needn't have bothered for she was a real vampire herself. The chintzy keyboard jingle that followed as she flew toward him on the staircase was simply hysterical!! And again in my half-asleep state seemed rather confusing! Side Note: Make sure to catch Lee and Pitt along with the stunning Amicus star Britt Ekland in the all time classic film The Wicker Man (1973). The weakest link here was the interlacing commentary between stories but based on the stories themselves this is a classic! Objectively I would say the third story is best but I like the 4th most because it makes me smile so much.Very highly recommended for horror fans and if you're a British horror fan it's mandatory! I'd say it's worthwhile to view the series in chronological order if you can. The last film of this series Monster Club (1980) is certainly the weakest. I think the first 3-4 films except for the at times mediocre Torture Garden (1967) are the best but if you like any of them you should watch them all at least once. You'll probably be back many more times to watch your favorites. 
 I like this presentation - I have read Bleak House and I know it is so difficult to present the entire book as it should be and even others like Little Dorrit - I have to admit they did a very good show with the staged Nicholas Nickelby. I love Diana Rigg and I could see the pain of Lady Dedlock even through the expected arrogance of the aristocracy. I am sorry I think she is the best Lady Dedlock... I am not sure who could have made a better Jarndyce but I am OK with Mr. Elliott. It is not easy to present these long Dickens' books - Oliver Twist would be easier - this is a long and if you don't care for all the legal situations can be dreary or boring. I think this presentation is entertaining enough not to be boring. I just LOVED Mr. Smallweed - it can be entertaining. There is always a child - Jo will break your heart here... I think we should be given a chance to judge for ourselves... I have to say I loved the show. Maybe if I read the book again as I usually do after seeing the movie maybe I can be more critical. In the meantime - I think it is a good presentation. 
 Noll's comfortable way of rolling out blunt comments often with expletives to describe things that he is more knowledgeable about than most is quite refreshing. There is one other character in the film that constantly tries to verbalize complicated issues using more language than necessary. This guy should never have been given a Thesaurus. Cut to Noll and you know you're in for a treat! The way the pioneers of big wave surfing are portrayed is very evocative of a lost era . Nevermind the fact that no one knows how these guys made a living much less took care of issues like medical care. The use of old film clips throughout was masterfully done. 
 I recently found a copy for $5 at a video store and snapped it up eagerly. While the music and (obviously) graphics aren't up to the standards of my favorite of the series Beyond the Mind's Eye I am still entranced by one segment: Stanley and Stella in Breaking the Ice . The music is brilliant and the emotions feel real. The clip on Odyssey's website doesn't have the story nor the music unfortunately. 
 I decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site. I would have to say it was worth the effort. However you should take heed that this film will go on for 210 minutes. If you don't have the staying power get it on tape and watch it over a couple of nights. Now to the film what I say will contain spoilers and if you don't mind here goes: Alexandre is a promiscuous bum a womanizer and a gigolo. He lives with an older woman called Marie. Marie owns a retail shop and she provides for Alex. Alex spends his days at caf¨¦s and restaurants. The story reveals that Alex had previously impregnated Gilberte whom he used to live with. Gilberte dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not love because Alex had abused and battered her. At this point Alex was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out Gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else. By chance Alexandre meets a nurse nymph called Veronika and they striked up a relationship. Veronika fell in love with Alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past. Marie and Veronika struggles for Alex's affection and had a m¨¦nage ¨¤ trois to boot. Finally at the end it's revealed Veronika is pregnant with Alex's child and Alex asked her to marry him. We assume (as aforesaid with Gilberte's situation) Alexandre will even get a job and be the provider for his new found love and family. There is hope! With the title of La Maman et la putain I deduce Jean Eustache was relating to Fran?oise Lebrun's character of Veronika. She was a whore and then she became the mother. Hence the mother and whore is the same person? Anyway what do I know! French films are mostly (not all) very chatty aimlessly political preaching theatrical insipid lamenting and full of quotes. Lebrun and L¨¦aud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed. Not a bad effort. 7/10. 
 First of all the only reason people keep bitching about this film is because they can't stand a few parts of the true story being altered . Well guess what? Peter Jackson's film wasn't a perfect rendition either. Well enough ranting. This is a very beautiful film. The backgrounds are gorgeous and taken from well known Tolkein artists. The film covers about half the trilogy (Fellowship of the Ring and up to the battle of Helms Deep in the Two Towers) and moves at a good pace. The voice casting is top notch and the most of the characters look like I imagined they would. Samwise is a bit too ugly for my tastes but Aragorn looks AWESOME. The film has a great score that completely supports the movie. If you enjoy good fantasy stories but hate reading (the books are even better) give this movie a try keeping in mind it was made 20 odd years ago. Also of particular note: Peter Jackson's adaption of Fellowship follows almost exactly the same strand as Ralph Bakshi's (Jackson has said many times how much he admired Bakshi's effort). 
 Another fun witty frothy RKO musical with Astaire and Rogers FOLLOW THE FLEET is a charming film. While it lacks the stand-out great tunes of SWNG TIME (although the final number Face the music and dance is one of the team's best and rightfully so) it is hugely enjoyable as these two could virtually do no wrong together in the 1930's. Once again the plot is lightweight and forgettable but watching Fred and Ginger dance together is sheer heaven. These two conveyed more romance and magic in dance than many couples in films do in a huge love scene. While there are better Fred and Ginger musicals this is certainly a must-see. 
 One is tempted to define the genre of Gert de Graaff's movie as `event of the thought' following the example of Merab Mamardashvili. The nominal storyline is a certain Bart Klever's torturous quest for that ephemeral substance which constitutes the essence of personality. The script for his new movie is taking shape simultaneously on his computer and in his own imagination. This film-monologue originated as a response to Fellini's `8 ?' and cost Gert de Graaff 13 years of work. Excitedly playing with real and fictional characters as well as with the audience it reveals the whimsical interconnection of the real and imaginary the paradoxical co-existence in two different galaxies: that of Guttenberg and that of MacLhuen. For some time we are apt to side with the script writer who believes that the cause of all misfortune is the damned stereotypes of mass mentality (`man' `catholic' `window washer'). And together with him we fall into a trap when the author-creator is finally faced with the insoluble dilemma: how can one eliminate from the future movie. Bart Klever? Just five minutes before the finale thanks to the common petty reproaches of the wife of the creator who is deeply immersed in work we realize that together with the main character we have again been `framed'. Really what is the price of the art for the sake of which it is acceptable to renounce one's own name and the day-to-day care for the young daughter? So who is he this Bart Klever? Is he a brilliant prophet or someone possessed like Frenhoffer from Balzac's masterpiece (just like the latter the script writer in the end erases from the computer memory everything has written)? Gert de Graaff suggests that we answer this question ourselves. 
 I must say this movie has given me a dual personality. I've been told again and again to SHUT UP and start speaking like a normal person. But it's very hard... no not the wang. Did you find that disgusting and disrespectful? Well get in the mood for a lot more. This movie is just filthy! It's not a film to show your grand-parents but you should show it to a teenager or some immature guy at your workplace. Anyway back to the voice mannerisms. Fortunately this site has some Ladies Man (did anyone at the studio notice that there's supposed to be a apostrophe(?) between the e and s?) so you can always have a fine little something to say to your boss or the cops. I have a sheet in my wallet. 
 Bleak House is hands down the finest adaptation of a Charles Dickens Novel ever put on screen. Alway one of My favorite novels I was exteremely pleased with this Television Mini Series. The late great Denholm Elliot was perfectly cast as the noble John Jardyce and Diana Rigg was sheer perfection as the doomed Ladty Dedlock. The film captures the essence of Dickens era and is extremely faithful to the book oly making minor plot cuts that do not effect the story. over all a brilliant moving and atmosphereic film. 
 I saw the movie and really could not stop my tears. Its tragedy that India has no such leaders after freedom who dare to do justice with their own children when they don't behave properly.. In current generation politicians bring their children's into politics without measuring their caliber and skills.. I remember the dialogue from Gandhi 'What kind of society we want to create/make with such people (about Harilal)?' No wonder that it will be a dream that India will hardly have such leader in this or next generation.. Einstein was right when he said about Gandhi that 'After 50 years one would hardly believe that such person with body soul and mind (Mahatma Gandhi) had ever lived on this earth.' I sincerely want to THANKS a LOT to Anil kapoor Feroze khan and all film actors/actresses for this wonderful movie about great person and relationship with his son. All father and son should watch this movie once and take some lessons for both roles. 
 This movie was charming. An accountant wants more from life than the approved conventional success. What makes it work so well and makes it so different from the standard dance movie is that it really isn't about becoming Great it is simply about finding a way to express one's self. The big triumph at the end is not the winning of a contest not the discovery of a whole new life style but the simple joy of doing what you want to fulfill the other parts of your life. No one is discovering their passion they are finding their quiet soul. The Japanese background makes the subtle oppression and secret life of ballroom dancing both understandable and personal. We can all see ourselves in the everyman. 
 This is one of the greatest sports movies ever made by Hollywood. What a wonderful story about one of the great sports figures of American history. What makes the story of James J. Corbett especially interesting is that Mr. Corbett introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day. In that respect James J. Corbett was truly innovated. But getting back to the movie all the performances were excellent. Alexis Smith was beautiful. Indeed she looked like Nicole Kidman. And although it's a period piece the story withstands the test of time; it has not gone stale. Ward Bond's portrayal of John L. Sullivan has to be one of the great portrayals of an actual sports figure in the history of movies and the boxing scenes are realistic well-staged and highly effective. That coupled with a great script makes this movie a must. 
 Heh if I tell you to compare The Dark Knight with some 18-years-old comics-adapted movie rated 5.9 will you call me crazy? That's just to catch your attention. Everyday I meet people complaining there are no good movies who seem to only know the recent blockbusters. It's never a bad thing to search and explore old movies especially those with good artistic values. Dick Tracy is one of those can't be easily outdated in terms of technology. The negative reviews mainly complained about DT's messed up story. But it appears to me that the storyline is quite clear and I had no problem following it. I didn't see the comic books yet I am not a huge US comic fan but I appreciate the top-notch film-making and performances. Maybe the expectations of most people were too high about the story it would tell. But if you see a movie casting Madonna and Warren Beatty together what would you expect. I had some scratches on my head and can't help but wonder did we really see the same movie? The title role although not as competent as it sounds still was able to pull him up and charm the audiences. Madonna was more express-less than breathless in her seductive role but added a lot of fun to the story. Al Pacino was funny and prodigy to himself. Apparently he's bold enough to go sarcastic on his previously successful roles. We can see a hybrid of Scarface Michael Corleone Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro punching our stomaches to make us laugh. And many thanks to make-ups. To me it's not bad at all. The surreal feeling really got me. 
 You do not get more dark or tragic than Othello and this movie captures the play fairly well with outstanding performances by Lawrence Fishburne and Irene Jacob. Fishburne's expresses to the viewer Othello's torment as he falls prey to Iago's lies very convincingly even providing a realistic epileptic episode. Jacob is the loving and loyal wife who becomes either the instrument of Iago's revenge against Othello or the object of his wrath (it is not clear which since no motive for Iago's behavior is offered). Although Kenneth Brannagh (sp?) displays his usual talent for Shakespeare in this movie he is somewhat marginalized. The characters of Cassio and Emilia also wander in and out of scenes even though they like Iago seem more crucial to the plot. I have not checked the movie against the play to see how many lines were cut out but I know that Shakespeare tends to develop his characters even the seemingly unimportant ones very well. If I had any criticism of the movie it would be that the story unfolds too quickly and that the relationships between some of the characters are not laid out more. The director had a great cast and no one offered a bad performance. The relationship between Cassio and Othello and that between Emilia and Desdemona need to be further developed earlier in the film. I have a feeling that they were closer to each other than the movie suggests although you get a sense of this very late into the movie. Also Othello and Desdemona need more time together. Although their anguish is convincing the amount of interaction they have with each other makes it seem like they just met. On the other hand maybe the did just meet---like Romeo and Juliet. In brief: good performances too short. 
 Brazilian films often get more positive appraisals than they actually deserve. Rather incredibly Contra Todos (Against Everybody) (original title which the producers discarded: God Against Everybody) got very low GPA (grade point average) in this website. It seems to be bluntly rejected by female spectators at large. Actually it is not so brutal. I mean as far as graphical violence is concerned. Its brutality is intrinsic as it portrays would-be lumpens I mean underdog citizens who in fact possess high-tech equipment who coldly perform murder orders in exchange of grana gra¨²da . Is this post-modern man? Is his/her only worry a quick almost impersonal ultra permissive lay amidst over satiating meals ? The picture is probably the best Brazilian film of 2004 so far. Its shining editing style ¨¤ la Godard its curious soundtrack counterpoints its more than efficient overall cast and above all its original narration with subtle non-chronological hidden points that only come to light in the epilogue deserve at least an 8 mark. 
 I just finished watching this film and found it very enjoyable. It is a quiet little film that doesn't overwhelm you with special effects or big performances. It simply takes you into the lives of the people living in a small hamlet in the backwoods of North Carolina. Henry Thomas gives a good performance as Raymond Toker a young loner who finds a baby abandoned in the woods. Toker's search for the baby's parents takes him on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life. David Srathairn plays Truman Lester a slimy conman with an ulterior motive. And David plays the bad guy to perfection. There is much more to this film than first meets the eye. Filmed on location in North Carolina and with a wonderful sound track of traditional music it is worth watching. 
 Frankly this movie has gone over the heads of most of its detractors. The opposite of perdition (being lost) is salvation (being saved) and this movie is one of a very few to deal with those two concepts. The movie also explores the love and disappointments that attend the father-son relationship. It should be noted at the outset that none of these are currently fashionable themes. The premise is that the fathers in the move hit-man Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) and his crime boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) love their sons and will do anything to protect them. But Rooney's son Connor is even more evil than the rest. He kills one of Rooney's loyal soldiers to cover up his own stealing from his father. When Connor learns that Sullivan's son Michael witnessed it he mistakenly kills Sullivan's other son (and Sullivan's wife) in an attempt to silence witnesses. Sullivan decides he wants revenge at any price even at the terribly high price of perdition. Rooney who in one scene curses the day Connor was born refuses to give up his son Connor to Sullivan and hires a contract killer named Maguire (Jude Law) to kill Sullivan and his son. So Rooney joins his son Connor on the Road to Perdition. For the rest of the movie accompanied by his surviving son young Michael Sullivan pursues Connor Rooney down the Road to Perdition and Maguire pursues Sullivan. When Sullivan confronts Rooney in a Church basement and demands that he give up Connor because Connor murdered his family Rooney says - Michael there are only murderers in this room .. and there's only one guarantee none of us will see Heaven. As the movie ends somewhat predictably one character is saved and one character repents. I'm not a big Tom Hanks fan but he does step out of character to play hit-man Sullivan convincingly giving a subtle and laconic performance. Newman does well as the old Irish gangster Rooney showing a hard edge in his face and manner his eyes haunted by Connor's misdeeds. Jude Law plays Maguire in a suitably creepy way. Tyler Hoechlin plays Young Michael naturally and without affectation. The cinematography constantly played light off from darkness echoing the themes of salvation and perdition. The camera drew from a palette of greens and greys. The greys belonged to the fathers and the urban landscapes of Depression era Illinois. The greens belonged to the younger sons and that State's rural flatlands. Thomas Newman's lush sonorous and haunting music had faint Irish overtones and was played out in Copland-like arrangements. The sets were authentic mid-Western urban - factories churches. The homes shone with gleaming woodwork. The excellence of the movie lies in its generation of a unique feeling out of its profound themes distinctive acting and enveloping music and cinematography. The only negative was a slight anti-gun message slipped into the screenplay y the movie's only nod to political correctness. I give this movie a10 out of 10; in time it will be acknowledged as a great film. 
 This Batman movie isn't quite as good as Batman mask of The Phantasm and Batman and Mr. Freeze subzero But it is still a good installment to the Batman cartoons I say it is equally good as Batman Beyond The Movie. This movie is good for all the same reasons The storyline is good not quite as good as the other one's but still pretty good it has lots of action in it The Cartoon effects are good The voice of actors are really good such as Kevin Conroy as Batman/ Bruce Wayne Tara Strong as Barbra Gordon Efrem Zimbalist Jr. Eli Marienthal as Robin. The villains are good such as Kyra Sedgwick as Batwoman David Ogden Stiers as The Pequin Hector Elizondo as Bane. So I am sure you will not be disappointed with batman Mystery of The Batwomen. So make sure that you rent or buy batman Mystery of The Batwoman the movie because it is really good. Overall score: ******* out of ********** *** out of ***** 
 This movie can be described in those 2 words just unbelievable . This is the best movie ever made I just cant see why this movie isnt in the top 250. I also can't see why anybody would not love Scarface. Anyways if you havnt seen it it is a must buy. 
 This was different that's for sure. Just look at the cast! Talk about oddballs. William H. Macy and Ben Stiller were the stars although a bunch of actors almost share the spotlight in this farce about superhero-wannabees. The most outrageous was played by Paul Reubens of Pee Wee Herman fame. There is lots of humor garish colors and no lulls. It's a pretty entertaining lightweight comedy with nothing but goofy characters all of whom want to be heroes a la Superman Batman Spiderman you name. They have talents in strange areas however that the real heroes don't (and don't want to!). It's silly but you know that going on. It's also a film you can watch in installments and not really miss any continuity. It's a long movie for one so hectic so taking a break here and there is okay. The language was tame so kids could enjoy this too. In fact I don't recall any swearing in here except the guy in the theater next to me who kept uttering What a dumb f---ing movie. I thought it was fun two hours but I'd rather watch it on DVD and take a few breaks. 
 This is a film i decided to go and see because I'm a huge fan of adult animation. I quite often find that when a film doesn't evolve around a famous actor or actress but rather a story or style it allows the film to be viewed as a piece of art rather than a showcase of the actors ability to differ his styles. This film is certainly more about style than story. While i found the story interesting (a thriller that borrows story and atmosphere from films such as Blade Runner and many anime films) it was a bit hard to follow at times and didn't feel like it all came together as well as it could have. It definitely had a mixed sense of French Animation and Japanese Anime coming together. Whether thats a good thing or not is up to the viewer. Visually this film is a treat for the eyes and in that sense a work of art. If you like adult animation or would like to see a film that is different from most films out at the moment. I would recommend it. All i can say is that i enjoyed the experience of the film but did come away slightly disappointed because it could have been better 
 I have loved this movie ever since it's debut in 1981! I have lost track of how many times I have seen it! It never fails to make me laugh or cheer me up if i am feeling down. The three leads are fantastic and the script is priceless plus how do you not get nostalgic hearing the theme song? I think I quote this movie without realizing it. I basically know the entire script so when someone is watching it for the first time I have to hold back saying something about how funny the next line it. I can't even narrow it down although Sir John's character probably gets the most memorable ones. The famous I'll alert the media when Arthur announces his intention to take a bath is still priceless but the list is truly endless. The scene's at Arthur's soon to be fianc¨¦'s father's house are a scream particularly his interactions with the moose. Do yourself a favour and see this movie! 
 One of several musicals about sailors on leave it is the usual sailor meets girl complications ensue sorted out happily kind of plot. It proceeds along smoothly enough but it does drag in places too. The dialogue is not as zippy as 'Top Hat' for example and Randolph Scott seems out of place. There are compensations. It has some of Irving Berlin's choicest songs including 'Let Yourself Go' 'I'm Putting all My Eggs in One Basket' and 'Let's Face the Music and Dance'. It has Fred and Ginger who when they are dancing take any film into heavenly heights and they don't disappoint here. They do a snappy tap dance a knockabout comic dance and a swirling graceful dance all in the same film! Great versatility and artistry. It also has Harriet Hilliard who is rather good in her role. She had a varied career becoming the more famous Harriet Nelson with Ozzie. Here she is touching without being sentimental.Her two songs are simply and effectively delivered. She makes a good contrast with Ginger but you can believe they are sisters in the film. More tightening up have made the film even better. Pretty good though. 
 There's a good reason that Walter Pidgeon is warning off Leslie Nielson and his crew from the relief ship stuff he dare not dream about. As Doctor Edward Morbius Pidgeon is the last survivor of an expedition that came to this planet 20 years earlier. Since that time he married another member of the expedition and had a daughter Anne Francis. They are the only humans left on this planet which was once the home world of an ancient civilization known as the Krell. The records as deciphered by Pidgeon indicate the Krell came to a cataclysmic ending of unknown origin. The machinery they left behind is still functioning. Maybe functioning too well as members of the relief party start dying and in a particular gruesome fashion. I see all kinds of speculation about a remake and this is one film not to remake because it's as fresh as it was in 1956. The terms would change we would now say warp speed instead of hyper drive courtesy of the enduring popularity of Star Trek. We might not see the men in the relief expedition in a flying saucer like space ship. It might look a lot more like the Starship Enterprise or the Ship from 2001 A Space Odyssey. It's interesting to look at science fiction films from different generations and see how are conceptions of the future do change. The story behind Forbidden Planet is a timeless one about mortal beings trying to play God. You can't write about Forbidden Planet without commenting on Robby the Robot. This mechanical marvel put together by Pidgeon with the knowledge he gained from studying the Krell was quite the hit back in the day. He got a new lease on life in the sixties with the character of the Robot from Lost In Space. His scenes with Earl Holliman who plays the cook on the space ship and his complying with Earl's request for some home spirits are very funny. Robby and the other special effects were nominated for an Oscar but lost to The Ten Commandments and the parting of the Red Sea. Forbidden Planet's bad luck to run up against a Hollywood founder like Cecil B. DeMille. Classicists among you will recognize Forbidden Planet as a futuristic reworking of The Tempest which when you think about it could have been Shakespeare's one venture into science fiction. My favorite among the cast is Warren Stevens who's sacrifice enables Leslie Nielsen to learn exactly what he's dealing with. Never miss this one whenever it's broadcast. 
 Olivier Kosentsev Richardson Coranado Zefferelli and Almerayeda have all directed Hamlet but Branagh's the only one who got it right. This is the only film of Hamlet that contains the full four hours of William Shakespeare's masterpiece and gives a unique feel to the whole story. Not many directors could pull this off without boring their audience but Branagh's skillful use of bravora film style and stunt casting allows people to see the importance of the scenes that are usually cut out. Examples of this include Gerarde Depardue as Ranyaldo whos entire purpose in the film was to simply say yes my lord as Polonius asks him to spy on Leartes. This also included Billy Crystal as the grave digger Robin Williams as Osric Jack Lemmon as Marcellous and Charlton Heston as the actor. Branagh's performance of the Act 4 scene 4 soliloquy (Which again is usually cut out) is nothing short of c cinematic marvel as the camera slowly pulls back as the intensity grows. It is a scene that literally made me want to jump out of my chair and start applauding. Branagh is the only film maker that understood the importance of every scene in this film and knew how to convey that importance to the general audience. This is a must see for everyone who enjoy's good story telling brilliant acting and incredible direction. All of these part of William Shakespeares greatest triumph. 
 If you're going to put on a play within the prison walls why not go for the top playwright William Shakespeare? And if you are going to choose your cast from a whole lot of criminals serving long sentences for the most heinous crimes you can be sure there will be plenty of time for rehearsals. In a Kentucky Correctional Prison a courageous project such as this was undertaken with amazing results. This film shows how it was all done?.the casting?.the rehearsals?.the set and costumes?and the final presentation of Shakespeare's play The Tempest. It had not occurred to me before but there is an analogy between the setting of the play and the correctional prison. In the play the ship-wrecked characters are confined to an island with no contact with the outside world. Prison life too is much like that. With a simple painted back drop of a surrounding seascape the characters in a most pleasing assortment of costumes bellow out their lines to an approving audience may be not quite as Shakespeare intended but with good heart and true sincerity for sure. More interesting than the play itself were the little cameos of each man behind his character. One inmate saw the play as a lesson in forgiveness another as a redemption of his sins. It was quite moving to see the men wipe away a tear as they spoke of murder shooting and strangulation. One had the feeling that they would all like to wind back the clock and reconsider their brutal actions. However (as someone said) the past was past and the present was the beginning of a new future. At least the play gave temporary relief from the depressing thoughts of past events. The prison authorities should be applauded for allowing the play to take place. Such an event would put Kentucky on the map and hopefully other prisons might follow their good example. It seems to me that everyone stands to benefit?not only the Kentucky prison but the prisoners themselves who need to find new confidence and self esteem and be prepared for the day when they go out on parole. 
 Excellent writing and wild cast. The tech is poor but it's obviously very low budget. Looks like they didn't cut the negative but had to release on a video output. In any case one of the most inventive comedies I've seen lately. The screenwriter in particular is fine. 
 Saw this as a young naive punk when it was first released. Had me snifflin' like a baby as I left the theatre trying not to let anyone see. So when I saw it again now in '07 I knew what to expect & the sobs were ready & primed as their required moment approached. Thankfully this time I was at home. What I hadn't remembered from my youthful viewing- or perhaps hadn't noticed because of it was the technical brilliance of this movie. The use of flashbacks which tell so much story without resorting to dialogue. The camera work which seemed to place the viewer together with the characters in the scene. Think of the opening when Joe is crossing the street to the diner the camera pans behind the woman & child sitting on a bench in the foreground framing the street scene. The story itself & the characters - seedy sad & brutally real. It is very touching to be drawn so closely into a human drama such as this with people most of us would likely spurn. Then again Joe & Ratso could be any of us. Must have been '70 when I saw it. I recall that upon leaving the theatre I was impelled to find the company of friends. All these years later I'm glad I'm not alone tonight. This is one hell of a great movie. 
 I saw this film on True Movies (which automatically made me sceptical) but actually - it was good. Why? Not because of the amazing plot twists or breathtaking dialogue (of which there is little) but because actually despite what people say I thought the film was accurate in it's depiction of teenagers dealing with pregnancy. It's NOT Dawson's Creek they're not graceful cool witty characters who breeze through sexuality with effortless knowledge. They're kids and they act like kids would. They're blunt awkward and annoyingly confused about everything. Yes this could be by accident and they could just be bad actors but I don't think so. Dermot Mulroney gives (when not trying to be cool) a very believable performance and I loved him for it. Patricia Arquette IS whiny and annoying but she was pregnant and a teenagers? The combination of the two isn't exactly lavender on your pillow. The plot was VERY predictable and but so what? I believed them his stress and inability to cope - her brave yet slightly misguided attempts to bring them closer together. I think the characters acted by anyone else WOULD indeed have been annoying and unbelievable but they weren't. It reflects the surreality of the situation they're in that he's sitting in class and she walks on campus with the baby. I felt angry at her for that I felt angry at him for being such a child and for blaming her. I felt it all. In the end I loved it and would recommend it. Watch out for the scene where Dermot Mulroney runs from the disastrous counselling session - career performance. 
 Director Paul Verhoeven's American vehicles are of varied quality but most of the films he made in his native country are indisputable masterworks. This is the story of alcoholic (and bi-sexual) writer who moves in with a beautiful rich and very strange woman. But the lady does not know that he is only interested in meeting the woman's handsome male lover. In the meantime the writer is plagued with strange visions - at first they look like hallucinations triggered by alcohol abuse but he soon begins to realize that he is actually experiencing some kind of premonitions. Fascinating Hitchcockian thriller very original and provocative. I love films that make you think they are about something but then you realize they are about something completely different. This is one of those movies; a thriller during the first half and a quasi-religious surrealist saga during the second half. Very erotic original and blasphemous not for kids or people that go to church every Sunday. Great cinematography by future director Jan de Bont. Highly Reommended! 
 Some people say this is the best film that PRC ever released I'm not too sure about that since I have a fond place in my heart for some of their mysteries. I will say that this is probably one of the most unique films they or any other studio major or minor ever released. The plot is simple. The ghost of a wrongly executed ferryman has returned to the swamp to kill all those who lynched him as well as all of their off spring. Into this mix comes the granddaughter of one ghosts victims the current ferryman. She takes over the ferry business as the ghost closes in on the man she loves. Shrouded in dense fog and set primarily on the single swamp set this is more musical poem than regular feature film.Listen to the rhythms of the dialog especially in the early scenes their is poetical cadence to them. Likewise there is a similar cadence to the camera work as it travels back and forth across the swamp as if crossing back and forth across the door way between life and death innocence and guilt. The film reminds me of an opera or oratorio or musical object lesson more than a normal horror film. Its an amazing piece of film making that is probably unique in film history. This isn't to guild the Lilly. This is a low budget horror/mystery that tells you a neat little story that will keep you entertained. Its tale of love and revenge is what matters here not the poetical film making and it holds you attention first and foremost (the technical aspects just being window dressing.) If there is any real flaw its the cheapness of the production. The fog does create a mood but it also hides the fact that this swamp is entirely on dry land. The constant back and forth across it is okay for a while but even after 58 minutes you do wish that we could see something else. Don't get me wrong I do like the film a great deal. Its a good little film that I some how wish was slightly less poverty stricken. Its definitely worth a look if you can come across it. 
 This films makes no pretentious efforts to hide its true genre -- a campy B movie. It will flat out tell you in the beginning the definition of campy. It should have also given the adjective meaning of cheese. But the two come together in this film in ways that make you go Hmmmmm... that's so stupid! and then have you laughing. For example there is a scene back in 16th Century Japan which shows a couple of samurai walking in the foreground of a temple. In the background of the temple there are several tourists looking off in the distance in slippers and shorts. Hmmmm... hahahah! I could not stop laughing. And the acting goes from decent to bearable to oh my Lord but that's what makes it funny. You'll see some decent actors and then find others really terrible. I have to digress somewhat though because I have seen Stephanie Sanchez in several plays and she is awesome. Her air time in the film was pretty short though. I have also seen Bryan Yamasaki in several plays in the islands during my visits and he's also better in theatre than in this movie. Anyhow it's an entertaining film if you've got nothing to do on a weekday evening. 
 Life stinks is a parody of life and death happiness and depression. The black and the white always present in our lives. Mel Brooks performance is brilliant as always and the other actors work is fine too. This movie has some Capra flavor that¡äs why is so good. There are some unforgettable gags such as the one when Brooks tries to earn some money dancing in the street and all the people passing by just ignore him or when he meets a funny crazy man who believes is Paul Getty and then start arguing and slapping each other. If you haven¡ät seen it you don¡ät know what you¡äve missed. This movie tells us about the old and eternal struggle of the poor against the rich. The only difference between this movie and reality is that this movie has a happy ending and reality hasn¡ät. Yes indeed Life Stinks. 
 I loved this exiting republic serial! The story was one of the best I have ever seen! Even tough the picture quality was not of the best but OK. The fencing in this serial is also a bit bad but not terrible. They only should have practised some more. As I said the story is GREAT! You're just sitting there and waiting to find out who Don Del Oro is! The theme music is excellent! It's the same guy who maid the music for Walt Disney's version of Zorro who maid the Fightin Legion music. Costumes and buildings are very good. Zorro is really cool and so are the legioners! I highly recommend this serial. Buy it! I love that Reed Hadley plays Zorro! He is funny smart and brave! Mark: 6. 
 One of the best (if not the best) Stephen King's screenings. Dark as dark can be surprising non-hollywood ending terrifying atmosphere amazing book adaptation outstanding cast educational (don't play with afterlife) in short - everything an excellent horror should be... My favorite horror movie straight 10+. 
 If you a purist don't waste your time - otherwise hold onto your hat and enjoy the adventure. I loved the Stewart Granger/Deborah Kerr version - I've seen it dozens of times but this film is every bit as good only different. I won't detail the differences because it would spoil the film. Also it is a pleasure to see Alison Doody again (I'm a huge Indiana Jones fan) Patrick Swayze is good as Quatermain and the supporting cast is superb. I find the quality of the supporting cast one of the trademarks of a Hallmark Production and this film was no exception. The cinematography is splendid and the score is perfect. If you are looking for entertainment you won't be disappointed. 
 Anyone who doesn't like this film is one who is afraid to explore his or her own demons. This film does make the viewer a little uncomfortable at times but that is its intention. It asks you to look at your own life and confront the obstacles head on like Lou eventually does. It asks you to overcome the fear of perception and become who you are meant to be. Bret Carr holds up a mirror unlike any filmmaker has. The intention and the message is clear and profound. People's apprehension about this film stems only from their own insecurities. An open-minded viewer takes this inspirational message and runs with it. Sometimes a life- changing realization DOES come in a flash -- a light bulb going on. This story is real and changes the lives if its viewers in a real way. 
 I've just seen The Saint Strikes Back for the first time and found it quite good. This was George Sanders's first appearance as the Saint where he replaces Louis Hayward. In this one the Saint is sent to San Francisco to investigate a shooting at a night club. With the help of his acquaintance Inspector Fernack who has come down from New York they help a daughter of a crime boss. Joining Sanders in the cast are Wendy Barrie and Jonathan Hale. Not a bad Saint movie. Worth seeing. Rating: 3 stars out of 5. 
 What can be said really... The Tenant is a first-class thriller wrought with equal amounts of suspense and full-blown paranoia. It's an intricately-plotted film--every detail seems included for a reason--even though the plot seldom makes sense and much of it is never even addressed in an objective manner. Therefore we are left with the increasingly unstable Trelkovsky (Polanski)--a meek Polish man who has obtained an apartment due to the previous tenant's suicide--to guide us through a world of escalating fear and uncertainty. After an apartment-warming party thrown by a group of obnoxious coworkers Trelkovsky comes under increased seemingly inexplicable scrutiny by the fellow occupants in his building; the rest of the film chronicles his mental deterioration and gives us a thorough mindfu*k on par with the later efforts of David Lynch. The Tenant however is more brooding and sinister laced with unexpected comic relief fine performances and a truly haunting score. It's a movie that's better experienced than described so hop to it. 
 Entertaining Jim Belushi vehicle a modern cockeyed version of It's A Wonderful Life. Michael Caine plays a sort-of angel who lets Belush see what life would have been like if he had made it big . Jim is at his best with a good story and supporting cast; seems like real chemistry between him and Hamilton. Not an Oscar contender but good warm-hearted fun. 
 Of course by any normal standard of film criticism Soldier is a very poor film indeed. Kurt Russell is a futuristic super soldier raised since birth to kill but then made obsolete after being bettered by a bunch of really super soldiers at a dangly hoop ruck that looks a bit like a Gladiators contest without the crash mats. Abandoned on a junk planet he's befriended by a community of naff space hippies that teach him about gardening family life and um breasts. Kurt doesn't talk much. Finally the really super soldiers turn up and kill the hippies by shooting them in the back while they're running away. Kurt gets angry and kills everyone. A planet gets totalled. The end. Unless the Academy start a new category for Best Explosion Soldier is not going to win any awards. However as ludicrous as it is it remains an enjoyable experience. The military hardware is the coolest since Aliens (the APC's especially) and at 90 minutes long it doesn't outstay its welcome. Please note that the below mark is only a guide. Knock five points off if you intend to take it seriously and discount one more if you don't like miniguns. 7 out of 10 
 A bizarre and brilliant combination of talents between the director Robert Siodmak and Ella Raines as a secretary trying to save her boss from the electric chair by tracking down a mysterious phantom woman and Franchot Tone as a crazed and murderous sculptor. As well there are some fascinating smaller parts played by Elisha Cook Jr as a drugged out trap drummer as well as the other characters who make up parts of the conspiracy. If you're used to seeing Raines in more wholesome parts she's allowed to go overboard here especially in her scenes with Cook. Franchot Tone also plays someone very different and though it isn't a convincing part he acts phenomenally. While the conspiracy is too contrived the film has real atmosphere and is very interesting. 
 Garam Masala is one of the funniest film I've seen in ages. Akshay Kumar is excellent as the womaniser who has affairs with 3 girls and engaged at the same time. John Abraham is Amusing at times and this is one of his best works so far. Paresh Rawail is superb as usual in most of his films. The director Priyadarshan has delivered great Movies in the past. Hera Pheri Hungama and Hulchul being some of the Best. Garam Masala is his funniest film he has made. The three newcomer actresses are average. Rimi sen doesn't get much scope in this movie. I was impressed to see how Priyadarshan made a movie with a simple storyline of a guy having a affair with 3 girls at the same time. All 3 girls have a day off in the same day and end up in the same house. Packed with loads of Laughs this is one Non stop Entertainer. 
 Burlinson and Thornton give an outstanding performance in this movie along with Dennehy. Although it is at first thought to be only about love it really goes down deeper than that. The beauty of nature captures this movie placing among one of the best I have ever seen. The horse scenes are absolutely fantastic!! Any horse-lovers out there will love this movie! 
 I love cartoons. They can show things that films with 'real' actors and scenery cannot - though computer effects are changing that more and more. They can push the boundaries of satire ('The Simpsons') good taste ('South Park') spectacle ('Aladdin') or reality ('Toy Story'). There are some good examples of this in 'Ice Age' such as when we see a motley herd of now-extinct mammals migrating across countryside chatting like old friends. Such scenes are a pleasure to watch as we get the feeling of both the familiar and the strange at the same time usually in a way that makes us laugh. While Ice Age is not as good as the top animated movies of all time it's a really fun film. Sit back enjoy the deliberate anachronisms the lovely backgrounds and the belly-laughs. The story follows Manfred the grumpy mammoth Sid an idiotic sloth and Diego a sabretooth tiger as they take a human baby back to his tribe - for very different reasons. On the way naturally they have a whole lot of problems. Also popping up throughout the journey is Scrat history's unluckiest rodent who is desperately trying to bury an acorn for the winter: in glaciers on top of dead trees in ice-caves. His opening scene is a classic. It's a simple story with a very predictable end and a middle that is just a series of funny incidents with some character-building moments thrown in but some of the scenes such as the nappy-changing or the dodos are hilarious the animals are likeable and it looks good. There is one quite touching moment too when cave paintings of mammoths come to life in front of Manfred's eyes. Not a must-see but good for a fun hour or so. 7/10 
 The reason why people say that this movie scared them is because it did!! That means the movie purpose was felt by a few who did see it. When I first saw this Movie it scared me and made me think about life and religion. This is not a blood and gore scary type movie but the kind that you would think that it may be possible for things to happen the way the movie was written. Of course non believers will say its only a sci-fi movie. Truth is this movie is a must have for your thriller collection even if it does have a religious view. If you are a fan of classic thrillers (Omen..etc) this is one of them and its a must have. I never saw the sequel (Distant Thunder) but I believe it picks up where this movie ends. 
 I wasn't born until 4 years after this wonderful show first aired but luckily I managed to catch the reruns of the mid 90's and the rest is history......I was hooked. The premise was pretty simple; two hardened Nemesis agents Richard Barrett and Craig Stirling ( William Gaunt and Stuart Damon) are partnered up with an expert (if not young) Doctor and Biologist (Sharron Macready) to head behind the bamboo curtain to retrieve a dangerous biological agent from being used by red china. Whilst making their escape their plane is hit by machine gun fire and they crash in the heart of the Himalayas where their lives are saved by a mysterious and previously undiscovered civilisation who heal and enhance the senses of the trio thus setting the scene for many exciting adventures to come... The series lasted for 30 hour long episodes and I guess it was its relatively short lived one season run that has set it up for cult status. Monty Berman the producer was notorious for making things as cheaply as possible and sometimes the show suffered for this with incredibly tacky sets - particularly in Episodes such as Happening ( a studio deputising for the Australian outback) and the 'snow' sets of Operation Deep Freeze and The Beginning but if you can get past this and focus on the characters and the story lines the show was really a lot of fun. It had a great mix of adventure and plenty of deadpan humour (mainly from some terrific one liners from William Gaunt). The chemistry from the three leads was fantastic - you get the sense that they were really having a lot of fun making the show and this is borne out in the 2005 reunion documentary where the three reunite after over 35 years to reminisce about the show (and laugh about Anthony Nicholls awful wig!!). They all shared equal screen time and all had their moments to shine. I have to say I was always a Richard Barrett fan - I loved his sardonic humour along with that dangerous edge - he was certainly a man you didn't cross and those eyes........the bluest eyes you would probably see on TV. I have also followed Bill Gaunts career with interest since. However Craig Stirling certainly would have had his legion of female fans and I am sure Alexandra Bastedo had a whole queue of male fans swooning over her too. The show also had a plethora of guest stars to entice with including Donald Sutherland Jeremy Brett Peter Wyngarde Burt Kwouk Anton Rodgers Kate O'Mara Jenny Linden Paul Eddington and Colin Blakely. Notable episodes for me were : Auto Kill The Interrogation The Fanatics The Mission and The Gilded Cage but I am sure every one has their personal favourites. If you do get a chance to watch this show for the first time or to re watch it after many years remember to watch it in the context of the time it was made and just sit back and enjoy - the characters and the chemistry from the three leads is what made this wonderful show for me and I don't think I will ever tire of it. Enjoy! 
 Gerard Phillipe is absolutely perfect in this movie funny tender brave and lover.He gives a superior dimension to a movie which is even a masterpiece as much by the other actors (Gina Lollobrigida:miaoooou!!) as by the story or the rhythm. Never boring always creating new emotions: for me the best french movie of all time. 
 I felt compelled to write a review for Space Cobra as it has received a good score of 7.3 stars but only a few of the reviews at the time of me writing this were particularly positive. A strange situation and hopefully my positive review will point people towards this old and mostly forgotten Anime movie. Space cobra is the funky tale of a smuggler and rogue who becomes involved with the three sisters of an ancient and dead planet and an evil force who wants to harness the planets powers. This is an old movie and the animation shows but what it lacks in modern sophistication it makes up with an abundance of charm. Space Cobra is very much geared to a western audience and very easy to watch. There are few if any references to specific Japanese culture and great for Anime novices to watch and enjoy. Space Cobra himself is witty and likable. I cannot say how much of this is due to the English dub or the intentions of the maker but this is one of the few Japanese comedy characters that I find truly funny. The style is very sixties Barbarellish with a fantastic soundtrack by Yello. The style is colourful and imaginative and there is constant action to move the story along. The strangest aspect of this movie is how it begins as a comedy and ends on a very downbeat dramatic note. I cannot think of another Anime or general movie that has been able to do this so seamlessly and convincingly. You barely realise that it is happening but it is done so subtly and seems perfectly natural. You also really feel the characters went on a journey and they're lives were changed by the whole experience. Check out if you can. 
 The third Muppet movie is perhaps the most relaxed and pleasing with the gang taking their modest college musical to the bright (yet volatile) lights of Broadway filled with typically na?ve optimism. Of course their first attempt fails and Kermit (leader of the group and author of the show) blows his top; so the others all go their separate ways so that he won't have to feel responsible for them. Kermit himself befriends a young wannabe fashion designer making ends meet by serving food at her father's diner (the old man then has a line in particularly tortuous non-sequiturs!). We get the usual cameo appearances by a variety of stars: Art Carney (as a producer) James Coco (as an overzealous dog owner) Dabney Coleman (as a confidence trickster) Elliott Gould (who was also in THE MUPPET MOVIE [1979]) Gregory Hines Liza Minnelli (as herself ? having her portrait at a classy restaurant replaced by Kermit's sporting fake moustache as an ostensibly celebrated entrepreneur in a ruse to attract publicity to the Muppets' show) Brooke Shields and even director John Landis (in possibly the film's funniest scene as a Broadway producer before whom Kermit appears acting streetwise and chummy and hilariously donning shades and an Afro wig!). The other Muppets more or less go through their typical paces with (regrettably) less space given to Gonzo this time around; while Miss Piggy is something of an acquired taste with me the scenes in which the latter spies on what she takes to be Kermit's romance with the waitress ? and especially her violent reaction to this ? are undeniably funny. What disappoints however is the climactic show itself (after a fairly redundant midsection wherein Kermit gets amnesia and eventually picks up advertising on Madison Avenue) which rather than the expected splashy routines procures nothing more original than the wedding ceremony of Kermit and his eternal flame Miss Piggy! 
 This is a movie that has a lot of things that only Japanese people can understand. Even well translated there are some things that are obviously private jokes or regional symbolism. My guess is that it tried to send a message of some sort but that just got wasted on me. What I felt that is basically this is a mediocre movie with nice special effects. Some kid becomes The one and in the end has almost no relevance to a yokai war that makes no sense whatsoever anyway. It would have been nice to understand what the hell they were talking about but between the Azumi bean washing yokai and the one that looks like a big tongued umbrella (Rihanna eat your heart out!) I couldn't really discern the plot. Bottom line: nice visuals the kid screams a lot the river princess is terrible cute and the rest is crap. 
 Paul Reiser steps away from the standup comedy spotlight to write a warmly humorous and gently tender story about family - what we see and what we don't see what we expect and what surprises us. THE THING ABOUT MY FOLKS doesn't set any new standards for film but it is a fine little story well told that reminds us about the significant bonds that family represents. Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) has been a workaholic at times pushing his wife Muriel (Olympia Dukakis) his daughters (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan) and his son Ben (Paul Reiser) into the background. One day Muriel leaves a note that after years of marriage she is leaving! Her daughters along with Ben's wife Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins) immediately begin the search for her whereabouts leaving the confused and hurt and disgruntle Sam to sort things out on a road trip with son Ben. The road trip becomes a time for the two men to learn who each other is and what they each mean to their status as father and son and as family members. Sam relaxes for the first time in his life and introduces the now workaholic Ben to the pleasures and fun of living. The trip comes to an end with a phone call about the whereabouts of Muriel and why she left and the regrouping of the wiser family draws the story's warm ending. All is not what it seemed: it's better and well different. Falk and Reiser play off each other like the pros they are but in many ways the film belongs to the brief moments when Olympia Dukakis is on screen reminding us that she is one of our strongest matriarchs on film. Well worth viewing. Grady Harp 
 This tale based on two Edgar Allen Poe pieces ( The Fall of the House of Usher Dance of Death (poem) ) is actually quite creepy from beginning to end. It is similar to some of the old black-and-white movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house (for example The Cat and the Canary The Old Dark House Night of Terror and so on). Boris Karloff plays a demented inventor of life-size dolls that terrorize the guests. He dies early in the film (or does he ? ) and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences. I won't go into too much detail here but it is definitely a must-see for fans of old dark house mysteries. Watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room. Dan Basinger 8/10 
 It takes guts to make a movie on Gandhi in India in which he is not shown as a man who could do no wrong.This movie shows how a Mahatma failed to be a decent father(at least in the eyes of his son). The performances are terrific the cinematography fantastic the direction fabulous but the film drags.If the intention was to make this movie without any box-office expectations which i assume is the case here then its a brilliant attempt but if the makers were expecting this to be a commercial success then the film's fate was doomed the day they chose this subject.. 20 yrs from now this movie will be remembered for the brilliant portrayal of Harilal by Akshaye Khanna.He deserves an Oscar nomination for this one..And honestly his is not the only performance worth applauding Shefali Chhaya is terrific too.. Watch the scene where Harilal hears about his father's death.No dialogues No screaming but a speechless shot by Khanna.Its one of the finest scenes ever shot in the history of Cinema Gandhi My Father is not at all exciting cinema but yes its excellent cinema and a must watch.Brilliant Attempt.. 
 Though I saw this movie years ago its impact has never left me. Stephen Rea's depiction of an invetigator is deep and moving. His anguish at not being able to stop the deaths is palpable. Everyone in the cast is amazing from Sutherland who tries to accommodate him and provide ways for the police to coordinate their efforts to the troubled citizen x. Each day when we are bombarded with stories of mass murderers I think of this film and the exhausting work the people do who try to find the killers. 
 This is the only full length feature film about the world of bridge. I found the first 10 minutes a bit slow but after that the movie is absolutely perfect in describing professional bridge players and how they go about earning a living. Some of the scenes are very funny. I don't think that a non-bridge player would get the charm of this movie. Some of the dresses are really beautiful pity the movie is in black and white - I can only imagine what they would look like in color. The way the media are portrayed is absolutely hilarious. There is no way on earth bridge will ever be like that. Watch it as soon as you can and tell your friends about it. 
 So Todd Sheets once stated that he considers his 1993 shot-on-video Z-epic Zombie Bloodbath to be his first feature film. Anyone who's ever seen a little beauty called Zombie Rampage knows exactly how untrue that statement is. I mean what makes this one that much more superior? Well then again Zombie Rampage doesn't include that mullet guy now does it? For one to comprehend exactly why Zombie Bloodbath is actually considered worth a damn one must remember what the 90's were like for lovers of bad horror. A decade that all but said goodbye to B and Z-cinema as we knew it. Technological advances awkward trends and the internet would abolish the mysterious charms of the s.o.v.'s big-boxed golden years. And anything remotely resembling quality schlock was all too self-aware for it's own good basically defeating the purpose. Luckily not everyone changes with the times. Enter Zombie Bloodbath. And I guess this is the part where I explain the same exact premise from 500 other zombie flicks from the last 40 years. Alright so Some kind of accident at a nuclear plant infects everyone in sight turning them into flesh-eating zombies who go on a rampage inflicting some of the most gruesome yet humorous gore-scenes of the 90's. The first 20 minutes are cluttered with the most awkward-sounding conversations you could imagine. Conversations that let you know that this isn't just a low-budget zombie flick this is a Z-grade disasterpiece fella. plenty Hysterical non-existent acting to go around and that goes triple for Mr. Mullet. That guy is truly the highlight of the night. The fact that Todd Sheets seriously considers Zombie Bloodbath to be THAT superior to Zombie Rampage amuses me to no end. I mean really both are complete jokes on celluloid but then again so is Redneck Zombies so obviously Todd Sheets is in the company of awsomeness. By 1993 a movie this bad would no doubt be a full-blast spoof but Mr. Sheets stands his ground giving us some good old fashion schlock the way it was meant to be unaware clueless and pointless. God bless Todd Sheets. For anyone seeking surprisingly worthwhile 90's B-Horror Leif Jonker's Darkness should be at the top of your list. As for Zombie Bloodbath if you're a gorehound who got bored sometime around 1990 then '93 would be the perfect time to pick up. 8/10 
 Well I guess it supposedly not a classic because there are only a few easily recognizable faces but I personally think it is... It's a very beautiful sweet movie Henry Winkler did a GREAT job with his character and it really impressed me. 
 What a brilliant film. I will admit it is very ambitious with the subject matter. At a little over two and a half hours it is a very long film too. But neither of these pointers are flaws in any way. Cry Freedom despite the minor flaws it may have is a powerful moving and compelling film about the story of the black activist Steve Biko in his struggles to awaken South Africa to the horrors of the apartheid. It is true that the first half is stronger than the second in terms of emotional impact. People have also complained that the film suffers from too much Woods not enough Biko. I may be wrong but although it is Biko's story it is told in the perspective of Woods so Woods is an important character in conveying Biko's story to the world. Cry Freedom visually looks amazing. With the show-stopping cinematography and the stunning South African scenery it was a visual feast. The opening scenes especially were brilliantly shot. George Fenton's music brought real dramatic weight to most scenes. It was subtle in scenes in the second half but stirring and dramatic in the crowd scenes. The script was of exceptional quality the courtroom scenes with Biko were enough to really make you think wow this is real quality stuff. The first half with Biko as the main focus constantly had something to feel emotional about whether it was the police's attack of the South African citizens or Biko's death. The second half entirely about Donald Woods carries less of an emotional punch but is compensated by how it is shot performed and written. And there are parts that are genuinely suspenseful as well. The performances were exceptional from the entire cast from the most minor character to the two leads there wasn't a single bad performance. Regardless of the accents that is but it is forgiven so easily by how much the performances draw you in. Denzel Washington in one of his more understated performances gives a truly compelling performance as Biko and Kevin Kline shows that he can be as good at drama as he is at comedy for he gave a suitably subtle performance to match that of Washington's. And the two men's chemistry is believable and never strikes a false note. Penelope Wilton is lovely as Donald's wife Wendy and she is a great actress anyway. Out the supporting performances and there may be some bias two stood out for me. One was Timothy West who relishes his role as Captain DeWet. The other was the ever exceptional John Thaw in a brilliantly chilling cameo-role as Kruger. Lord Richard Attenborough's direction is focused and constantly sensitive as usual. Overall a truly wonderful film. Ambitious and long it is but never ceases to be compelling powerful and achingly moving. A definite winner from Lord Richard Attenborough and worthy of a lot more praise. 10/10 Bethany Cox 
 First of all I've got to give it to the people that got this thing together. 9/11 is such a sensitive issue that making a movie that dares to be controversial about it takes a great deal of guts. It's a shame although not surprising that the movie was banned in the US. That being said I think that the movie is superb with a couple of weak moments. The movie starts up with the Iranian segment which turns out to be somewhat reminiscent of Majid Majidi's work (the absolutely beautiful heaven's children and the color of paradise ). Much like those 2 films the clip shows what happened through the innocent eyes of a class of Afgan refugees in Iran. Absolutely beautiful clip. Same goes for Sean Penn's clip which is superb as well. But just as some of the clips are beutiful others are absolutely brutal. Alejandro Gonz¨¢les I?¨¢rritu does the mexican clip and just like his gut-wrenching Amores perros he does it as brutal as he can. Most of the clip is a black screen with several sounds playing in the background. Those sounds are of the reporters and their shock as the second plane crashes those who called home from the burning towers and left messages for their families those who were angry....and he combines this with flashes of people jumping from the towers. A very hard clip to watch and one that you won't forget. Some clips could turn out to be very hard to watch for Americans as some of the clips could be interpreted as you're not the only ones that are suffering . In particular the Egyptian and British clips that not only say that but turn the tables and say how much suffering the US has caused to other people. I will also make a special mention to the clips from Bosnia-Herzegovina France India and Japan (although this last one may seem terribly out of place it actually isn't). However not all the clips are great and I make a special mention on the clip from Israel which in my opinion is extremely weak. While the idea was good (a reporter is at the scene of a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv but his story gets bumped because of what happened in New York is something that a lot of us who live in countries at war can relate to) the realization is terrible. The clip ends up as just some entertainment reporter trying to get some air-time at all costs a guy saying he's a witness and hoping that he can go on TV and soldiers and paramedics shouting just because . The clip fails to capture any of the drama of such a situation. If you happen to have the chance to see it then you should that is unless you're a conservative in which case you'd better stay out as you might get offended. But if you're not then you might learn how many of us outside the US lived through 9/11. 
 How anyone can say this is bad is beyond me. I loved this show before I even saw it. For 3 reasons 1. The Story intrigued me 2. Jessica Alba and 3. James Cameron! Please ignore the bad comments and Please watch the whole first Season before you decide that it's bad because I know that if you watch the first Season you will LOVE it and go out and Buy Season 1 as well as Season 2 on DVD and then Join the campaign to get Season 3 Made! I Hate Fox and I'm sure a lot of you Dark Angel fans hate them too. They have a thing for Canning Good Shows! Don't you all agree? 
 ...Heads Hands and Feet - a band from the past just like Strange Fruit. A triple whammy there. Those who have professed not to like this film are either heartless or under 40 and have had no experience of the real thing. Sad for them. This is an achingly well-observed little picture that is an excellent way of passing an hour or two and will probably not even fade much on the second showing. Stephen Rae Timothy Spall as the fat drummer (in many ways quite the most delightful figure of all) and Bill Nighy - a new name for me - as the neurotic vocalist and front man all turn in super performances and Juliet Aubrey has lovely doe eyes to go with some sharp acting as Karen who tries to hold the band together as they spectacularly self-destruct. The Syd Barrett/Brian Wilson echoes are loud and clear Mott the Hoople rear up before one in all their inflated ridiculousness and the script is never mawkish for more than a minute. Don't compare this with Spinal Tap or The Rutles or The Full Monty - it's unfair on all of them. The nearest comparison is The Commitments and that's no bad thing. And any film that can conjure up memories of Blodwyn Pig - a band I do not remember ever seeing but the name lives on - well it shows somebody in the team knew what they were on about. A small delight and thanks for the memory. Oh... and I've got ANOTHER one - Stiff Little Fingers; a-a-and what about SteelEYE Span... Spooky TOOTH... Ten Inch NAILS anyone? (You have to see the movie or have been on the road) 
 Intelligent wry and thrilling The Invisible Man stood out in 2000 among Sci-Fi's usual lineup balancing out Farscape 's fantastical art direction and sometimes melodramatic script with gritty cynical plots and modern noir dialogue. The show sat between Law and Order and Doctor Who on the believability meter but there was no denying the fact that I-Man 's characters went beyond caricature. Even characters that verged on predictability like the Keeper the Official and Eberts were given reprieves from the formulaic. Paul Ben-Victor and Vincent Ventresca had a chemistry that evolved and shifted elegantly made even more remarkable by the revolving door team of writers and directors. The effects are never allowed to overwhelm the plot and the science only sometimes verged on the totally unbelievable. The show's low points are still entertaining and I've never seen such taut pilot episodes. Matt Greenberg and Sci-Fi should be commended and fans have the right to demand a comprehensive DVD edition of the show. Every time I come across a marathon of Hercules: The Legendary Journeys on Sci-Fi I roll my eyes and sigh mourning the excitement and possibility of science fiction television that Invisible Man and its ilk represented. 
 Originally I rented this film for my daughter since she is keen on soccer - and I was not disappointed that way (except the plot interfered with the soccer scenes). As a dad I suppose I was a little surprised at the introduction of the topic of lesbianism - but I have to admit that as a parent these issues are completely available to children nowadays (as uncomfortable as I feel with the topic). In a way this emotion was a segue right into the main premise of the film - that at some age you must trust your children to make their own choices. This dilemma is introduced by a young British-born teen girl - Jasminder (Jess) - of east-Indian heritage who dreams of playing professional soccer. The pending marriage of her older sister in a traditional Hindu marriage provides many rich opportunities for her to explore (in a nice way) her hopes and fears for her future. The multi-cultural challenge was a very interesting technique to explore Jess's frustration with her parents expectations for her - again no different in substance than most child-parent relationships. In SUMMARY the soccer scenes are GREAT (lots to learn in slowmo) and while I didn't need the storyline - something was needed to keep the movie going. 
 In an alternate 1950s where an outbreak of the undead (caused by a mysterious 'space-dust') has been contained through the use of special electronic collars a young loner Timmy finds a friend in Fido (Billy Connelly) his family's recently acquired domesticated zombie. Fido quickly becomes a surrogate father to Timmy whose real dad is unable to adequately express his love for his son (or for his hot-to-trot wife played by the gorgeous Carrie-Anne Moss) having been psychologically scarred as a child (when he was forced to shoot his own father who tried to eat him!). Timmy runs into a spot of bother however when his putrid pal's collar goes on the blink and he attacks and kills an elderly neighbour. With the authorities on Fido's trail trouble brewing with a pair of local bullies and his mother forming a bond with their undead house-help will Timmy be able to hold on to his new found friend? A refreshing take on the whole zombie schtick Fido is a thoroughly entertaining deliciously dark comedy that should appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humour. Taking the Romero zombie-verse and transplanting it into 1950s small town America is a stroke of genius and the result is simply one of the most original films to tackle the whole 'reanimated dead' theme that I have seen. Connelly's Fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of inclusion in the Undead Movie Hall of Fame along with Day Of The Dead's Bub and Return Of The Living Dead's Tarman; it is not often I feel empathy for a walking corpse but The Big Yin's performance is so fine that I actually found myself rooting for the big blue bag of pus! The rest of the cast also give commendable performances with young K'Sun Ray (as Timmy) and Ms.Moss deserving special mentions?Ray because for one so young he puts in a particularly assured turn and Moss because she is so bloody yummy! This is the third zombie film that I have watched this week (the others being the somewhat disappointing Planet Terror and the rather fun Flight Of The Living Dead) and to my surprise it is also the best. Director Andrew Currie has given fans of the genre something truly original to treasure and is a talent to be watched in the future. 8.5 out of 10 rounded up to 9 for IMDb. 
 Using Buster Keaton in the twilight of his career was an interesting choice. He may have been the most talented comedian of the silent age. This gives him a chance to display those talents in a little time travel story. He get hooked up with a guy living in modern times and it becomes obvious that we are best left in our own times Keaton is able to do his sight gags very well. I've heard his voice before. I believe he did some of those Beach Party films playing some vacuous characters just to earn a few bucks. Serling seemed to have respect for him and portrayed him that way. It's not a bad story. It shows how one reacts when we wish for something we don't have and get that wish. 
 I have recently seen this production on DVD. It is the first time I have seen it since it was originally broadcast in 1983 and it was just as good as I remembered. At first as was worried it would seem old fashioned and I suppose it is a little dated and very wordy as the BBC serials were back then. (I miss those wonderful costume dramas that seemed to be always on Sunday afternoons back then) But that aside it is as near perfect as it could have been. I am a bit of a Jane Eyre purist as it is my favourite book and have never seen another production that is a faithful to the book as this one. I have recently re-read the book as well and some of the dialogue is just spot on. Reading the scene near the end where Rochester questions Jane about what St John was like I noticed their words were exactly reproduced on screen by Dalton and Clarke and done perfectly. All the other productions that have been done all seem lacking in some way some even leave out the Rivers family and their connection to Jane altogether. I also think this is the only production to include the Gypsy scene done correctly. The casting is perfect Zelah Clarke is like Jane is described in the book small plain and dark and I disagree that she looked too old. Timothy Dalton may be a little too handsome but he is absolutely perfect as Rochester portraying every aspect of his character just right and acting his socks off! I agree with other comment that he even appears quite scary at time like in the scene when he turns around slowly at the church when the wedding is interrupted his expression is fantastically frightening. But then in another favourite scene his joy is wonderful to see when Jane runs down the stairs and into his arms the morning after they declare their love for one another. A love that is wonderfully portrayed and totally believable. Oh to be loved by a man like that! There were a couple of scenes that were strangely missing however like when Jane climbs in to bed with the dying Helen and also when Rochester takes Jane shopping for her wedding things (I thought that one was in it but maybe my memory is playing tricks). Finally if you never see another production of Jane Eyre - you simply most see this one it is simply perfection! 
 Intelligent stylish and compelling thriller from the great Brian De Palma is a modern classic that firmly ranks among his best films! When troubled housewife is brutally murdered by a bizarre stranger the victim's son joins with a prostitute to uncover the killer. Dressed to Kill left a strong impression upon the audiences of its day and for good reason. De Palma creates a wonderfully dramatic story that begins with an intriguing setup and builds into a harrowing mystery full of strong suspense. The finale and conclusion are especially 'nightmarish'.It's a truly edge of your seat shocker. Even more impressive though is De Palma's elegant direction that gives this film not only tight suspense but a unique and dark atmosphere of its own. Dressed to Kill is also a very erotic film but mainly in a strangely beautiful way. Pino Donaggio also lends a lovely musical score to the film. The cast is another strong feature of this film. Michael Cain does a terrific turn as a psychiatrist. Angie Dickenson is wonderful as the ill-fated housewife. Nancy Allen's performance as an involved street-walker is solid. A young Keith Gordon also proves to be a worthy supporter as the investigating son. Many criticize De Palma's films for having Hitchcockian elements and this film was no exception. But any similarities between Hitchcocks works and De Palmas can only be seen as a good quality as calling this film a 'rip-off' would be degrading to a fine thriller. Dressed to Kill is a must see for all cinema fans. **** out of **** 
 I was very surprised with this film. I was touched with the lives that paulie touched along his way to find his marie the little girl he was separated from. The humor was also very good and it did not hurt the story as i thought it would probably do. Actually i was expecting paulie wants a cracker jokes to hurt this film but even that was done in a very humorous scene that turns very touching when paulie is in the research lab press room conference. So if you wish to see a good animal that talks film check this one out much better than Dr. DOLITTLE in my opinion. PAULIE also has a surprised twist in the end that is done very nicely as well. 
 I just have to say this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I cannot even count the number of times I've seen it. I was already in love with John Travolta but the first time the camera pans up his body after he's all clean-shaven looking beautiful for his first trip to Gilley's I was in awe. Debra Winger as always delivers a perfect performance as the young naive wife of Bud but with the necessary attitude to be married to a stubborn and hard-working cowboy. If you're not a country music person which I wasn't this is 1 soundtrack that'll have you singing right along with every word. If you get a chance please see this movie-it won't disappoint. 
 A brutally depressing script and some fine low-key performances by Peter Strauss and Pamela Reed and some good location shooting in Ohio power this fine TV movie about hard times in the rustbelt. As the mills close and the union jobs disappear the blue-collar workers are threatened by everyone: management owners their wives and children. Strauss is completely believable in his role and Pamela Reed is as always wonderful. See if you can recognize John Goodman before he put on weight. The heavy metal score -- was someone making a pun? -- is at times obtrusively annoying but the cinematography by Frank Stanley is knockout particularly the mill scenes. 
 As part of the celebration of the release of Casino Royale this film with the new Bond starring in it was shown from director Roger Michell (Notting Hill). I almost turned it off for being a bit boring but I'm glad I stuck with it. Basically May (Anne Reid) is a single mother of Helen (Anna Wilson-Jones) who hardly sees anyone and has not had a boyfriend in years. Her daughter says that she might want to get married to her new boyfriend Darren (Daniel Craig of course). After knowing each other only a few days May and Darren have a secret affair. And at her age with a 30-something and the new Bond?! Anyway they obviously want to keep it a secret but May has regrets and wonders if Helen will find out. When she does Darren gets less hassle than May. In fact Helen asks her permission to hit her. Also starring Peter Vaughan as Toots Danira Govich as Au Pair Harry Michell as Harry Rosie Michell as Rosie and Johnny English's Oliver Ford Davies as Bruce. Very good! 
 This movie brings back many memories of the classic cinema of old where actors didn't have to take their clothes off to make viewers watch their film. Firstly I think the main plus point of this movie is the amazing chemistry between Shahid and Amrita it is definitely the making of the film. I have seen lots of comments regarding the film being sickly sweet and overly slushy. In response to this I think to a certain degree this is a correct analysis however considering this is a Barjatya film I think that compared to MPK HAHK HSSH and MPKDH it has been toned down significantly. HSSH was almost unbearable to watch in some places. In this film however when the sentimental moments come along you find yourself smiling wishing the budding couple all the best and hoping that nothing bad happens to them. Another major plus point is the performances of Shahid and Amrita. Both have acted very well especially Shahid who looks great in the film. Amrita looks simply stunning and should be taken seriously as a future major star. Although I really enjoyed the film as a whole I do feel that it was too long. Some of the middle could have been trimmed off and it would maybe made even more of an impact. I also think the music although it fits into the film when you see the situations is slightly old fashioned and the movie could have benefited if a more up-to-date soundtrack had been available. Although the picturisation of the songs Mujhe Haq Hain and Hamari Shaadi Mein are wonderful. All in all I definitely recommend this film its romantic looks stunning and has a dramatic climax (I won't go into details just in case you haven't seen it. PS. If you're prone to crying-take a tissue! (I needed several) 
 Well let me just say something about these actors they really were a good decision and from experience having actors really brings the dialogue to life. If you walk into this even fifteen minutes late you'll be in for a shock the movie will have already began. You don't want to miss the first few jokes assuming you came to not miss any jokes. Wow! I have never seen a movie that ended with such a final ending. Not to be harsh I mean I loved it but it just surprised me that it really kept going until it stopped! But i'm getting ahead of myself lets start with the very start of it when it began. The plot outline goes like this there is this man and not to give away any spoilers (*Spoiler Alert!!*) (he hasn't had any sex ever(!) they use this plot device to set the story moving and there are (intentionally or not it could go either way) some funny situations had by the main characters some containing irony and jokes and awkward situations you know. The director uses the advancements in technology by combining the film shot on the set and scripted dialog some music and jokes to make a funny movie designed as a comedy where he takes us on a journey from the opening credits to the end with an entirely full movie in between. I went into this movie expecting to see a funny comedy because of what I already knew about it and left feeling as though i had just left a theater that just played a funny comedy. TEN STARS!!! 
 Sure for it's super imagery and awesome sound it's a great home theater show off disk but this is also a touching drama as well as an informative documentary. The parallel stories that are intertwined throughout this film will keep all viewers interested. Young old boys and girls alike will find that deep down we are all fans of the automobile especially the high performance indy machines that are the result of generations blood sweat tears ingenuity and perseverance. The Mark Knopfler and Ry Cooder sound track is perfectly matched to the visuals and the content. I don't want to give away the ending but the final driving sequence to Quincy Jones' Days Like These just might bring a tear to your eye. Enjoy it! 
 The final installment in the action thriller franchise is just that probably the hardest hitting of the three films. It goes further to play the anti-Bond theme. Bourne doesn't like what he is doing and wants to know about his blurry past. Everything about this film hits it on the nail from the cinematography to choreography/stunt work to the script to acting. The film starts out in a flurry as Bourne is running from the Moscow police. The story seems to pick up right where the first film left off. Or does it? The time is a little muddled here but we get the fact that Bourne is remembering things. A sudden flashback while trying to clean himself up nearly gets him caught but he makes it and doesn't kill anyone. They aren't his target. From there we get more of the intrigue of his past with a new player Noah Vosen who seems to know everything about Bourne and will protect it at all costs. Pamela Landy is back as well as Nicky Parsons who seems to have a past with Bourne as well. The cinematography is in your face following tight on practically everything. The car chase is even more intense if that seems possible than the ones from the first two. And the veteran cast chasing Bourne is superb with a nice part by Albert Finney. It also has slight political overtones in relationship to rendition and other government policies but that is minor and integrated very well within the plot. All in all this is the best of the trilogy conclusions this year if not the best action trilogy ever. 
 Given the title this first follow-up to QUARTET (1948) obviously reduces the number of W. Somerset Maugham stories which comprise the film. The author still turns up to introduce the episodes but there¡¯s no epilogue this time around; by the way while the script of the original compendium gave sole credit to R.C. Sheriff here Maugham himself also lent a hand in the adaptation as well as Noel Langley (though it¡¯s unclear whether they contributed one segment each or else worked in unison). As can be expected much of the crew of QUARTET has been retained for the second installment ¨C though this also extends to at least three cast members namely Naunton Wayne Wilfrid Hyde-White and Felix Aylmer (the last two had bit parts in the episode from QUARTET entitled ¡°The Colonel¡¯s Lady??). While TRIO ultimately emerges to be a lesser achievement than its predecessor (slightly unbalanced by the third story which takes up more than half the running-time) it¡¯s still done with the utmost care acted with verve by a stellar cast and is solidly enjoyable into the bargain. ¡°The Verger?? tells of a church sexton (James Hayter) ¨C for which the story¡¯s title is another word ¨C who¡¯s dismissed after 17 years of service by the new parish priest (Michael Hordern) simply because he¡¯s illiterate. Rather than rest on his laurels despite his age he not only takes a wife (his landlady played by Kathleen Harrison) but opens a tobacconist shop strategically placed in a lengthy stretch of road where no such service is offered ¨C and with business flourishing this is developed into a whole chain. The last scene then sees him pay a visit to bank manager Felix Aylmer who not only is surprised to learn of Hayter¡¯s lack of education but is prompted to ask him what his other interests were ¨C to which the wealthy (and respected) tobacconist replies with some measure of irony that he had the calling to be a verger! The second episode ¡°Mr. Know-All?? is the shortest but also perhaps the most engaging: a voyage at sea is utterly beleaguered by the insufferable presence of a pompous young man (Nigel Patrick) British despite his foreign-sounding name of Kelada who professes to be an authority on virtually every subject under the sun. Naunton Wayne and Wilfrid Hyde-White are the two passengers who have to put up with him the most ¨C the latter because he shares a cabin with the man and the former in view of Patrick¡¯s attentions to his pretty wife (Anne Crawford). During a fancy-dress party however the passengers decide to enact their ¡®revenge¡¯ on Kelada by having one of them impersonate him (a jest which he naturally doesn¡¯t appreciate)!; still it¡¯s here that he contrives to show a decent side to his character ¨C told by Crawford that the necklace she¡¯s wearing is an imitation Wayne challenges Patrick to name its price¡­but the latter realizes immediately that it¡¯s the genuine article and that this would compromise Crawford¡¯s position if he were to tell so Kelada allows himself to be publicly ridiculed rather than expose the fact that the woman probably has a secret admirer! As can also be deduced from the title ¡°Sanatorium?? deals with the myriad patients at such a place ¨C run by Andre' Morell; the protagonist is a new intern Roland Culver who wistfully observes the various goings-on. The narrative in fact highlights in particular three separate strands of plot ¨C one humorous (the ¡®feud¡¯ between two aged Scots long resident at the sanatorium played by Finlay Currie and John Laurie) one melodramatic (the erratic relationship between disgruntled patient Raymond Huntley and long-suffering but devoted wife Betty Ann Davies) and one bittersweet (the romance between na?ve but charming Jean Simmons and dashing cad Michael Rennie which in spite of having pretty much everything against it including the fact that Morell has diagnosed Simmons as a ¡®lifer¡¯ while Rennie only has a few years left to him leads the couple to the altar). 
 I was going to give it an 8 but since you people made 6.5 out of a lot better votes I had to up my contribution. The river Styx was pure genius. Sure Woody was his perennial stuff but at least his role was appropriate. The first half hour was really hilarious and then the rest of the movie was easy to watch. The dialog was clever enough and Woody's card tricks at the parties along with the reaction from the upper crust were fun to watch. This was much better than the newspaper critics made it sound out to be. And a plus a little Sorcerer's Apprentice to go along with it. And of course did you notice that Johansen is getting a bit frumpy? Charles Dance is always entertaining as was Hugh Jackman. 
 Care Bears Movie 2: A New Generation isn't at all a bad movie. In fact I like it very much. Yes I admit the dialogue is corny and the story is a bit poorly told at times. But Darkheart while very very dark is a convincing enough shape shifting villain and Hadley Kay did a superb job voicing him. Speaking of the voice acting it was great nothing wrong with it whatsoever. The animation is colourful and some of the visuals particularly at the beginning were breathtaking. The songs and score are lovely especially Growing Up and Forever Young the latter has always been my personal favourite of the two. The care bears who I do like are adorable and the human children are well done too. And the ending is a real tearjerker. All in all harmless kiddie fun. 8/10 Bethany Cox 
 the government that he fought to establish to recognize his loyalty with a promised and much needed pension. Ripstein's lyrical work is a sweet ode to all those who like the Colonel suffer under the abuses of a cynical and hardened society that strengthens itself by denying its citizens the means to live with dignity and purpose. Unlike the absurdity of WAITING FOR GODOT the Colonel's wait for the arrival of his pension gives hope and significance to his otherwise miserable life. Two things in the film drive the Colonel who is masterfully played by Fernando Lujan; the hope that his military pension will one day arrive and the knowledge that his son Agustin died for a noble cause a reason other than a drunken fracas at a rigged cockfight. Unable to realize the former and forced to prove to the world the latter the Colonel does the only thing he can do set about training his son's fighting cock. The cock is now the warrior who can bring fortune and justice to the Colonel and his asthmatic wife but his fighting ring is that of the killer of his former owner Agustin. In a tense scene of confrontation between the Colonel and Nogales his son's killer the Colonel is offered by Nogales a paid government agent money enough to equal the Colonel's full pension. But this is blood money; hush money designed to hide the fact that those in power have turned their backs on one who fought for their political ideals and to conceal to the world that the warrior colonel's son was assassinated because he wrote for an underground paper that favored the rights of labor unions and the common man. With maximum dignity the Colonel rejects Nogales' offer picks up his fighting rooster and walks away as nobly as his old legs can carry him. Once he is at home Dona Lola his scolding wife wants to know why the Colonel refused the money when both of them are starving. In response to her continued question What are we going to eat until November (when the cockfighting season begins) the Colonel responds Shit. Excrement is what the poor and disenfranchised have been eating all of their lives and excrement is a meal that the Colonel willingly chooses to eat with dignity knowing that he could never sell his soul to those who oppress him. The Colonel waits as the only man of honor and valor in a world without principles. 
 Enchanted April is a tone poem an impressionist painting a masterpiece of conveying a message with few words. It has been one of my 10 favorite films since it came out. I continue to wait albeit less patiently for the film to come out in DVD format. Apparently I am not alone. If parent company Amazon's listings are correct there are many people who want this title in DVD format. Many people want to go to Italy with this cast and this script. Many people want to keep a permanent copy of this film in their libraries. The cast is spectacular the cinematography and direction impeccable. The film is a definite keeper. Many have already asked. Please add our names to the list. 
 Godard once said a way to criticize a movie is to just make one and probably the strongest kind that could be made about Ralph Bakshi's take on Tolkien's magnum opus the Lord of the Rings has actually been made by Peter Jackson. The recent trilogy to me aren't even total masterpieces but they are given enough room with each book to breath in all the post-modern techniques crossed with classical storytelling to make them very good sweeping entertainments. But as one who has not read the books I end up now looking upon the two versions live-action (albeit partly animated in its big visual effects way) and animated (albeit partly done with actual live action as the framework) in relation to just the basic story not even complete faithfulness to the books. And with Bakshi's version it's almost not fair in a way as what we do see is really not the complete vision not what Jackson really had (probably final cut). Robbed of Return of the King's big climactic rush of the story and with the other two parts becoming rushed I ended up liking it more for what it did within its limitations though as such those same limitations make it disappointing. What's interesting too after seeing the Jackson films first- which I also slightly regret being that I might've reacted to this differently when I was younger and prior to five years ago- is that the basic elements of the story never get messed up with. Everything that is really needed to tell the Fellowship of the Ring story is actually pretty much intact and if anything what was probably even more gigantic and epic in Tolkien's book is given some clarity in this section. The actors playing the parts of the hobbits and the other heroes are more or less adequate for the parts with a few parts standing out (John Hurt as Aragorn and William Squire as Gandalf). The lack of extra characterization does end up making things seem a little face-value for those who've not even seen the other films or read the books and can't put them into context. But there is some level of interest always with the characters and here there's a more old-fashioned sensibility amid the large aura of it being more. This is not a garden variety Disney adaptation- warts and all this is a Bakshi film with his underground animation roots colliding with the mythical world of Middle Earth. And what Bakshi and his animation team bring to the film is one that ends up giving what is on screen in all its abbreviated form its hit or miss appeal. Along with being not totally complete as a film or as stories the form of the film is an experiment to see if something can be entirely rotoscoped. The results end up bringing what seems now to be retro but at the time of course was something that was a rough crazy inspiration on the part of the filmmakers. Might it have been better with more traditional drawn animation? In some parts yeah; it does become a little noticeable as was also the case in Bakshi's American Pop that the main characters move in such ways that are a little shaky like some kind of comic-book form done in a different way. Still there's much I admired in what was done. The orcs for example I found to be really amazing in they're surreal surroundings. They're maybe the best part of the combination of the animation on top of the live-action especially during parts where there isn't battle footage (that's really the real hit-or-miss section as there isn't continuity from the good and bad rotoscoping) and the chiaroscuro comes through with big shapes on top of horseback. It's creepy in a good way. And the backgrounds while also very rough and sometimes too sketchy are beautiful with the mixtures and blasts of colors together. It's almost something for art-film buffs as much as for the ring-nuts. So how would I recommend this animated take on the Lord of the Rings? I don't know to tell the truth. It's certainly a good notch above the other Tolkien animated film I've seen the Hobbit (and I've yet to see the animated ROTK) and there is some real artistry going on. There's also some stilted dialog an all-too-rushed Two Towers segment with the most intriguing character Gollum being reduced to maybe two scenes in all. And seeing something as fragmented like this ends up only reinforcing the completeness of the more recent films. If you're a fan of the books contemplating checking this out I would say it's worth a chance even if it's one of those chances where you watch for forty minutes and then decide whether to stop it or not. As for it fitting into Bakshi's other films I've seen it's an impressive ambitious and spotty achievement where as with Lynch's Dune it's bound to draw a dark mordor-like line in the sand between those who hate it passionately and those who don't. I don't. 
 I thought the movie was actually pretty good. I enjoyed the acting and it moved along well. The director seemed to really grasp the story he was trying to tell. I have to see the big budget one coming out today obviously they had a lot more money to throw at it but was very watchable. When you see a movie like this for a small budget you have to take that in to account when you are viewing it. There were some things that could of been better but most are budget related. The acting was pretty good the F/X and stunts were well done. A couple of standouts were the guy who played the camera asst. and the boy who played the child. These kind of films have kept LA working and this is one that turned out OK. 
 I read Holes in 5th grade so when I heard they were doing a movie I was ecstatic! Of course being my busy self I didn't get chance to see the movie in theaters. Holes was at the drive-in just out of town but alas We were just too busy. I was surprised to hear that all my friends had seen it and not one of them had invited me! They all said it was good but I've read great books that have made crappy movies so I was definately worried. Suddenly the perfect opportunity to see it came. It was out that week and my parents were going on a cruise and I was left to babysit. My sister who is 9 and I watched it and absolutely loved it! I then took it to the other people I was babysitting's house and their kids 9 and 4 liked it too. Even my parents loved it and they're deffinately movie critics. Overall I recommend this movie is for anyone who understands family morale and and loves a hilarious cast! This movie should be on your top 5 to See list!!!! 
 Excellent documentary ostensibly about the friendship and subsequent rivalry between two West Coast retro rock'n'roll bands: The Dandy Warhols and the Brian Jonestown Massacre. What it actually turns out to be is a portrait of a borderline psychopath - Anton Newcomb - and his tortured relationship with the rest of the world. Interestingly for a music documentary there is hardly any music. What there is - snatches of songs more often than not aborted by the performers - is incidental rather than central. Although the protagonists are musicians the story is not about music but rather about a particularly American version of a British myth of a cartoon lifestyle ie one where nobody has to take responsibility for behaving like spoiled adolescents on a full-time basis. Tantrums drugs violence grossly dysfunctional attitudes egomania on a truly epic scale - all of this is excused or positively encouraged because it conforms to some collectively held idea about what rock'n'roll is about. As a film this is a first-class documentary but it raises more questions than it answers. For example why is Anton's music so conservative? For someone so wild and outrageous (and he IS wild and outrageous) his music never seems to have progressed beyond the most obvious derivations of his 60s idols (The Stones Velvets etc.) For someone who claims to be able to play 80 instruments he has never bothered to learn to play any one of them beyond the most rudimentary level. Similarly the Dandy Warhols burning ambition is based on a vision of rock'n'roll which is astonishingly fossilised in 1969. Nothing wrong with pastiches of course but surely there's more to musical life than perpetually acting out a cartoon from the late 60s. Why don't they take some risks with their music - in the way that their role models did? Because one suspects this is not about music. Music is just an accessory a prop or an excuse to lead completely dysfunctional and irresponsible lives. But why? In the Dandy Warhols case the answer is obvious: to make lots of money and be famous. Big deal. Anton Newcomb's case is more interesting. He is obviously very talented but every time he is given an opportunity to reach a wider audience he sabotages it usually in the most dramatic way possible. He is terrified of success and at the same time deeply resents anyone else who has it - especially his former friends the Dandy Warhols. Fascinating movie. Highly recommended. 
 This great film is composed mostly of documentary footage is currently contained on a DVD along with Prelude to War. The great American filmmaker and story teller Frank Capra made these films which simply and clearly call attention to the main points that caused World War II and Hitler's rise. Every school child nay every American should watch these films today because they are so apropos. History has been repeating itself over and over again! The Lord Chamberlains are still alive and kicking; the tactics used by the Nazis of infiltrating countries through sympathizers and then the Communists and now by Muslim terrorist groups are still working to these evil group's advantage. By sitting back and letting Hitler as early as 1935 be aggressive - France America and England caused over 50 million people's deaths. Americans French and British today would happily let Hitler do exactly the same thing despite the fact that we should have learned from history what happens when you let dictators break treaties. These great films may be too simplistic for World War II history buffs. They don't tell the horrors that the Soviet Union caused simply because at the time America was teamed up with them fighting Hitler. This film does tell the plain facts and motives that led to the terrible war. 
 Hugh (Ed Harris) is a hotshot bachelor senator determined to run for president. One day however he happens upon an old high school classmate named Aggie. Aggie (Diane Keaton) is an accomplished and award-winning author with a lovely face and an independent spirit. Hugh is smitten. He convinces Aggie to become his fianc¨¦. But will Aggie have to sacrifice her principles of honesty in the world of politics where things are not always what they seem to be? And will she be able to withstand the rigors of a harsh media blitz? This is mostly a nice romance for those who adore tales of affection. Hugh and Aggie are absolutely in love and their banter and conversation are a good view. However although the movie tries to show the political life in its reality it doesn't completely succeed. Nevermind. The production values are high and the script is very elegantly written. With these advantages and the handsome personages of Keaton and Harris those who sit down to the film will find it to be good entertainment. 
 HOLLOW MAN is one of the better horror films of the past decade. The sub-plot is original and the main plot is even better. The special effects are brilliant and possibly the best I have ever seen in a horror film. Kevin Bacon proves again that he can handle any role that comes his way. Claude Rains shocked the world with THE INVISIBLE MAN in 1933 well now Kevin Bacon has shocked *us* with HOLLOW MAN. One of the most thrilling horror films ever. The action is intense and the chills are true. You may actually find yourself jumping if you are watching it in the dark on a stormy night. The supporting cast includes Elizabeth Shue Josh Brolin Kim Dickens Joey Slotnick Greg Grunberg and Mary Randle. All of whom do an exceptional job. ---SPOILERS--- Dr. Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) and his team have discovered the secret to making someone invisible. After animal testings they move on to human testing. But someone has to be the subject. Volenteering Caine is turned invisible. But when his team is unable to bring back into visibility Caine is driven mad by his condition as he seeks his revenge...*end spoilers* The film has created memorable shock sequences and is destined to become a classic well into the next century. Becoming the basis for a spoof joke in SCARY MOVIE 2 this film grabs you by the throat and never lets go. The first 45 minutes or so are slow developing the characters and showing how their experiments work. The second half is exciting and appealing to most action and horror fans. Think of DEEP BLUE SEA. Then change the sharks into an crazy invisible man. And then change the water into fire and explosions. A rehashing of a killer shark movie. Interesting... HOLLOW MAN gets 5/5. 
 I had first watched this several years ago on a now-defunct Sicilian TV channel; amazingly the film emerged as a heftily-priced DVD from Criterion: not being sure what I had made of it initially (despite having attained cult status over the years the achievement proper is clearly viewed with modesty even by genre buffs) I opted not to make the purchase ? as I did with the similar and to me unfamiliar FIEND WITHOUT A FACE (1958). Recently however I managed to acquire THE BLOB via a copy of the Spanish DVD which interestingly ported over the two Audio Commentary tracks from the Criterion Special Edition ?but regrettably I could not switch off the Spanish subtitles during playback of the main feature! Anyway looking at the film anew I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it (despite many a narrative flaw which I will get to later) ? as a pure example of 'B-movie' schlockiness (atypically shot in pleasant color) and a time-capsule illustrating late 1950s social attitudes. The male lead was an early role for Steve(n) McQueen and though the actor may have subsequently looked at it with disdain his sole contribution to the genre proves fairly engaging: not averse to juvenile kicks but still essentially a decent (and more importantly altruistic) kid. The special effects depicting the slimy and expanding creature are not too bad of its kind and period; the film itself rises to a good climax ? beginning with the monster's invasion of a cinema (showing DAUGHTER OF HORROR [1953/7] as I mentioned recently in that film's review but being curiously screened 'flipped' and which sequence incidentally would be featured at the opening of a satirical Italian program actually called Blob !). As to the admittedly minor quibbles I have with the film: the monster is not shown traveling ? it just turns up at a variety of places never being seen by anyone!; there is a baffling over-emphasis (tantamount to padding) on the kids' scrapes with Police; it is silly to have the town doctor shoot at The Blob ? as if fluid whatever its proportion can be destroyed by bullets!; equally nonsensical is having the teenagers alert the townsfolk of the danger by making door-to-door visits (especially when considering that at that stage only McQueen had actually seen the monster in action)! An inferior sequel emerged in 1972 called BEWARE THE BLOB!; the original was then remade in 1988 ? I watched this not too long ago but it seems not to have made a lasting impression on me (though I know Micheal Elliott loves it). For the record I will be following this viewing with two more collaborations between director Yeaworth and producer Jack H. Harris namely 4D MAN (1959) and DINOSAURUS! (1960). 
 They were always trying to get me killed Alec Guinness once wrote of The Man In the White Suit's technicians. They thought actors got in the way of things. He went on to describe how he'd been given a wire rope to climb down and assured it was safe narrowly avoided serious injury when it suddenly snapped mid-descent. People get in the way of things might be a maxim tailor-made for White Suit inventor Sidney Stratton (fittingly played blank slate-fashion by Alec Guinness) in Alexander Mackendrick's definitive Ealing film of 1951. Certainly he cares only about his work its realisation - and sod the consequences. And similarly with the exception of a couple of peripheral characters there's almost nobody to root for in this chilly satire on capital and labour. Told in flashback the film concerns Stratton's invention of a dirt-resistant everlasting fibre (fashioned into the white suit of the title) and subsequent attempts by the clothing industry and its unions to suppress it. While the industry fears the bottom will drop out of the market the shop floor stewards worry about finding themselves out of a job. Abduction and bribery attempts follow with both money and an industry chief's daughter on offer (Daphne the delectable 4-packs-a-day-voiced Joan Greenwood) to the tragi-comic end. What's to become of my bit of washing when there's no washing to do? bemoans Stratton's landlady near the close. A notion Stratton hadn't even considered - and has disregarded again by the movie's ambiguous coda. A superior if decidedly downbeat comedy expertly performed - and pretty much answering the oft-raised question of whatever happened to the everlasting light bulb and the car that ran on water... 
 This is the Neil Simon piece of work that got a lot of praises! The Odd Couple is a one of a kind gem that lingers within. You got Felix Ungar(Jack Lemmon); a hypochondriac fussy neat-freak and a big thorn in the side of his roommate Oscar Madison(Walter Matthau); a total slob. These men have great jobs though. Felix is a news writer and Oscar is a sports writer. Both of these men are divorced Felix's wife is nearby while Oscar's is on the other side of the U.S. (The West Coast). Well what can you say? Two men living in one roof together without driving each other crazy is impossible as well as improbable. It's a whole lot of laughs and a whole lot of fun. I liked the part where when those two British neighbors that speak to both gentlemen and after Oscar kicked out Felix he gets lucky and lives with them when he refused to have dinner with them the night earlier. It's about time that Felix needed to lighten up. I guess all neat-freaks neat to lighten up. They can be fussy yet they should be patient as well. A very fun movie and a nuevo classic. Neil Simon's The Odd Couple is a must see classic movie. 5 STARS! 
 Although Cameron Grant was clearly hired to replace Andrew Blake over at Ultimate Pictures when the latter started his own company (Studio A) he practically outdid the Master right out of the gate when it came to setting up steamy sex scenes. So while all the window dressing Blake had pioneered (starlets in fetish lingerie and sun glasses coiffed and made up as if they're about to hit the catwalk) remained very much present and accounted for Grant added his own personal spin to the carnal content. In doing so he raised the heat to a level that had eluded Big A ever since his first ? and IMHO best ? film NIGHT TRIPS. Cam's maiden effort ELEMENTS OF DESIRE might still have been handicapped by an overly slavish adherence to the Blake aesthetic (with a surfeit of girl on girl gropes) but his subsequent DINNER PARTY already shows him at the top of his form in what must surely rank as his masterpiece. The title spells out the premise as a group of well to do friends and acquaintances gather over dinner to swap sexy stories with an extended orgy at the conclusion. Scrumptious Juli Ashton and Tammy Parks smear food stuff all over each other's flawless physiques in their kitchen sequence that is sure to delight those with a taste towards combining pleasures of the palette with those of the flesh. Busty Crystal Gold (here : Catalina ) was rarely more than a reliable second-stringer adding spice to several Ona Zee bargain basement noirs yet looks absolutely stunning here in a romantic four poster frolic with Fabio lookalike Vince Voyeur. Beautiful blondes Kylie Ireland and Yvonne making out with Marc Davis (for the record the latter two were an item at the time) under a waterfall complete the eye candy section of the movie. Time to get cooking ! Early Jenna Jameson ( Daisy back then) foreshadows the greatness to come as she drains Frank Towers ( Mark Slade on his subsequent shift to the gay side of the industry) of all vital juices albeit with a little help from brunette Diva for effective contrast the scene's stylish industrial setting providing an atmospheric backdrop to the full tilt sex taking place. Impossibly hunky construction worker Gerry Pike seeks to cool off on a sweltering summer day by hosing down a prospect too tantalizing for prim 'n' proper business woman Asia Carrera (at her all time most achingly pretty) to pass up. Best of show must be the imaginative sequence that has nasty Norma Jeane and handsome Sean Michaels teasing the pants off each other ? for starters ! ? while separated by a glass partition right until the predictably splashy conclusion. With sex that proves either artsy or hot and more often than not both Grant has concocted a veritable sm?rg?sbord of fleshy wares to continue the film's gastronomic analogy the title implies. Couples may be the prime intended audience but an alternation between naughty 'n' nice should rightfully include that something for everything recipe so many adult features are aiming for. Acting as his own DoP the director shows great eye for detail like the shot of Asia Carrera's pristine white shoes being spattered with mud enriching his vision. This marks him out as a great filmmaker rather than a merely serviceable one as was the case with Nick Steele who stepped up to take his place at Ultimate ? effectively making him a replacement's replacement ? ? when he packed up for greener pastures. 
 This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the movie a lot of charm but in terms of a story.. well it's not really there. Or at least not very well worked out. The acting is also not so smooth by Caron. But I liked some of the dialogues I liked the scene at the Seine I liked the character played by Levant the colors; and the dancing of course which is quite magnificent. A 7.5 - 8 seems on the dot to me. 
 There have been several films about Zorro some even made in Europe e.g. Alain Delon. This role has also been played by outstanding actors such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins but to me the best of all times has always been Reed Hadley. This serial gives you the opportunity to see an interesting western where you will only discover the real villain Don del Oro at its end. The serial also has good performance of various actors of movies B like Ed Cobb ex- Tarzan Jim Pierce C. Montague Shaw eternal villains like John Merton and Charles King and a very good performance of Hadley as Zorro. He was quick smart used well his whip and sword and his voice was the best for any Zorro. 
 Presenting Lily Mars is one of a genre of film that sadly seems to have disappeared with the studio system. Ok now that you know my bias here are some reasons I think this movie does stand out. 1. Although the basic plot - Lily Mars (Judy Garland) goes to New York becomes a star and wins the heart of her director (Van Heflin) is a pretty stock Hollywood story of the period the writers do vary the theme her a bit more than usual. Although Lily gets her big break when the star quits she isn't successful and has to swallow her pride and go back to playing a minor role in the show. 2. Judy Garland (enough said!) 3. The supporting cast includes some really great performances. Spring Byington as Lily's mother is truely wonderful as is Fay Bainter (the mother of the director - John Thornway (Van Heflin)). The standout supporting performance though goes to character actress Connie Gilchrist as Frankie a one time actress turned theater custodian. Worth a watch for sure. One of those movies that are designed to make you feel better about the world and your dreams. 
 I loved this film seen this evening on a movie theatre big screen! The audience laughed out loud at some very interesting things and the fast pace was most enjoyable. I do as a singer and musical director question one section of Roby Keeler's vocal in By a Waterfall. The key modulated and she was suddenly singing much lower in a very mellow voice that bore no resemblance to the somewhat tin-like higher twitter voice she used in all her other vocals. Does anyone know if this was overdubbed by another singer? It sounds it to me. I would love to know. Thanks so much. 
 This movie is one of the most Underrated movie of its time. When watching this movie your filled with action and when somethings not really happing the humour is un matched. Brilliant writing for a movie that was made to give us a bloody mix of a game show where criminals are the contestants and a near future where the general public all have a thirst for blood.Also Arnold Doesn't let us down with some of his best one liners.I don't want to spoil anything for you but i will tell you when Arnold gives his I'll be back line He gets the best response of them all in this movie. Hope you enjoy this gem as much as i did. 
 Citizen X tells the story of Andrei Chikatilo The Ripper of Rostov who killed 52 people in 8 years time mainly women and children. It shows how the investigation was obstructed by Soviet bureaucracy how hard it was to investigate the crimes. It does the job in such a brilliant way that it will leave no-one untouched. In the beginning it's perhaps a little bit slow of pace but it really grabs you as the story unfolds. I can only say that next to The Silence of the Lambs this is by far the best movie about a serial killer I've ever seen. It is very hard to say which actor's performance stands out above the rest in this movie. Stephen Rea is really brilliant as the inexperienced forensic expert who is put in charge of the investigation. Donald Sutherland's performance as his cynical superior and the only person in the Russian government willing to help him is as outstanding as Rea's. And what to say about Jeffrey DuMann playing the serial killer? DuMann brilliantly created a character who inspires empathy rather than hatred. Yes he is a monster but he is also a sad figure oppressed and ridiculed by his wife his boss his co-workers... He is tortured ashamed as well as extremely vicious. I can only recommend this movie to everybody who's interested in a well-made docu-drama where the actors are still more important than the special effects. It deserves at least a 9/10 perhaps even more if you ask me. 
 huge Ramones fan. i do like the ramones and i suppose if you hate them then besides being a avid Bush supporter you might not like this classic. it's immensely better than the sappy john hughes teen films and the like that littered the 80's. infinitely better than the American Pie's that plague us now. There are some other great high school films: Switchblade Sisters Fast Times... Class of '84 Three O'Clock High and the cheesy yet gripping(doesn't seem possible) River's Edge. But RnRHS will always be my favorite because it's the funniest and most fun plus you can get up and dance with it. I love you Riff Randell. 10/10 
 'Moonstruck' is a love story. There is not one romance there are at least three but they all have to do with the same family. Loretta's family. Loretta (Cher) is about to marry Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello). She doesn't love him but he is sweet and good man. When he leaves to visit his dying mother in Italy Loretta meets Johnny's brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage). He and Johnny haven't spoken each other in five years and Loretta wants to invite him to the wedding. Of course they fall instantly for each other. How this story and love stories of Loretta's parents and uncle and aunt develop is something you simply have to see for yourself. Every seen is a delight to watch with Cher as the bright star in the middle of everything. She won and really deserved the Oscar that year. Cage is pretty good and goofy as well and Olympia Dukakis as Loretta's mother and Vincent Gardenia as her father are terrific. This movie is funny charming and therefore highly enjoyable. 
 Some of the posters seem less than gruntled because this is neither Mark Twain nor Rodgers and Hart but clearly it doesn't pretend to be either. You'll look a long time to find a greater Rodgers and Hart fan than me but Burke and Van Heusen weren't exactly chopped liver in addition to which they knew Der Bingle inside out and tailored some great songs - But Beautiful Moonlight Becomes You It's Always You The Day After Forever etc - to fit his highly personal style and here they come up with yet another fine - and unfairly neglected - ballad Once And For Always plus a couple of upbeat philosophy-lite entries in If You Stub Your Toe On The Moon and Busy Doing Nothing. The flimsy plot isn't meant to be taken seriously - why else make Merlin a heavy when in most if not all of the other versions he is more a friend/mentor to Arthur - so if you start wondering aloud why Sir Lancelot who has been sold to historians as the epitome of chivalry and uprightness metamorphoses into a schoolyard bully you're not going to get much fun out of what is essentially a fun movie. On balance it does what it sets out to do entertain so good luck to it. 
 Frustrating to watch because of one man's stubbornness to leave his native country for the dream land in Switzerland and what he does to achieve that creates heartache for all those involved. Along the journey he encounters scumbags who take advantage of other human suffering and desperation. 
 One of the great things about many of the superb Chinese movies you can find if you are lucky in the video stores is they are very accurate retellings of actual true stories. Farewell my Concubine The Emperor and the Assassin and this movie are perfect examples. The film makers take a true story and work hard to accurately create a movie without compromising the facts for dramatic or commercial convenience -- the hallmark of much Hollywood and especially Disney films. In this story we follow the later years of an famous local street performer dubbed the King of Masks for his mastery of Sichuan Change Art. Along an having lost his only son many years earlier he searches to find a male heir to carry on his rare and dying art in a society that forbids females to have such work. Master Wang is sold a son by a slave trader. All is well as he joyfully prepares to pass down his art. But the son eventually is found out to be a girl. From there the story get very interesting with a good performance by Master Liang of the Sichuan Opera -- a regional operatic style related to Peking Opera. Fans of Farewell My Concubine should look carefully at Master Liang's portrayal of a male playing the female role in Chinese Opera. It may help them come to understand that the players of these female roles were probably not homosexuals or castrati but people who have be so psychologically conditioned as to be totally unaware of their own sexuality. 
 This has to be hands down hats off one of the most uproarious comedies ever made. Starting with the animated blowing popping bubbles the entrance to the Daytime Awards the usual phony drivel spewed by the stars on the red carpet the rehearsed and badly acted acceptance speech the venomous comments uttered by the actor's jealous co-stars and producer under phony smiles. Now THAT is only in the first few minutes. Then all hell breaks loose from there and it only gets more frantic and ridiculous. Ridiculous in a good way no make that a great way. This was the first time I'd seen the always charming Teri Hatcher. While I may not be a follower of Desperate Housewives she herself is always watchable - same goes for Lois & Clark. Not a huge follower but if I run across an episode I'd watch it. Robert Downey jr. does a great turn as slimy smarmy snaky sycophantic David Seaton Barnes the producer who'd give his right eye to see Sally Field's Celeste Talbert leave the show if only to finally get to get it on with Cathy Moriarty's Montana Moorehead. Moriarty absolutely shines in this movie just as she had everywhere else she's appeared. Here all she has to do is scream I HATE YOU I HATE YOU YOU CREEP! or give one of her anti-Celeste-co-conspirators an evil grin and she has me rolling in the aisles. Yes Cathy Moriarty is a very gifted actress and one hell of a comedienne. Sally Field gratefully departs from the usual 70-MM-sized Lifetime Tragedy of the Week movies and we're all reminded why she is who she is today having started off in comedy afraid of nothing. Her ensuing years of drama had hidden her sense of humor but like a caterpillar in a cocoon the brilliant comedienne she is had blossomed and it was joyous to see her as hilarious as she was. The thing with dramatic actors and actresses is that you see in such heavy serious roles that you associate them with their character and you can't believe it when you see them finally having some fun on screen. How lucky were the producers to land Carrie Fisher if only for a glorified cameo. She doesn't realize what a presence she bears on screen. She takes a role which in the hands of a lesser actress could easily have been forgotten but she owns the character and it seems as if she wrote it herself. How lucky was Elisabeth Shue to get thrown in the middle of all this! At the time she wasn't really known for much. Adventures in Babysitting was kind of cute (yes I was dragged to an evening show for which I had to pay full price) but she didn't hold my attention - - much. But here she makes the most of her character - star's niece who falls in love with the star's ex-co-star-and-lover who of course turns out to be the niece's father and the star turns out to be the poor girl's mother. I'll stop there - I feel I practically wrote a book about this brilliant screwball comedy or at least a novela. If you've seen it then reminisce. If you haven't you've missed a real classic but not really. The DVD's are made of a material that'll last for at least 25 years and this movie is timeless so what the hell. 
 Watching film i was in very light mood and also this film is light but the end of the film is just unexpected which leaves a long lasting memories in one's mind. movie starts with Abhay and his profession of being witness during registrar marriage. Soha comes for marriage and his boyfriend doesn't leaving Soha alone on to the street she cant go back home and she don't have any thing to live on here in this situation Abahy turns out to be a helper for her this is the base of story. The rest is just watchable and the end of the story is bitter sweet that Abhay has to face which keeps you at the edge of the seat. Dialogues and music are good songs are OK direction is good and so as the screenplay you do feel that movie is slow but looking to the demand of story it is all right. A truly watchable especially with light mood i enjoyed this at home with coke and peanuts. my rating for this is 8/10 
 This isn't the best Bigfoot ever made but by the recent standards of Nature gone awry movies mostly showing on the Sci-Fi channel this is quality stuff. It has some action some humor decent F/X and Bigfoot. CG is used but so are some practical F/X which I like. Overall this movie is worth a watch if you are a fan of B horror/sci-fi and need a fix. It's better than the movie Sasquatch and not a sequel to it so don't be fooled. The acting is better than you may expect to find in a movie like this and the directing is more than adequate. Expect a bit of a lul as the characters are developed but know that things will pick up. If you are watching a DVD you may want to skip a chapter or two. 
 Panic is a captivating blurred-genre film about a brooding and conflicted middle aged hitman's reconciliation of infatuation with a younger uninhibited hairstylist his love of wife and son his duty to his employer/father with his own identity. Although the film has a nebulous purpose and an ambiguous ending it is a superb production in almost all aspects. The characters' clarity and sincerity in such an improbable story may both fascinate and annoy audiences. 
 This movie has no story. It's only about a bunch of guys who tortures an innocent young girl to death. !!!SPOILERS!!! This is what they do: They beat her put her in a net and let her hang inside like birdfood spin her around on a chair until she pukes expose her to loud noise pour boiling oil on her put worms in her sores crush her hand with a sledge-hammer and finally pokes a needle through her eye. This movie was so realistic that if I didn't know it was fake I would have thought it was a snuff-movie. Although I was disgusted by this movie i really liked it. It scared me. I guess it fills some kind of purpose. I give it a 10/10. 
 I drove from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to see this movie premiere--and really glad I did. As a big movie fan and a life-long Northern Californian I was surprised how many Oscar-winning films have been made in the Bay Area. As a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the Bay Area as opposed to going to LA George Lucas' comments about persistence community and having a vision really resonated with me. Hey if he and all the other filmmakers can make it in SF so can other artists. Would recommend this film 
 Moe and Larry are newly henpecked husbands having married Shemp's demanding sisters. At his music studio Shemp learns he will inherit a fortune if he marries someone himself! Husbands Beware is a remake of 1947's Brideless Groom widely considered by many to be one of the best Stooge films with Shemp. The remake contains most of the footage from that film. The new scenes shot May 17 1955 include the storyline of Moe and Larry marrying Shemp's sisters along with their cooking of a turkey laced with turpentine! A few new scenes are tacked onto the end of the film as well(a double for Dee Green was used; if you blink you will miss the double's appearance.) Husbands Beware would have made for a good film with just the plot line of marrying the sisters. Budget considerations coupled with fewer bookings for two-reel comedies influenced the decision to use older footage. Although completely new films were still being made by the Stooges most of their releases by 1955-56 were made up of older films with a few new scenes tossed in. Husbands Beware while one of these hybrids is watchable and entertaining; we get to see most of Brideless Groom again and the new scenes are funny enough to get the viewer through the film. This film is one of the last Stooge comedies to feature new footage of Shemp and it was released six weeks after his death. 7 out of 10. 
 Although the plot was a bit sappy at times and VERY rushed at the end as if the director had run out of his alloted time and needed to hurry up and finish the story overall it was pretty good for the Made-For-Backwoods-Cable-TV genre. However the actress who played the babysitter Mariana Klaveno was very good! I hope to see more of her around in movie-land. The music was also well done getting every possible chill out of the dah-DUH-dah-DUH (think JAWS ) type music-based tension build-ups. I don't think I'd want to watch While the Children Sleep again but if I did it would be to focus on the performance of the talented Klaveno. 
 Midnight Cowboy made a big fuss when it was released in 1969 drawing an X rating. By today's standards it would be hard pressed to pull an R rating. Jon Voight who has been better is competent in his role as Joe Buck an out of town hick wanting to make it big with the ladies in New York City. He meets a seedy street hustler named Ratso Rizzo who tries to befriend Buck for his own purposes. The two eventually forge a bond that is both touching and pathetic. As Ratso Dustin Hoffman simply shines. Hoffman has often been brilliant but never more so than in this portrayal. He is so into character that all else around him pales in comparison. Losing the Academy Award to John Wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Director Schlessinger has a deft hand with his production but this film has a grungy underbelly that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer. Worth seeing for Hoffman's performance alone. 
 In the movie several references are made in subtly to Blade runner but one of the most obvious is the fact the Cain 607 and his unit are all genetic constructs breed to be expendable warriors. But as favorite quote of mine from the movie is you should have made them smart as well as fast . Kurt Russell did a incredible job his facial expressions or lack of in the movies gave more in the way of relating the story then the rest of the cast combined. Even when he falls in love with Sandra but does not know how to deal with these emotions and his tears after being expelled from the group or his shuddering when he is given a hug and his attachment to the mute young boy who in many ways reminded Todd of himself and what he could have been if not for his selection to be a soldier. 
 Okay - I'll confess. This is the movie that made me love what Michael Keaton could do. He does a beautiful parody of someone doing a parody of James Cagney with charm to spare. The supporting cast are solid workers all and will step right up and do a fine job in this '80s comedy. A spoof of the '30s-'40s gangster movies it breaks new ground constantly with remarkably original material. (Well yeah - some of it has been copied since - but when this movie was made it was original and much of it has _not_ been copied elsewhere.) Watch Joe Piscopo warn people to not do ______ with one of the great taglines of spoofs. Watch Roman Moronie do things with English profanity that would make your spinster grammar teacher laugh. Watch amazing sight gags such as pet-store owner Johnny Kelly using the price-tag gun on his puppies and dusting his kittens. Watch the greatest warning against sex educational film ever made. Watch the most amazing misrepresentation of church Latin done while a guy who never took shop class assembles a Thompson machine gun from parts. Watch lines you'll be using in casual conversation for the next decade. Watch Maureen Stapleton do the perfect antithesis to the hard-working mom with surprise gags that you'll never see coming. If you see a gag that doesn't hit your funny bone be patient - another will come along in 30 seconds or less and the odds are you'll need to pause until you're done rolling on the floor several times. Duckies and Bunnies? Them too. Watch for the subtle stuff - some of the sight gags can go by unnoticed the first few viewings. There are a few minor flaws - but it's probably the best of the spoofs. Some come close but none of them are quite this good. 
 It has taken me a while to watch this version as unfortunately I don't seem to be able to rent it in the video store only the other version but I fell in love with it. I was always borderline with the other Emma. Gwenneth and Toni Collette as they are not British naturally have to put on the accent and well to me it doesn't seem natural. It seems put on. Sorry but don't think Toni and Gwenneth did a brilliant job there. I could not warm to any of the characters but this version is more heart warming and more the type of person I imagined Emma to be. It is definitely the version I will come back to from now on. I was disappointed that Mr Knightley was not better looking but he is convincing. I also like Jane Fairfax better (played by Olivia Williams). I never warmed to her in the movie version but she is better portrayed in this version. Come to think of it (besides Mr Knightley) all characters are better played and a lot less over the top. Unfortunately both came out around same time and the Paltrow version got more publicity. Pity...... I also love the new scene at the end. Well done to Kate Beckingsale! Therefore if you are a Jane Austen fan don't forget to watch this one. 
 Halloween is one of those movies that gets you skin deep! It is in my opinion the scariest movie of all time. Michael Myers is the best boogeyman ever! He was just so terrifying! What makes Halloween so special is that there was no special effects where you can tell how computer animated it is this was on a low budget and had a one note score yet managed to scare the Hell out of people. 25 years and this movie still has the same effect as it did in '78. It's about a boy Michael Myers he kills his sister at the age of 6 and so many years later escapes the mental institution. Dr. Sam Loomis is after him and will do anything to get him back since he describes Michael as ...pure evil. The blackest eyes the Devil's eyes . Michael is on a mission though to kill his other sister Laurie played by a new Jamie Lee Curtis. She has to babysit on Halloween while her friends are out partying and of course we know the rules they get it! But Laurie may stand a chance since she's the virgin. ;D Halloween pays many homages to Psycho we have another character named Sam Loomis and Jamie Lee Curis the daughter of Janet Leigh. Halloween is an absolute terrific movie that breaks boundaries and makes you lock the doors bolt your windows and turn off the lights! They're gonna get you! They're gonna get you! . Halloween the ultimate horror film! 10/10 
 Parsifal (1982) Starring Michael Kutter Armin Jordan Robert Lloyd Martin Sperr Edith Clever Aage Haugland and the voices of Reiner Goldberg Yvonne Minton Wolfgang Schone Director Hans-Jurgen Syberberg. Straight out of the German school of film the kind that favored tons of symbolism and Ingmar Bergmanesque surrealism came this 1982 film of Wagner's final masterpiece- Parsifal written to correspond with Good Friday/Easter and the consecration of the Bayreuth Opera House. This film follows the musical score and plot accurately but the manner in which it was filmed and performed is bold and avant-garde and no other Parsifal takes the crown in its bizarre cinematography. Syberberg is known for controversial films. Prior to this film he had released films about Hitler and Nazism Richard Wagner and his personal Anti-Semitism and a documentary about Winifred Wagner one of his grand-daughters. This film is possibly disturbing in many aspects. Parsifal (sung by Reiner Goldberg but acted by Michael Kutter) is a male throughout the first part of the film and then after the enchantment of Kundry's kiss is transformed into a female. This gender-bending element displays the feminine/masculine/ying-yang nature of the quest for the Holy Grail which serves all mankind and redeems it through Christ's blood. In the pagan sorcerer Klingsor's fortress there are photographs of such notoriously sinister figures as Hitler Nietzche Cosima Wagner and Wagner's mistress Matilde Wesendock. The Swaztika flag hangs outside the fortress. Parsifal journeys into the 19th and 20th century throughout the film. The tempting Flower Maidens are in the nude. Kundry is portrayed as a sort of beautiful but corrupt Mary Magdalene or Eve from Genesis (played by Edith Clever but beautifully sung by mezzo-soprano Yvonne Minton). Ultimately this film is for fans of this type of bizarre Germanic/European symbolic metafiction and for intellectuals who appreciate the symbolism the history and lovers of Wagner opera. Indeed the singing is grand and compelling. Reiner Goldberg's Parsifal is a focused and intense voice but it lacks the depth and overall greatness of the greater Parsifals of the stage - James King Wolfgang Windgassen Rene Kollo and today's own Placido Domingo. Yvone Minton is a sensual-voiced dramatic and exciting Kundry delving into her tormented state perfectly. While the production is certainly unorthodox and as un-Wagnerian as it can possibly get (Wagner's concept was Christian ceremonial pomp with Grails spears castles Knights and wounded kings a dark sorcerer darkness turning into light etc typical Wagnerian themes)..it is still an enjoyable art-house film. 
 My personal feeling is that you cannot divorce this movie from its political/historical underpinnings like so many (American) reviewers tend to do. This is not about growing up on Main Street USA. It is about growing up in Yugoslavia at a time when it was torn between the East and the West. Just like the guys are torn between Esther and everybody else and Esther is torn between the Tovarish Joe and the guys. There is shame in certain situations that is lost on an audience that has never lived under Tito. I feel the movie is under-rated and it is too bad we have lost the director. Movies like this make freedom feel more important. It is not just another Eastern European coming of age film ...it is a sensitive portrayal of teenagers walking a fine line that might eventually lead them to real freedom. 
 This 1981 comedy still sparkles thanks to the combined efforts of writer/director Steve Gordon and stars Dudley Moore and John Gielgud. Sadly Gordon only in his early forties died soon after completing this his only feature film. It's an especially unfortunate loss since he shows a truly deft hand at character-driven farce that makes the whole film irresistible. It plays almost like a 1930's-style screwball comedy revamped for contemporary tastes. The plot centers on Arthur Bach a drunken diminutive millionaire playboy who is at risk of losing his $750 million inheritance if he doesn't marry the dowdy and boring Susan Johnson an heiress handpicked by his old-money father and dotty grandmother. Of course he doesn't love her and by chance runs into Linda Marolla a working-class waitress (and of course aspiring actress) after she pilfers a Bergdorf Goodman tie for her father. The standard complications ensue but in a most endearing way with loads of alcohol-fueled slapstick executed with classic ¨¦lan by Moore. That he makes such a spoiled character likable is a credit not only to his comic talents but to Gielgud's feisty acidic turn as Hobson Arthur's devoted but reality-grounded valet. It's the type of role he could play in his sleep but Gielgud makes Hobson such a truly memorable character that his fate in the film brings a welcome injection of poignancy in the proceedings. In probably her most likable film role Liza Minnelli hands the picture to her male co-stars by toning down her usual razzle-dazzle personality and making Linda quite genuine in motivation. A pre- LA Law Jill Eikenberry plays Susan just at the right passive-aggressive note while Barney Martin (Jerry's dad on Seinfeld ) steals all his scenes as Linda's slovenly father Ralph. The one fly in the ointment is veteran actress Geraldine Fitzgerald who overdoes the eccentricities of the grandmother. And I have to admit that I still can't stand the very dated overplayed Christopher Cross song that inevitably won the Oscar for that year's best song. Unfortunately the 1997 DVD certainly in need of remastering has no extras worth noting except some photos and production notes. 
 This episode is certainly different than all the other Columbos though some of the details are still there the setup is completely different. That makes this Columbo unique and interesting to watch even though at times you might wish for the old Columbo. I liked it a lot but then I like almost any Columbo. 
 I saw Jack Frost for ¡ê4:00 at my local store and I thought it looks pretty good for a low budget movie so I bought it and I was right it was good. For starters this film is about a killer snowman so that's something to laugh about and the way it looks was funny compared to the Snowman on the cover. The acting was okay and the lines Jack Frost said had me laughing I only axed you for a smoke and Worlds most pi**ed off snow cone how funny and camp is that? The tale at the start was pretty funny and silly too Jack be nimble Jack be quick Jack gouged eyes with candle sticks . If you're looking for a for a B-Movie Comedy horror that's full of puns then check Jack Frost out. 10/10 
 After reading several comments I felt I had to add in my two cents as well. Sorrow Lost is one of the most memorable shorts I think I have ever seen. I had gotten the chance to see this at the New York Independent Film Festival. I felt that this movie was incredibly beautiful and emotional. The story was beautifully complex - especially for such a short amount of time. The story is focused on a young girl who is victimized by her abusive father. She is soon given the choice to stop him by a demon played by Witchblade's Eric Etebari. Having watched the show I was amazingly impressed with how he played such unique and different character. I never knew he could act so well! His character was deeply complex and he was very persuasive. The acting was absolutely superb by him. The girl's was okay and the father's was decent. There is also death in this who follows the girl around until she is able to escape from her future. The effects and cinematography were absolutely mind blowing. I wonder if they had at least a hundred thousand budget for this. It is rare you get to see such a high quality short. The opening was absolutely breathtaking comparable with any major feature film. This isn't to say that it's not without its flaws - I thought it took a little to get going and the intro was a little long. But this stuck in my head days after watching it. There are very few shorts with this level of quality. 
 Dahl seems to have been under the influence of Wenders' The American Friend. Innocent Nick Cage gets recruited for a hit. Dennis Hopper plays a real Hit Man. Lara Flynn Boyle is dangerous. The Hero gets more entangled the more he tries to extricate hisself. And small town America does not seem all that safer than the Big City. Like it's predecessor mentioned above this movie has lots of plot twists and turns that seem improbable but all lead to the cathartic self discovery. 
 That was the first thing that sprang to mind as I watched the closing credits to Europa make there was across the screen never in my entire life have I seen a film of such technical genius the visuals of Europa are so impressive that any film I watch in it's wake will only pale in comparison forget your Michael Bay Ridley Scott slick Hollywood cinematography Europa has more ethereal beauty than anything those two could conjure up in a million years. Now I'd be the first to hail Lars von Trier a genius just off the back of his films Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark but this is stupid the fact that Europa has gone un-noticed by film experts for so long is a crime against cinema whilst overrated rubbish like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Life is Beautiful clean up at the academy awards (but what do the know) Europa has been hidden away absent form video stores and (until recently) any British TV channels. The visuals in Europa are not MTV gloss; it's not a case of style over substance its more a case of substance dictating style. Much like his first film The Element of Crime von Trier uses the perspective of the main character to draw us into his world and much like Element the film begins with the main character (or in the case of Europa we the audience) being hypnotized. As we move down the tracks the voice of the Narrator (Max von Sydow) counts us down into a deep sleep until we awake in Europa. This allows von Trier and his three cinematographers to pay with the conventions of time and imagery there are many scenes in Europa when a character in the background who is in black and white will interact with a person in the foreground who will be colour von Trier is trying to show us how much precedence the coloured item or person has over the plot for instance it's no surprise that the first shot of Leopold Kessler (Jean-marc Barr) is in colour since he is the only character who's actions have superiority over the film. The performances are good they may not be on par with performances in later von Trier films but that's just because the images are sometimes so distracting that you don't really pick up on them the first time round. But I would like to point out the fantastic performance of Jean-Marc Barr in the lead role whose blind idealism is slowly warn down by the two opposing sides until he erupts in the films final act. Again muck like The Element of Crime the film ends with our hero unable to wake up from his nightmare state left in this terrible place with only the continuing narration of von Sydow to seal his fate. Europa is a tremendous film and I cant help thinking what a shame that von Trier has abandoned this way of filming since he was clearly one of the most talented visual directors working at that time Europa much like the rest of his cinematic cannon is filled with a wealth of iconic scenes. His dedication to composition and mise-en-scene is unrivalled not to mention his use of sound and production design. But since his no-frills melodramas turned out to be Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark then who can argue but it does seems like a waste of an imaginative talent. 10/10 
 I'm 14 so you probably would think I have never heard of George Burns or Walter Matthau or anyone like that. Boy are you wrong. I had heard that George Burns was in this movie and that he won an Academy Award for it. I have been a fan of George Burns since I was ten. I saw the movie Oh God recently and loved it. This one was also very awesome. George Burns did a great job. So did Walter Matthau(this is the first time I've ever seen him perform). And even though they had really small roles Phyllis Diller and Steve Allen did a good job. That special they were filming would have been awesome if it was really done. Let me say this if you are a fan of George Burns or Walter Matthau you should see this movie right away! 
 a movie about the cruelty of this world. I found it liberating as only truth can be. It also contains some quite funny bits. Some of the acting is extraordinary see Maria Hofst?tter for instance. The director has tried to depict life as realistically as possible succeeding. Coherently the sex scenes are explicit and no more fake than those of a hard-core movie. Although I hardly understood a sentence I found the vision of the movie in the original language with subtitles much more rewarding because with the dubbing half the great work of the actors gets lost. The voice of the character played by Maria Hofst?tter is particularly hard to duplicate by a dubber. My favorite movie 
 Nice character development in a pretty cool milieu. Being a male I'm probably not qualified to totally understand it but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive Victorian environment from the start. It isn't as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher. What makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters. Each has their own thing that they contend with. Once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion. What I enjoyed about this movie is that it didn't go for cheap comedy when it could have. It didn't try to pound a lesson into us. The people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light. I did have a little trouble with the Alfred Molina character having such an epiphany so quickly but within this world it needed to happen. Good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people. 
 This is an excellent show! I had a US history teacher in high school that was much like this. There are many facts in history that are not quite true and Mr Wuhl points them out very well in a way that is unforgettable. Mr Wuhl is teaching a class of film students but history students and even the general public will appreciate the witty way that he uncovers some very well known fallacies in the history of the world and strive to impress them upon that brains of his students. Use of live actors performing skits is also very entertaining. I highly recommend this series to anyone interested in having the history they learned as a child turned upside down. 
 THE FOURTH MAN (Paul Verhoeven - Netherlands 1983). A film based on a novella by Gerard Reve that works best as a thriller. That's quite surprising considering Reve roughly needs a hundred pages for just a minor plot twist and tension is the last thing on my mind when reading his work. The Fourth Man is top-heavy on symbolism. Paul Verhoeven is generally extremely preoccupied with proving something to mostly hostile critics and I'm never sure what it is exactly he is trying to prove. He usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such an unsubtle way he quickly diverges from the original idea or storyline and almost seems to forget what needs to be seen on screen and what needs to be left out. In The Fourth Man he is not as explicit on detailing the plot as he is with sex and nudity (of which there's plenty) but as in most of his films he seems afraid the audience wouldn't get it and hammers home the story with overt symbolism mixed with some supposedly shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes. There's hardly a scene without sex or full-frontal nudity most of it so maddeningly gratuitous and in your face it undermines an otherwise good story. Nevertheless when you can cope with Verhoeven's pretty obvious satiric approach it's quite an entertaining thriller at times with some intriguing plot twists and good performances all round Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabb¨¦ in particular. Camera Obscura --- 7/10 
 Okay first of I hate commenting on this thing but I felt like I had to stand up for this movie. So many people were bashing on it and I felt like people who might want to see it should get a second opinion. First off Bend It Like Beckham is not meant to be the most profound movie of the century. If that's what you're looking for go somewhere else. Just because it is an independent film does not mean it has to be artsy. It's supposed to make you feel good and you're supposed to have fun watching it and those two things are handily accomplished. Secondly the acting though not Halle Berry in Monster's Ball is still good. The movie doesn't need acting like that honestly so don't look for it. It's a family movie. If that's what you wanted you wouldn't or shouldn't even be looking into this movie honestly. Lastly It has a really cute story. I think it's thought out well and it's entertaining to watch. It's also very true to life for the most part for that culture so if you want to sit down and watch a movie that you can enjoy and feel good about when you're finished. If you're looking for something with deep thought out plot lines and big dramatic scenes this is not for you. -Lyndsay 
 A case of being in the right place at the right time. What a fascinating film. It is easy to see why Chavez is so popular with his people. He gets things done. He is accessible. And it is also easy to see why the west hates him so much. He has control of the resources of his country and gives the profits back to the people. Mostly the poor. And it easy to see how the TV stations can portray misleading images to put there case. Just like the Iraq war or the war on Terror. Or those missing WMD's. Or how about the axis of evil. People need to wake up. And get different points of view. Stop the neo cons ruling the world. Go watch this movie with an open mind. And make your own mind up. Then I suggest you see Aaron Russo's: America: Freedom to Fascism. It is not the people of America that are the problem. It is the government. 
 Here's the kind of love story that I do enjoy watching. And mostly it's for two reasons. One it concentrates of young people VERY young people. People who are still in their teens and are experiencing love for the first time or at least think they are. All of us have been there in our lives and The Man in the Moon is a magnificent reflection upon our memories maybe adding on a few more details and enhancing it further than any of us have experienced. The second reason is that is a love triangle. And I do believe that as teens it's the most dramatic. And the story is so well developed that you believe the characters could really be in love or are just so new to love that they just strongly believe they are and after a tragedy or so occurs will believe it for the rest of their lives. The cast of The Man in the Moon is full of great talented names. It stars Sam Waterston who is truly a versatile actor well capable of playing tough district attorneys as well as strict yet caring and wise fathers as in this film. Also there is Tess Harper Jason London and a young young Reese Witherspoon. You look at the young talented actress as she is at age fourteen and you think that about ten years down the road she's going to win the Academy Award. All members of the cast pull off great performances and with the dialogue of the compelling screenplay they are enhanced into looking like real people in real situations. As if it all really happened. This the kind of movie that I would like to see come out more often. Love story or not. I would love to see films that make everything look real and is not phony or disbelievable in any way. 
 Rather nasty piece of business featuring Bela Lugosi as a mad scientist (with yes a Renfield-like assistant and his mother a dwarf and yes the scientist's wife (sounds like a Greenaway movie actually lol). Lugosi gives his wife injections from dead brides (why them? Who knows?) so that his wife can keep looking beautiful. He gets the brides after doing a pretty clever trick with some orchids that makes the brides collapse at the altar. After another bride bites the dust a newspaper reporter just HAPPENS to be around for the scoop and decides to snoop around for a story. She gets all sorts of clues about the orchids and Lugosi. Heaven knows where the police were. Soon she's off to Bela's lair when she meets a sort of strange looking doctor who may or may not be eeeevil. It all cumulates in a totally far-fetched plan to have a fake wedding to capture the mad scientist but it seems that the scientist has x-ray vision as he foils her plans Oh no! What will happen? I actually liked this movie as a bit of a guilty pleasure. Lugosi is great here his hangers-on are all very very strange the story is actually quite nasty in some places which makes it all most watchable. A fun little view. 
 The quote I used for my summary occurs about halfway through THE GOOD EARTH as a captain of a Chinese revolutionary army (played by Philip Ahn) apologizes to a mob for not having time to shoot MORE of the looters among them as his unit has just been called back to the front lines. Of course the next looter about to be found out and shot is the main character of the film the former kitchen slave girl O-Lan (for whose portrayal Luise Rainer now 99-years-old won her second consecutive best actress Oscar). The next scene finds O-Lan dutifully delivering her bag of looted jewels to her under-appreciative husband farmer Wang Lung (Paul Muni) setting in motion that classic dichotomy of a man's upward financial mobility being the direct inverse of his moral decline. For a movie dealing with subject matter including slavery false accusations misogyny starvation home invasion eating family pets mental retardation infanticide exploited refugees riots civil war summary mass street executions bigamy child-beating adultery incest and insect plagues of biblical proportions THE GOOD EARTH is a surprisingly heart-warming movie. My parting thought is in the form of another classic quote from O-Lan herself (while putting the precious soup bone her son has just admitted stealing from an old woman back into the cooking pot after husband Wang Lung had angrily tossed it to the dirt floor on the other side of their hut): Meat is meat.  
 The Danes character finally let's Buddy have the awful truth. Leave me alone kiss men if you want to she screams self-righteously in front of everyone thus destroying the man who has been in love with her for so long. Nice girl. This might be the place to reconsider all of the giggly charm that Danes pours into this character. Great reason to feel sympathy for her lying in bed and dying but hey remember there are no mistakes except maybe seeing this film. Wait a minute. This irony is intended! This is actually a masterpiece of ironic wit yes! But somehow I doubt that's what the creators of this film had in mind sadly. Maybe there are a few mistakes after all. 
 Massive multiple chills down the spine! I'm surprised there's people who didn't like it! I saw it at 10 o'clock in the morning and still got scared stiff! And I've seen hundreds of thrillers/horror movies! For crying out loud I'm 22!!! I mean OK voice acting not particularly good probably even b-movie-ish. But the genuine look of terror the sound effects the flow! From the very start hitting you again and again with relentless unforgiving terrorising scenes! So many clich¨¦s yet none fails to surprise/scare! You know it's coming it's coming it's coming BOO! and you still jump off the chair. Grab a pillow and a blanket call your closest friend over and do not watch it at night! Hats off to the Japanese! 
 OK I overrated it just a bit to offset at least one of those grumpy reviews. But I did enjoy it. I didn't laugh out loud but it held my interest and pulled me along without dropping me at any point. The story built. Yeah you knew it would have an happy ending--this genre always does. Meantime it was quirky with sight gags you could miss so pay attention when you watch. Stiller and Black delivered expertly yet again. Good team. They should work together more. Don't know that it will be a cult classic but it was certainly a fun ride. Not as good as WHAT ABOUT BOB or DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS but what is? It is still worth going out of your way a little to get and watch this movie. 
 A Murder investigation goes on back stage while The Vanities on its opening night plays on to an unknowing audience. Odd combination of musical and murder mystery is worth a look for its cast its production numbers and the sheer novelty of the film. Gertrude Michael has the showy role of a bitchy actress intent on stopping the marriage between the show's stars Kitty Carlisle and Carl Brisson as well as starring in the infamous Sweet Marijuana number (which was also on a 70s Bette Midler album). So while the chorus girls shuffle around backstage bumbling detective Victor McLaglen ogles the girls while he tries to solve the backstage murder of an unknown woman. We quickly learn that the maid (Dorothy Stickney) loves Brisson from afar that the wardrobe lady (Jessie Ralph) is Brisson's mother and that the stage manager (Jack Oakie) butts into everything. Lots of plots twists among the musical numbers. The show's best-known song is Cocktails for Two. Kitty Carlisle also sings the haunting Where Do They Come From? And there's a weird rhapsody that erupts into a Harlem specialty number featuring Duke Ellington! Quite the cast. Some terrific acting here especially Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Stickney. Kitty Carlisle is quite good as well. Brisson is a total zero though. Charles Middleton plays Homer Toby Wing plays Nancy Donald Meek plays the doctor and also see if you can spot Ann Sheridan and Lucille Ball among the show girls. 
 This game show lasted just one season but was intriguing to audiences because it required visual aptitude and a steady hand. One false move would disqualify the contestant from winning the prize even though it was clear the contestant knew the correct answer. It was always exciting as the contestant began drawing wondering if they would complete the drawing or be buzzed out; allowing the other contestant to easily win the contest. It was a light-hearted show but it was clear that the contestants were often times embarrassed from a silly mistake made unintentionally. Rarely seen the game show did not survive past one single season. Only a seasoned game show addict will remember this show as it proved to be quite unpopular even though game shows were making a big return to the TV screen after the scandals of the 1950's game shows. But it was a unique concept for a game show and one that has as yet never been seen again. 
 It is not every film's job to stimulate you superficially. I will take an ambitious failure over a mass-market hit any day. While this really can't be described as a failure the sum of its parts remains ambiguous. That indecipherable quality tantalizes me into watching it again and again. This is a challenging provocative movie that does not wrap things up neatly. The problem with the movie is in its structure. Its inpenetrable plot seems to be winding up just as a second ending is tacked on. Though everything is technically dazzling the movie is exactly too long by that unit. The long-delayed climax of Leo's awakening comes about 20 minutes late. Great cinematography often comes at the expense of a decent script but here the innovative camera technique offers a wealth of visual ideas. The compositing artifice is provocative and engaging; A character is rear-projected but his own hand in the foreground isn't. The world depicted is deliberate treacherous and absurd. Keep your eyes peeled for a memorable technically astonishing assassination that will make your jaw drop. The compositions are stunning. Whomever chose to release the (out of print) videotape in the pan & scan format must have never seen it. Where is the DVD? It is unfathomable how anyone could give this much originality a bad review. You should see it at least once. You get the sense that von Trier bit off more than he could chew but this movie ends up being richer for it. I suspect he is familiar with Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent in which devious Europeans also manipulate an American dupe and several Welles movies that take delirious joy in technique as much as he does. All von Trier movies explore the plight of the naif amidst unforgiving societies. After Zentropa von Trier moved away from this type of audacious technical experiment towards dreary over-rated un-nuanced sap like Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark. 
 Trudy Lintz (Rene Russo) was one very fortunate lady many years ago. She was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had lots of extracurricular money. Her passion was animals and she devoted herself to providing a sanctuary for the furry ones on her property grounds. Trudy also raised two chimps in her home to be more like children. They dressed in clothes and had many amenities. One day she learns of an abandoned baby gorilla. Knowing nothing about the large apes she relies on her husband's medical abilities and expert advice to save the gorilla's life. Once out of danger Trudy decides she will raise the gorilla also as one of her children. This works well for years and Buddy the gorilla is truly a remarkably intelligent addition to her home. But Buddy is also a gorilla and his strength and curiosity become quite enormous. Will Trudy be able to keep Buddy under control? For those who love animals Buddy is a must-see movie. Based on a true story Trudy and her ape develop a relationship that is unique in the annals of animal history and lore. Of course Buddy is not a real gorilla but a mechanical one in the film but he is very close to seeming totally real. Russo gives a nice performance as a lady ahead of her time and the supporting players are also quite nice. The costumes are exemplary as befitting the earlier era of the story and the settings and production values outstanding. But most importantly animals are here in abundance not only Buddy but the adorable chimps the ducks the rabbits and so forth. For those who want to watch a film and be transported to animal heaven here on earth this is a great movie choice. All animal lovers and even those who just want to watch a great family film will go ape over Buddy. 
 Everything is idyllic in Suburbia when the little family moves in as the father have got a new job in a computer company there. But no paradise would be complete without its snake. Strange things happens as the family joins the local country club without the husband as it certainly holds secrets. The father is not a joiner but pressure is on him to join as everyone who is anything in the neighborhood and at work are members. Robert Urich's good guy part is a bit tepid but Joanna Cassidy as good natured housewife turning nasty sizzles. Suspenseful and well-made chiller with a bitchy Susan Lucci as club chairperson. Look out for cult favorite Michael Berryman in a bit part as a valet. The movie captures the sense of paranoia and the special effects final is worth waiting for. I have seen this movie quite a few times. 
 Unfortunately many consumers who write reviews for IMDb equate low budget with not good. Whatever else this movie might need more budget really isn't part of it. Big sets and lots of special effects would have turned it into another Lara Croft movie. What we have here is a step or two better than that. The nearly unknown Alexandra Staden is captivating as the enigmatic Modesty and this is crucial for this movie to work. Her wise little smiles and knowing looks are formidable and you find yourself wishing that the camera won't leaver her face. It makes it workable that the bad guy Nikolai played by also little known (in the U.S. at least) Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau might take an unusually cerebral interest in her something Modesty can exploit. She is able to divert his raping her with just a shove and spitting out stop wasting my time! then storming off between his heavily armed yet suddenly diffident henchmen. Making a scene like that plausible doesn't happen by accident. Probably the biggest problem I have with the rail-thin Staden playing Modesty is it just isn't very believable for her to go hand to hand with an athletic and muscled looking guy like Coaster-Waldau and beat him. She just ain't a Peta Wilson or a pumped-up Hilary Swank type actress who can throw a convincing punch. Coaster-Waldau letting himself be overpowered by Staden looks like he's just roughhousing with his little sister. Since this is not really an action film this isn't a big flaw. I just hope they do better on that if and when they make sequels. 
 Actor Herman Jos¨¦ plays the role of a football of a soccer entrepreneur that acquires the pass of two African players and tries to sell them for very little money to the rival club of the Benfica (club of its heart) FC Porto therefore these players did not play well and it wanted that the FC Port was wronged with this. But what happens is that these two players after all are good and FC Porto sell them for much money to a foreign club making a good business. The film for a small country as Portugal without great antecedents in great films is a very good and funny comedy showing all the rivalry that exists between North/South of Portugal (FC Porto/Benfica). Highly recommended 
 I have NOT seen this movie but I must. Having read all three of Thor Heyerdahl's books (Kon Tiki Ra and Aku Aku) I am actively looking for a copy of this movie. The thesis that Peruvians migrated to Polynesia is alive and well. Considering that this crew had NO GPS and only an old fashioned valve (tube) radio with a 6-watt output their voyage was heroic to say the least. Please reply to this message if you can tell me the location of a copy of this video. I would be interested in buying it. 
 First off this really is my favorite film ever. I don't need to give anyone a description because every a**hole does that. I am literally obsessed with this practically bloodless cheesy lame effects having' boom-stick showing' badly edited 80's metal horror masterpiece. The director (I heard) had hoped for a hit at the box office so that he could do sequels and have a FREDDY/JASON type of deal for himself. Damn I wish that could've went down like that! The soundtrack's banging'. The acting's good....CHECK THIS MOFO OUT. and any die-hard fans out there feel free to email and chat sometime. Midgetorgy....I can be found at YAHOO. 
 Election marks the 2nd trial society theme movie directed by Johnnie To. To marvellously casted Simon Yan and Tony Leung Kar Fai as Lok and Big D as the two trial members who were chosen as candidates for the position of chairman for Ho Sing society a 100 year old trial society. While Lok is a man who keeps his cool at all times Big D is not only impatient but also thinks that he is on top of everything. Lok was chosen as the next chairman for 2 years. To have the total control of the gang the newly elected chairman must be passed down with a Dragon Baton which represents power and authority. Big D was extremely unhappy with the results that he was not chosen to be the next chairman after paying a handsome figure of bribes to the council members. He ordered his man to get the Baton before it falls onto the hands of Lok. While Big D is getting the Baton Lok has other plans for him. This is one of the trial society theme movies where not much bloodshed is needed. Johnnie To puts the greed of the human beings in the movie where bloodshed is commonly used in other trial society theme movies to show how the greed of human beings can caused the death or the downfall of one. However no single bullet is used hardly any gangfights are involved in Election. It's the battle of the wits that makes Election stands out of the rest. Apart from Maggie Shiu the only actress in Election with less than 5 lines to talk in the whole movie masculinity rules the whole movie. Louis Koo and Nick Cheung who was seen in To's previous film are casted as an undercover cop and a gangster who sold his life to the gang respectively. Together with some of the veteran actors making their appearance in the film and the excellent script it makes the only HK movie to represent Cannes Fil Festival 2005. Election has hardly failed any critics who wants an different trial society theme movie. 
 I can't understand what it is that fans of the genre didn't like about this film. It was truly a lot of fun. The special effects were wonderful. I generally agree with reviews and with IMDB voters but not this time. I waited until it came to home video which I felt was another reason that I wouldn't enjoy the film. I believe special effects films need to be seen on the big screen but again this was not the case. To me the film begs comparison to two films that were released around the same time. Blair Witch and The Mummy. Both films that I thought were terrible. Blair was probably the most overrated horror film of all time. The Mummy made gobs of money and it was pure dreck. People liked it for it's special effects. Films like the Mummy and The Haunting are not rich in character development they are more like funhouse rides. Well with that analogy the Mummy was a B ticket to the Haunting's E-ticket. 
 After a chance encounter on the train a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of Vienna discussing life and love. The primary reason to see Before Sunrise is to watch a young Julie Delpy deliver her lines. As Celine this sexy brainy soulful brown-eyed blond is sort of a cross between Brigitte Bardot and Joni Mitchell as they were in their mid-twenties. Risking overstatement Celine is practically the ideal woman unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural unpretentious introspective and selflessly loving. We can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak for her sincere intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating. Further her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks English with a French accent that is very endearing. If there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar. Ethan Hawke as Jessie comes off like a vaguely appealing slob sort of a Maynard G. Krebs of the nineties. Attempting to appear detached and nonchalant he sort of drags himself through certain shots. His pants fit poorly his tee shirt is coming untucked his wavy dark hair (his most attractive feature) needs a good washing and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee. Nevertheless he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a two-week train ride around Europe so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine. His oft-cynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic Celine although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation. When he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence we know he is getting somewhere. After blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes bars and silly diversions they agree that because they may never see one another again they should make the most of it. Jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up. Given his boundless luck in the romance department it is especially irksome when Jessie as the very definition of a naive jerk foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp. He contents himself with a half-baked plan quickly devised at the railroad station when he bids her adieu to reunite at the same spot in half a year. When the appointed time comes you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another perhaps even married and pregnant. For whatever reason she probably won't show while Jesse who ends up working at Target or (if he's lucky) the local library will go back to Vienna desperate to see her again only to wind up alone. Despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion Before Sunrise is a beautiful movie. I highly recommend both it and the sequel Before Sunset.  
 Samuel Fuller is hardly one of America's great directors. I'm not sure he qualifies as one of Hollywood's great craftsmen. But he certainly ranks up there with the best of Hollywood's true professionals who were willing to march to their own music. During the time he worked for Hollywood studios he knew how to take an assignment shape the middling material handed to him and then turn it quickly and efficiently into something usually better than its parts...on time and on budget. Pickup on South Street is a case in point. On the surface it's one more of Hollywood's early Fifties' anti-Commie movies complete with appeals to patriotism a hard-boiled hero and a slimy (and copiously perspiring) bad guy. Fuller turns this bag of Hollywood clich¨¦s into a taut exciting drama with any number of off-kilter twists. The hero Skip McCoy is a three-time loser a petty crook with soft fingers who doesn't change his stripes until the very end. The girl in the caper Candy has a level of virtue that would be easy to step over if you're so inclined. One of the most appealing characters Moe Williams is a stoolie. And in an unusual approach to Hollywood's battle against Commies the appeals to patriotism fall on deaf ears; the hero isn't motivated by anything so ennobling. He just wants payback for a personal reason and winds up becoming...at least for now...a good guy. Plus all the actors were mostly assigned to Fuller by the studio. He had to make do. Richard Widmark by now had established his presence as an actor and star but Jean Peters is a surprise. She gives a fine portrait of a woman sexy and dumb and no better than her boy friends...or her clients...want her to be. And Richard Kiley who later would become a two- time Tony award winning star on Broadway is convincingly slippery and cowardly. It's hard to remember that he was the actor who inflicted on us I mean introduced to us The Impossible Dream from Man of La Mancha More than anything else this tale of a pickpocket who picks a purse in a subway car and finds himself with microfilmed secrets instead of cash pursued by the Feds and the Commies moves straight ahead with great economy. The whole enterprise with a classic noir look only takes 80 minutes to tell. The dialogue with Fuller as screenwriter has that party corny partly pungent hard-boiled pulp fiction style. That muffin you grifted...she's okay one character says to Skip about Candy. Fuller moves us just fast enough from scene to scene to keep us hanging on what will come next. Then Fuller throws in the character of Moe Williams. All of a sudden the story ratchets up to a whole new level of interest part comedy relief and part sad inevitability. The thing I like best about the movie is how the opening exemplifies Fuller's talents and strengths. In 2 minutes and 15 seconds starting right after the credits Fuller is able to instantly power up the movie to establish for us what the story is about and to show us what kind of characters -- Skip and Candy -- we're going to be involved with. And he does this with so much enticing curiosity in that hot packed subway car that we can just about feel Fuller setting the hook to catch us. Says Glenn Erickson in my opinion one of the best of movie critics In what should be an inconsequential story Sam Fuller defines his peculiar view of Americanism from the bottom up: stiff-necked aggressive self-interest that when fully expressed recognizes what's wrong and what's right and isn't afraid to fight for it. As always in his work the individuals who fight the hardest for their country are the ones least likely to benefit from the effort. He's right and it makes for a movie still vivid after 55 years. 
 I do miss the company Vestron they sure had their finger on the pulse of unique and unusual cinema back in the 1980s. This is very apparent with the astonishing Paperhouse a film that touches me deeply each and every time I watch it. The idea of a girl manipulating a dream world with her drawings (thusly the dream world manipulating reality) and also connecting with and affecting the life of a boy she's never actually met is fascinating and never disappoints. Charlotte Burke at first seems quite precocious and yet you warm up to her because by being a bit of a mischievous child it makes it hard for the adults to believe what she is experiencing. She becomes very self aware and strong towards the end even finding she doesn't hate boys as she so defiantly claimed at first. Through this we are treated to many touching moments and some immensely scary ones all visually stunning with a grand score from Hans Zimmer. I'm quite proud to be an owner of the soundtrack on CD when it was released in the United States on RCA Victor. At the time of this writing there is no DVD of Paperhouse yet available in the U.S. (only in Europe) here's hoping one of my wishes will come true as I truly cherish this beautiful film and a DVD of it would be very welcome! It's satisfying watching the girl work out her thoughts like a puzzle game trying to make the dream world work for her and her newfound friend Marc (Elliot Spiers). Both Charlotte Burke and Elliot Spiers do a magnificent job throughout I find the editorial comment on Amazon.com about it being hammy acting quite perplexing -- I found every aspect of Paperhouse to be exhilarating. Even in minor scenes of brilliance like when Charlotte and the girl in the classroom are staring at each other through the glass on a door it's quite powerful. You don't have to be an arthouse type to enjoy Paperhouse just be a person that enjoys a film that stimulates and has you wanting more. There is enough in this film to invite repeated viewings and I'm still in awe of the cinematography and sets. For me it's never like watching the same film twice as there are so many details to absorb and savor. A very emotional experience indeed. While there are many films I adore there are only a few specific ones that strike a great emotional chord in me: films like Paperhouse Static Resurrection and Donnie Darko. When I see so much drek out there passing as films that will easily be forgotten and in bargain bins all I have to do is watch Paperhouse and my faith in wondrous storytelling is renewed. 
 Joseph Brady and Clarence Doolittle are two sailors who have a four-day shore leave in Hollywood.Joe knows everything about girls and can't wait to see Lola while Clarence is shyer and needs some advice from his buddy on how to meet girls.They then run into a little boy Donald Martin who has ran away in order to join the navy.They take him home and meet his beautiful aunt Susan who wants to be a singer.Clarence wants Susie to be his girl but his shyness gets in the way.But he doesn't feel shy with a waitress who comes from Brooklyn like he does.Soon Joe notices he's in love with Susie.The boys are in a fix when they lie to Susie on meeting with a big time music producer they don't even know.As they are in a fix with their feelings.George Sidney's Anchors Aweigh (1945) is a great musical comedy.Gene Kelly is top-notch once again in his singing and dancing routines.Frank Sinatra is terrific as the shy guy from Brooklyn.Shy isn't the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Frank Sinatra but he plays his part well.Kathryn Grayson is fantastic as Susan Abbott.We sadly lost this gifted actress and operatic soprano singer last month at the age of 88.The 9-year old Dean Stockwell does amazing job as the little fellow wanting to become a sailor.Jose Iturbi does great job performing himself.It's magic what he does with the piano.Edgar Kennedy plays Chief of police station.Sara Berner is the voice of Jerry Mouse.There's a lot of great stuff in this movie and some fantastic singing and dancing numbers.Just look at Kelly and Sinatra performing We Hate to Leave .It's so energetic. If You Knew Susie (Like I Know Susie) is quite funny.It's a nice moment when Frank sings Brahms' Lullaby to little Dean Stockwell.It's lovely to listen to Grayson singing the tango Jealousy .The most memorable sequence is the one that takes into the animated fantasy world and there Gene sings and dances with Jerry Mouse.Also Tom Cat is seen there as the butler.They originally asked Mickey Mouse but he refused.The movie was nominated for five Oscars but Georgie Stoll got one for Original Music Score.Anchors Aweigh is some high class entertainment. 
 Being half-portuguese doesn't render me half-blind (nor half-prejudiced) when discussing portuguese films. Not that I get to do that very often anyway. But this film was such a rush of adrenaline! Yes that's right - it was mostly accurate as far as history went/goes - but it pulled no punches on venturing beyond usual portuguese-film territory: things like using real locations in the middle of traffic-congested Lisbon and recruiting a real crowd to stand in for the real crowd of almost 30 years ago. And by God did they get it right! OK to sum it up: very emotional if you've lived through it but you'll spot minor improvements that could have been made as well as plot necessities that were. If you're just watching it randomly you're in for a good historical romp only of the very recent History kind and a bit more thought-proving than usual. Even by European standards yes. 
 Forget Neo and Bourne and all those half-baked made up modern heroes. They only look 12 year-oldish to please the wide audience of geeks that want to be their heroes. Since they cannot be Rambo or McClane or even Indiana Jones Hollywood allowed a bunch of fakes that have no beard and yet fulfill teenagers wishes to see something that looks very much like an action flick. However their action set-pieces are just painful to watch and any girl may challenge their masculinity without question. This explains the recrudescence of oldies on our silver screens over the past few years. For better ( Rocky Rambo ) or worse ( Die Hard 4 - where John McClane brace yourselves.... had no beard !! ) I say it is high-time a new hero walked up and put their reign to an end. This Largo Winch movie is far from perfect and perhaps too predictable at times but at least Tomer Sisley delivered a very promising performance as an action-hero. And the only one time where he was weakened is when M¨¦lanie Thierry shaved his beard ! I rest my case. I didn't know it when I entered the theater room but this might be the movie I've been waiting for a decade. For the first time in France since Belmondo can a movie be both well- crafted and rooted in B-genre without blushing over its performance. In the meantime all we had to chew on was either a gigantic pile of dung or something too restricted to reach a wider audience... In other words it was Le Pacte des Loups or Dobermann ( I like Dobermann mind you )... I believe Largo Winch has what it takes to be both popular and quality film-making. I exited the theater room very pleased and hungry for more. 
 What a fun movie experience! I was expecting a sappy kids movie and found that I enjoyed it more than my teens. Take a tissue it's not sad just 'moving' in parts. Finally its a 'feel good' flick for the whole family. Note: It's 2+ hours so consider leaving the littlest 'squirmers' home for this one. AP 
 This is my first comment! This is a fantastic movie! I watched it all by luck one night on TV. At first 5 minutes i thought it was a B movie but afterward i understood what an amazing product this was. I suggested to some friends to see the movie only to tell me that it was a bad B movie. How wrong. Superficial critiques. I think that the movie is almost a product of genius! The well known director made an excellent job here and it is a shame to tell that he was out of the game all this time. 
 Why did it sound like the husband kept calling her Appy ? It ruined a great episode and so I can only give it a 6. Proper grammar and pronunciation are essential to a film. It was very Hellraiser what with all the skin ripping though I dunno how anyone can survive without skin the skin is a vital organ to the body the biggest organ actually and without we would die. The more a horror film is true the more creepy it can be and more entertaining. I do admit though that the stories from the great horror directors are very disappointing and very mediocre. 6/10 come on Yankies get your English up to par ! 
 Even though Ian Kershaw distanced himself from this project due to inaccuracies in regards to Hitler's life and yes this is dramatised but essential. Robert Carlyle plays Hitler during his later years during this documentary that only deals with Hitler from boyhood until he became Chancellor of Germany including The Night of the Long Knives. This TV-film (also a two-part mini-series) shows how a series of factors allowed Hitler to come to power e.g. the financial disaster of 1930. The series follows Hitler and little else apart from the lives of Fritz Gerlich and Ernst Hanfstaengl. All in all valuable and filled with interesting actors yet I feel it should have been more tightly directed with stronger cinematography; most actors are portrayed in half-body shots which (for me) makes for a theatrical stance not cinematic. The tempo is at times drowsy and the film does suffer from it being approximately 2 5 hours long. 
 envy is not as funny as i thought it would initially be but after some of the reviews i read i found it to be much funnier than people was giving it props for now true its not a gag a minute movie like zoolander or dodgeball but ben stiller and jack black work well with each other and christopher walken is as great as ever so the story is about jack black's character inventing a spray that makes dog pooh disappear obviosly ben wants no part of it but when the product makes jack black rich ben stiller starts to see the envy its not great by all means and both ben stiller and jack black have funnier and better movies under their belt but if your a fan of either i recommend this as its still a funny flick and i laughed my ass off quite a few times as a big fan of ben stiller id have to say this is a lesser stiller but still great fun give it a watch 
 OK so Soldier isn't deep and meaningful like Blade Runner or as big budget as Terminator 2 but on the whole I found it quite enjoyable. The fact that Kurt Russell stayed in character not speaking and being virtually emotionless made the moments when his humanity broke through all the more poignant. I found his portrayal of restricted emotional development more touching than Arnie's in the T films (and before I get comments yes I know that Arnie was a cyborg and Kurt was human but the premise put forward by both films was the same). So to the film itself a reasonable US/Brit cast are able to flesh out this little story. Not really sure if Gary Busey and his two deputies were baddies or goodies so was unable to decide whether I liked them or not. The colony was a little more realistic neither a misguided bunch of peace loving/gullible/cowardly hicks who get wiped out from the get go nor a group of subversive aggressive terrorists paranoid about offworlders and each other. Kurt Russell is good and unlike other comments I do not feel this will have a negative impact on his career (unlike maybe Escape from LA - sequels are such fickle creatures!). Sean Pertwee has really done his late father proud by continuing the families noble Sci-Fi lineage. And the rest of the cast helped flesh out this pathetic band of people making the most of a bad situation and not doing too badly. If you see this on your TV schedule I would recommend giving it a chance. I don't think you will be disappointed. 
 A year or so ago I was watching the TV news when a story was broadcast about a zombie movie being filmed in my area. Since then I have paid particular attention to this movie called 'Fido' as it finished production and began playing at festivals. Two weeks ago Fido began playing in my local theater. And just yesterday I read a newspaper article which stated Fido is not attracting audiences in it's limited release with the exception of our local theater. In fact here it is outdrawing all other shows at The Paramount Theater including 300. Of course this makes sense as many locals want to see their city on screen or spot themselves roaming around in zombie make-up. And for any other locals who haven't seen Fido yet but are considering it I can say there are many images on screen from the school to city park to the forbidden zone that you will recognize. In fact they make the Okanagan Valley look beautiful. That's right beautiful scenery in a zombie movie! However Fido itself is a very good movie. Yes despite its flaws it is better then most of the 20 other movies playing in my local market. Fido is best described as an episode of Lassie in which the collie has been replaced by a member of the undead. This is a clever premise. And the movie even goes further by taking advantage of the 1950's emphasize on conformity and playing up the cold-war paranoia which led to McCarthyism. Furthermore it builds on the notion that zombies can be tamed or trained which George Romero first introduced in Day Of The Dead. K'Sun Ray plays a small town boy who's mother (Carrie-Ann Moss) longs for a zombie servant so she can be like all the other house wives on her block. However his dad (Dylan Baker) is against the idea as he once had to kill his own 'zombie father'. Eventually the family does acquire a zombie named 'Fido' (played by Billy Connolly) and adjusts to life with the undead. Billy Connolly was inspired casting. He is able to convey Fido's confusion longing hatred and loyalty through only his eyes lumbering body and grunts. Connolly shows that he can play understated characters better than his outrageously comedic ones. This is his best role since Mrs. Brown. Fido follows in the footsteps of other recent zomcoms such as Shawn Of The Dead and Zombie Honeymoon. Being someone who appreciates Bruce Campbell and Misty Mundae movies more than Eli Roth and Jigsaw ones I prefer humor over gore in my horror. However I understand the criticism of those horror fans who feel there is not enough 'undead carnage' in Fido. Yet I am sure patient viewers will be rewarded by the films gentle humor. The movie does break down in it's third act. It's as if the writers were so wrapped up in the cute premise of domesticated zombies in the 1950s they forgot about the story arc. However given my interest in horror comedies and my appreciation for seeing the neighborhood on screen I rate Fido 9 out of 10. 
 When I first saw this movie the first thing I thought was this movie was more like an anime than a movie. The reason is because it involves vampires doing incredible stunts. The stunts are very much like the Matrix moves like the moving too fast for bullets kinda thing and the jumping around very far. Another reason why I the movie is good is because the adorable anime faces they do during the movie. The way Gackt does his pouting faces or just the way they act VERY ANIME. I think that it's a really good movie to watch. ^_^ The action in this movie is a 10 (not to mention Gackt and Hyde too are a 10). ^_~ If you are Gackt and Hyde fans you have to see it. 
 If you're one of those who recognise with pleasure such arcane titles as 'Book of the Dead' 'Book of Eibon' or 'Necronomicon' then you should feel right at home with Malefique a film which also features an occult tome one with the power to change the destinies of all involved. Discovered by four French prisoners sharing a cell the fearsome object has been placed in the wall there by Danvers a serial killer incarcerated back in the 1920s; a man obsessed with rejuvenation and the black arts before he abruptly vanished. Finders of the book are Carr¨¨re (G¨¦rald Laroche) a company embezzler shopped by his wife Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) who aspires to be a woman but at the same time body-builds to execute an escape plan the halfwit Paquerette (Dimitri Rataud) who once ate his baby sister and the 'librarian' Marcus (Clovis Cornillac) supposedly driven mad by reading who murdered his wife. Reminding the viewer of Meat Loaf's equally bizarre bosomy male in Fight Club (1999) Lassalle begins as the dominant member of the quartet one who is especially protective of the infantile Paquerette. With the coming of the book however and the overarching need to decipher its dangerous contents Marcus assumes greater and greater significance. At first assured of an early bail meanwhile Carr¨¨re takes little more than academic interest in events. Suddenly he too needs an urgent escape option and as the prisoners experiment Danvers' book starts to reveal some of its terrifying powers... Staged for the most part within a prison cell and between four or five characters Malefique has a claustrophobic air entirely suited to its subject matter (as well as the limited budget of the filmmakers). Only at the start and then at the conclusion do we get to leave the confines of the cell a necessary opening out which only serves to emphasise the doomed closed-in nature of proceedings elsewhere. More than anything this is a film about being trapped either as a victim of your criminal past or of occult events now unfolding. I'm going to escape says Carr¨¨re at the start of the film wishing more than anything to be able to rejoin his wife and son. Whether or not he does it will be at a terrible price and the great irony of the film is that the ultimate form of an 'escape' may not be one a man might imagine. With all its budget limitations it is greatly to the first-time feature director Eric Vallette's credit that his film succeeds as well as it does. As critics have noticed it is a film with strong Freudian overtones - Lassalle's distinctive mammaries and adult breast feeding for instance; the picture of a vagina which comes to life and develops an eye; the grown man who dissolves back into a foetus; Danvers' original placenta fetish; the dark cell as a primitive womb from which 'delivery' is awaited etc. With so many interesting aspects to the script Vallette hardly puts a foot wrong and he succeeds in creating a genuinely unsettling atmosphere out of what when one comes down to it is just a matter of four guys four bunks one folding table and a book. There's a genuine growing Lovecraftian frisson as the men summon up the unnameable darkness from within its pages while one or two moments - the aforementioned blinking vagina or what ultimately happens to Paquerette - are unsettlingly memorable. The pacing of many of the dark events in Malefique is deliberate rejecting the rapid cutting of many Hollywood productions: a video culture approach that often subverts the horrified gaze in favour of quick-fix action and gore. Perhaps this is a particularly European manner as one recalls a similar measured approach to shocking hallucination taken in such films as Verhoeven's The Fourth Man (1983) - a film that incidentally also shares a particularly nasty image based around a prolapsed eye. Lensed well in 1.85:1 Malefique benefits from excellent performances and if for this viewer at least the conclusion was not as explainable as it might have been the journey to the final shot was worth taking. Coming so soon after the release of the similarly well-received Haute Tension (aka: Switchblade Romance 2003) this is another reason to be grateful that good horror films are once again emerging from the French industry this after a time when it seemed the only worthwhile product came from Asia 
 SPOILERS This is a gripping movie about grifters. But who is conning who here? When does the hunter turn into the prey? This gritty dark movie is slow moving and seductive. It pulls you in and drags you down the proverbial garden path only to waylay you just as you think you are safe. It has a riveting script with good acting (at least from the leads). I didn't notice the background music but it was never jarring so it must have been done right. I was very surprised that I liked this movie because I don't usually go for this genre but this one sucked me in and kept he hooked until the end. 
 It's a gentle easy-going 1950s comedy. Kim Novak belongs to a coven of witches in Manhattan. She puts a spell on neighbor Jimmy Stewart out of boredom but eventually falls in love with him losing her powers. See witches are permitted to have hot blood but not love. Elsa Lanchester is Novak's aunt also a witch. Jack Lemmon is her brother ditto. Hermione Gingold is the chief witch and Ernie Kovacks is Sidney Redlich an author who specializes in writing about witches. I described it as a 1950s comedy because it could hardly be mistaken for anything else. Everything is so smooth and polished from the set decoration through wardrobe and plot to the performances and direction. Take the character of Ernie Kovacks. He's referred to as a drunk and a nut. And here's how the movie demonstrates these traits. He asks for a second drink and though he always wears a jacket and tie like the other gentlemen his hair is a bit long and tousled. That's a strictly 1950s version of a drunk and a nut. Nothing is out of place; everything is tidy and free of dust. The soles of Jimmy Stewart's shoes are barely scuffed. And the Zodiac Club where the witches hang out. It's called a low dive. Yet it's a clean dark place with polite waiters a quintet of musicians neatly dressed client¨¨le and potted plants against bare brick walls. That is not my idea or yours of a low dive -- not even for Greenwich Village in 1958. My idea of a dive in Greenwich Village is Julius's or The White Horse Tavern or The San Remo or The Swing Rendezvous a now defunct lesbian hangout. The Zodiac Club is a high dive compared to these. The kookiness we always hear about is muted by today's standards. I mean Kim Novak is odd because she runs around her apartment in her bare feet. And she wears a lot of black clothes like the Beatniks of the period did. But never mind all that. It's an enjoyable romantic comedy. Kim Novak is effective as Gillian who runs a primitive art shop for the uptrodden. She has a strange beauty bulky and ethereal at the same time. She glides rather than walks a wispy presence. Her eyebrows seem drawn with a set of plastic French curves. And Jimmy Stewart is quite good as the bewildered and bewitched victim. In the 1930s he usually played in light roles. In the postwar years and for much of the 1950s he was the tortured protagonist but here he puts his early experience in comedy to good use. Who could resist laughing when Hermione Gingold forces him to wear a shawl and drink a hideous concoction of putrid fluid in order to cure him of Novak's spell? It's good to see him as a stooge instead of the angry and indignant man of principle he was in danger of becoming. Richard Quine directs the movie quietly without fireworks or special effects and does some interesting things that the play couldn't have had. Note the scene in which Novak casts the spell over Stewart when the Siamese cat's face and ears seem to merge with Novak's startling eyes. Ernie Kovacks in the 1950s was a well-known television personality. There was never anything quite like The Ernie Kovacks Show before -- or after. It brings the word surrealism to mind. He could stage five minutes worth of wordless and indescribable tricks in an unpopulated room with only Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra as background. And he did an unimpeachable sketch using the character of Percy Dovetail an effete poet. The credits kind of skip over The Condoli Brothers but that's rather casual because these two guys -- Pete and Conte -- were virtuoso trumpeters with independent careers in jazz ensembles. Conte was later a member of Doc Severison's band on Johnny Carson's Late Show. The third act kind of bogs down a little and becomes more romantic than comedy . But it's never dull. The whole film rolls along as neatly as Van Druten's play and the kids will probably get a kick out of it too. 
 This movie is the only movie to feature a scene in which Michael Jackson wields a Tommy Gun. Plain and simple. This movie rocks because it is freaking' hilarious! It may be creepy to see Jacko w/ little kids but this movie also stars.......................................... wait for it ..................... JOE PESCI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Think about it Joe Pesci and Jacko with Tommy guns throwing coins into jukeboxes from 20 feet away? Whats not to like? As stated before THIS MOVIE ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!! ! !!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 THE SOPRANOS (1999-2007) Number 1 - Television Show of all Time Everyone thought this would be a stupid thing that wouldn't go past a pilot episode. The Sopranos has become a cultural phenomenon and universally agreed as one of the greatest television shows of all time. James Gandolfini plays the enigmatic New Jersey crime boss Tony Soprano accompanied by a stellar cast. Edie Falco is superb as the worrying loving upper-middle class mother; Tony Sirico is tremendous as a superstitious greying consiglieri who is often very funny. While the show has often been criticised for the negative stereotype of Italian-Americans as mafiosi and to an extent this is undeniable I can see so many positives from the show. The portrayal of strong family values friendships love and compassion; could this be present in a coarse television show about gangsters? Yes. Furthermore other burning issues are discussed such as terrorism social inequality and injustice homosexuality drugs etc. This is no shallow dull show about tough guys and violence. It has so much more. Many of the issues we see on the show are very real. The writing which has been pretty much great has infused so successfully current issues and managed to imbred them within the characters' lives which makes the whole thing more interesting. Credit must go to David Chase who has created an excellent television treasure and to James Gandolfini for envisioning television's most complex and enigmatic character. Simply exceptional. 10/10 
 Jane Eyre has always been my favorite novel! When I stumbled upon this movie version in the late 90's I was ecstatic! This is the best and most complete version of the book on film! This version is a little long to sit through in one sitting but well worth it. Timothy Dalton is amazing as Rochester. I was glad that they cast a normal looking actress (Zelah Clark) as Jane and not a glamorous person. I love the sets and the location. For anyone who is a true Jane Eyre fan this is the version to watch!!! For those of you who are interested I just found this version on DVD. I have watched my VHS copy almost to breaking so I was thrilled to find it on DVD. 
 Road to Perdition a movie undeservedly overlooked at that year Oscars is the second work of Sam Mendes (and in my opinion his best work) a director who three years before won Oscar for his widely acclaimed but controversial American Beauty. This is a terrific movie and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad. It's a story of a relatively wealthy and happy family from outward appearance during difficult times of Depression when the Michael Sullivan a father of two children played by great Tom Hanks (I'm not his admirer but ought to say that) is a hit-man for local mafia boss played by Paul Newman. His eldest son a thirteen years boy Michael Sullivan Jr. perfectly played by young Tyler Hoechlin after years of blissful ignorance finds out what is his father job and on what money their family live. Prompted by his curiosity and his aspiration to know truth he accidentally becomes a witness of a murder committed by John Rooney son of his father boss. Such discovery strikes an innocent soul and it caused numerous events that changed his life forever. The atmosphere of the period all the backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created editing and cinematography are almost flawless while the story is well written. But the main line of the movie the most important moments and points of the movie and the key factor of the movie success are difficult father-son relations in bad times. They are shown so deeply strong and believable. Tom Hanks does excellent and has one of the best performances of his career in a quite unusual role for him and all acting across the board is superb. Finally worth to mention a very nice score by Paul Newman and in the result we get an outstanding work of all people involved in making this beautiful (but one more time sad) masterpiece. I believe Road to Perdition belongs to greatest achievements of film-making of this decade and undoubtedly one of the best films of the year. My grade 10 out of 10 
 Director Douglas Sirk scores again with this the grandaddy of all dysfunctional family films. This lush trashy saga is a masterpiece beautifully combining all of the elements of Sirk's soapers and strategically placing them all into one movie. Written on the Wind very obviously influenced the 1980s TV series Dallas and Dynasty as this is basically a feature-length version of those later nighttime soaps. Lauren Bacall wonderfully and subtly plays Lucy Moore a New York City secretary who marries oil baron Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Unbeknownst to both of them Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is also in love with the quiet but sexy secretary. They all go back to Kyle's family's mansion in Texas where we meet his white trash slut-of-a-sister Marylee (Dorothy Malone in an Oscar-winning turn). Yipee! The sparks begin to fly - from the romances to the catfights this is a campy trip. Not only does Mitch have to fight the feelings he has for his best friend's wife but Marylee tries to sleep with everybody since she can't have her one true love who is Mitch. Topping it all off Kyle learns he's impotent but somehow Lucy ends up pregnant. This is pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment. How can you not love it? This film signals one of Universal's most popular films and one of director Sirk's best works. Some of the dialogue is absolutely sizzling and visual metaphors are thrown in every which way - the theme of wind throughout is great. The cast is great although Bacall is completely underused despite receiving top-billing behind Hudson. Stack's Oscar loss reportedly devastated him. He considered this his finest performance and apparently was none too pleased to lose out. And he did turn out a fabulous performance as the whimpering alcoholic. What a stunning movie! This film proves what I've been thinking for ages - Sirk is the master of classic melodrama. Where's his Oscar? 
 Its too bad a lot of people didn't understand this and the next episode. But don't worry! ill explain it too you :) This episode is split in 2 parts. first part is Tony's Dream in his coma. Second part is what happens in real life. now what people didn't understand is that Tony's dream is more then just a dream. in this episode its about his preparation for his Death. He loses his own identity and eventually even forgets himself thus he disconnects all his bindings with this world. You will notice what I'm saying at the doctor scene where tony says he has lost his briefcase which contains his life . They makers really did a superb job of interpreting they're own thoughts of what happens when you die. If you understand the whole plot you will find this and the next episode an unique thing with great spiritual meanings. Like every sopranos episode the acting and filming is superb. Only thing i didn't understand was what the role where of the monks. gonna re watch it till i get this. anyways this episode really touched me and i don't think anyone else can make a better view of what happens in a almost death experience. 10/10 no doubt. 
 It is always a nice suprise when a film made for TV turns out to be entertaining such as Little Richard. This is a very watchable film about the story of Rock and Roller Little Richard played by an actor called Leon who i have never seen before but does an very good job. As most TV films this is a little tamer than if made for Cinema which is a shame because i am sure there is lot we could have seen about Little Richard that was controversial. Instead we see a lot religous rubbish which is the only thing that spoils the film and eventually spoilt a very promising career. All in all this film is good and the acting is above average fot a TV film. 7 out of 10. 
 I don't think anyone besides Terrence Malick and maybe Tran Anh Hung makes cinema on a purer level than Claire Denis. That said I don't love this her newest film quite as much as her 2001 masterpiece Trouble Every Day (although it comes very close) which itself is one of my absolute favorite films. It it only because the narrative here is possibly slightly too elliptical for it's own good. Don't get me wrong the fact that this film barely has a plot at all is really one of the best things about it but I think Denis took it about one degree farther than it needed to go and consequently the film does flirt with incomprehensibility and a few key plot points should have been clarified somehow (like that the main character goes to South Korea to get his heart transplant instead of just showing him there all of a sudden without any explanation of where he is or why he is there). Also some of the other characters seemed unnecessary and as if they were just excuses for Denis to use actors she likes yet again (Beatrice Dalle's character in particular is a little distracting because you keep expecting that she is going to have some significance). Still the film is incredibly absorbing and the cinematography is beyond amazing. It is definitely very much a masterpiece in it's own way. At least as good as Denis' more highly-acclaimed Beau travail if not better. Claire Denis has to be my favorite French director at this point better than Leos Carax even. Also I have to admit that the South Korean sequence really does do Lost in Translation better than that film itself does (and I unlike some am a huge fan of that film as well). 
 I knew about but had never seen Grey Gardens before I saw the Broadway musical of the same name. Friends cautioned me that if I had not seen the movie the musical would not make sense. It did but it also prompted me to rent the movie. At first I thought it was a train wreck full of strange shrieking characters and it was exceedingly hard to watch. But being able to stop it digest it and go back to it made me realize why Grey Gardens is considered to be a memorable documentary. Both Big Edie and Little Edie are unforgettable and their utter lack of self-consciousness is worth witnessing. Both of them remain beautiful despite their encroaching age. They have a relationship that will chill any woman (and undoubtedly some men) and make you re- examine your own dealings with your mother. In an era when reality television and cinema is commonplace it's fascinating to see the Mayleses' work from three decades ago and realize what an impact the film must have had. I echo what other posters have said: how were they allowed to slip into such squalor by their family? But beyond that how could two people living in the 1970s be able to escape reality in such a complete fashion? Or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped? I would highly recommend watching this with the commentary track which gave me additional insight into the film. 
 We really enjoyed Grey Owl: a simple tale well told in classic Attenborough fashion: a little over-romanticized with archetypes humor and a stress of dignity and values. Beautifully shot and told at a nice pace this is the true story of Archie an Englishman who turned native Indian and went to live and trap in Canada. Solid performances from all makes this film with a message easy viewing. Two of the stars of the film are without a doubt the cutest we have ever seen - and the message is a good one with its ecoleanings. It must have been great to meet or read Grey Owl in the 1930s a unique character and this is a fitting film tribute. 
 Robert Standish's novel is about a triangular romantic situation on a Ceylonese tea plantation... So the events of the Ceylon backgrounds and pictorial beauty are rewarding points to William Dieterle's film... The story is about a rich powerful planter (Peter Finch) who brings a charming and tender beauty (Elizabeth Taylor) into the jungle as his bride... The plantation of course is endangered by some kind of wild life... For this reason Taylor ? elegant as never in dazzling costumes ? finds herself in a strange atmosphere... The echo determination of a ghost the bad temper of a husband obsessed by the memory of his autocratic father a highly dangerous disease and the fury of wild animals... In her confusion boredom and annoyance Elizabeth Taylor looks to a friendly face a pretentious foreman (Dana Andrews) who admires her beauty but tries to conquer her love... With echoes of Jane Eyre the mysterious Yorkshire mansion with a brooding master and Rebecca the innocent young second wife hunted by the image of the glamorous first wife Elephant Walk is a menace melodrama with a wide view of a huge tropical bungalow exotic dances with rage excessively colorful stampeding big bull elephants amazing mansion set on fire all in the company of an exquisite creature with an unquestioned beauty and talent... The movie gave Liz a change of scenery and allowed her more creative energy and self-respect than most of her other willful debutante-rebels? The wife here has a sharp tongue and a strong will and so Taylor plays her movie star heroine with more spirit than she was given credit for? 
 Kenny Doughty as Jed Willis is sexier in this role than any male porn star even though he keeps his pants on. The movie tore at my heart reminding me of the intensity of the big explosive love of my life. I don't think I can think of another movie except perhaps Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet that captures that giddy joy that well. The other draw of the movie is the very English eccentric characters enjoying the scandal vicariously. In that sense it is much the same appeal as Midsomer Murder or a Miss Marple mystery without the mayhem. This is a great antidote to the mock horror currently popular in the USA an any relationships between people of different ages. 
 Cypher is a movie well worth seeing because it's not the run-of-the-mill Sci-Fi flick. The artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what's going on. The close-up camera view is how the director keeps the plot illusive. The sci-fi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie. The technology used in the movie isn't overly impressive however the director makes good use of the props. The character development is intentionally shallow. The main character Jeremy Northam decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage. It's up to the audience to figure out his enigmatic character and it's the enigma that keeps the audience interested right to the very end. 
 The only reason I wanted to see this was because of Orlando Bloom. Simply put the movie was spectacularly average. It's not bad but it's really not very good. The editing is good; the film is well-paced. The direction is competent and assured. The story is plodding. The film is averagely acted by Ledger Bloom and the normally great Watts and Rush. The accents are impenetrable if you're from the US so just sit back and enjoy the scenery (or as I like to call it Orlando Bloom). By the end of the film I was neither bored nor moved. Some people have asked what happened to Ned Kelly at the end of the movie. I have to say I so did not care by that point. Really the only reason I can recommend this is that Orlando Bloom kind of sort of shows some hints of range (although the oft-present I'm pretty and confused look is prominent) so fangirls may find it worth the matinee price. Other than that just don't see it. It's neither good enough nor bad enough to be entertaining. 
 A favourite of mine this movie tells of two feuding New York characters Steve Brodie(Raft) and Chuck Connors(Beery) who both strive to be the Main Guy in the Bowery in the late Nineteenth Century. Brodie(1863-1901) and Connors(1852-1913) were real people though this is a heavily fictionalized account of their antics(based on a play).Brodie's legendary(did he do it?- it's still a cause of argument!) jump from the Brooklyn bridge(1886) for which he became famous is shown here as happening around the same time as the Spanish-American war(1898).Director Walsh clearly had a great affection for the period so beautifully recreated here and it includes a wild rumbustious ragtime number from saloon singer Trixie Odbray(a young Pert Kelton).Raft is at his slickest as Brodie and Beery shows again what a clever actor he was as tough big hearted and at times quite touching Connors.Pretty Fay Wray is the love interest both the boys are pursuing. Full of life and energy The Bowery moves at a fast pace(unlike many early talkies ).It is not an easy movie to find but is well worth looking out for. 
 I thought this was an utterly charming film. The story seems to be a thinly veiled autobiography of John Waters: Pecker's greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places. Edward Furlong does well in the lead but the best performances are by his grandmother Mink Stole (a hilarious cameo) and of all people Patty Hearst. I think the reviewers are way off base on this one. They seem to be taking Pecker's worst valuation of his work as gospel when I think the film pretty clearly states that he is indeed a promising artist. 
 Great great great! That is all I can say about that movie but imdb want at least four lines of text so I'll elaborate. The cast was great (Jerry O'connel is soooo cute!) the music was great (The sixties had the best music ever imho) the historical material was interesting and so was the way they made the actors of the '90s seem like they were actually there in the '60s. And most of all - the stories of the main characters brought tears to my eyes and that is the greatness of any drama. BUT IN ONE WORD: GREAT! 
 What can i say about this movie? I have seen it quite a few times since the first time when i was around 6. I have seen the english version and it is done very well. It is a great movie for all ages but it is directed more for children. I love the childlike humor and appreciate it. If you have not seen it you should try to rent a copy you will not be disappointed! 
 Cut is a full-tilt spoof of the slasher genre and in the main it achieves what it sets out to do. Most of the standard slasher cliches are there; the old creepy house the woods the anonymous indestructible serial killer buckets of gore and of course the couple interrupted by the killer while they're having sex (that's hardly a spoiler). The set-up is simplicity itself: film-school nerds set out to complete an unfinished slasher masterpiece unfinished because of the murders of a couple of the cast. This also neatly - okay messily - disposes of Kylie Minogue in the first reel. They are joined by one of the survivors of the original film played by Molly Ringwald who absolutely steals the film because she gets all the best lines. The rest of the cast fit their roles well especially the lovely Jessica Napier who plays it straight while the mayhem and gore erupt around her. There are plenty of red herrings and fake suspenseful moments and there is very little time to try to work out who the killer is because the film moves at such a fast pace. It also has an appropriate low budget look including some clumsy editing which is probably deliberate. Good soundtrack too. If there is a difficulty with this film it is deciding whether it is a send-up of or a homage to the slasher genre. Probably a bit of both. 
 Samuel Fuller's Pickup on South Street is anomalous: A Red Scare movie devoid of hysteria in which the Communist threat is nothing more than the McGuffin that ignites the plot. Pickpocket Richard Widmark relieves loose woman Jean Peters of her wallet containing a strip of microfilm; unbeknownst to either of them it harbors secrets vital to the Cold War. Peters as it happens was under surveillance by FBI agents who are as nonplussed by the theft as the man who's running her cowardly comsymp Richard Kiley. In trying to retrieve the precious film both sides enlist the help of Thelma Ritter a streetwise old jane who's always on the earie and willing to sell what she hears. Fuller draws from an opulent palette of tempos and tonalities in telling the story which becomes a race against the clock of escalating brutality. From the subways to the waterfront his midsummer Manhattan takes on a sweaty sheen that's almost pungent. The love scenes between Peters and Widmark become an unstable mixture of the tumultuous and the tender and they're scored to Again a song introduced by Ida Lupino in Road House also starring Widmark. The pace slackens for Ritter's beautifully written and played death scene -- among the most poignant vignettes in all noir and a kind of mirage-oasis in a film parched of sentimentality. This is writer/director Fuller's only work in the strictest confines of the noir cycle; his later explorations of American pathology (The Crimson Kimono The Naked Kiss Underworld U.S.A.) never resulted in a synthesis as satisfying as Pickup on South Street. 
 Possibly the most brilliant thing about Che: Part Two as we begin to integrate it with Part One in our minds is that there is no clarification of why Che chose to confidentially abscond from Cuba after the revolution no allusion to his experience in the Congo no clarification of why he chose Bolivia as his subsequent setting for a coup d'etat no allusion to the political decisions he made as a young man motorcycling across South America which Walter Salles has given prominent familiarity. Extraordinary focus is given to Che meeting the volunteers who accompany his guerrilla factions. Yet hardly any endeavor is made to single them out as individuals to establish involved relationships. He is reasonably unreasonable. Che drives an unbreakable doctrine to leave no wounded man behind. But there is no feeling that he is deeply directly concerned with his men. It is the concept. In Part 1 in Cuba the rebels are welcomed by the people of the villages given food and cover supported in what grows to be a victorious revolution. Here in Bolivia not much understanding is apparent. Villagers expose him. They protect government troops not his own. When he expounds on the onesidedness of the government medical system his audience appears uninterested. You cannot lead a people into revolution if they do not want to comply. Soderbergh shows U.S. military advisers working with the Bolivians but doesn't fault the United States for Che's collapse. Che seems to have just misfigured his fight and the place where he wanted to have it. In showcasing both wars Soderbergh doesn't build his battle scenes as actions with specific results. Che's men attack and are attacked. They exchange fire with faraway assailants. There is generally a cut to the group in the aftershock of combat its death toll not paused for. This is not a war movie. It is about one man's reasonably unreasonable drive to endure. There is no elaborate cinematography. Soderbergh looks firmly at Che's inflexible dedication. There are remarkable sporadic visceral shots but being few they are all the more powerful such as Che's POV shot during his final beats. There is an abundance of the terrain where these men live for weeks at a time and the all-consuming effect is of languor Guevara himself having malaria part of the time. Benicio Del Toro one of the film's producers gives a champion's performance not least because it's modest. He isn't portrayed as the cutting edge like most epic heroes. In Cuba he arises in conquest in Bolivia he falls to the reverse and occasionally is actually difficult to distinguish behind a tangle of beard and hair. Del Toro illustrates not so much an identity as an attitude. You may think the film is too long. I think there's a genuine cause for its breadth. Guevara's affairs in Cuba and particularly Bolivia was not a sequence of episodes and sketches but an undertaking of staying power that might virtually be called insane. In the end Che as a whole or in parts is a commercially ballsy movie one where its director begins by understanding the limits innate in cinematic biography and working progressively within those means. 
 I'm not sure under what circumstances director Visconti decided to film James Cain's novel The Postman Always Rings Twice (I'm not even sure if Viscounti acquired the book's rights) but the resulting movie is definitely interesting. It is not the best version of Cain's story (I like the 1981 version best) but thanks to Visconti's excellent direction and the casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very sensual couple) it is a must for noir fans. Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to great effect. The film is not perfect though. My main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good; the story moves at a very slow pace (I don't think Visconti was very good at editing his films). I think film noir works better with a short running time. Fortunately Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors that keep the viewer interested. Anyhow as much as I like this film and the remakes I think no one has made the definitive version of Cain's much-praised book. 
 This is what makes me proud to be British. This is by far the funniest thing on TV. The league consists of Jeremy dyson Steve pemberton mark gatiss and the lovely Reece shearsmith. Totally underrated this horror-comedy is perfection. The characters are iconic and the catchphrases bizarre Hello Dave . It is a comedy that everyone simply must watch. The best thing about the league of gentlemen is that it is always fresh and always pushing the boundaries. It does not need to rely on catchphrases(unlike little Britain) for it to be funny. the fact that the league are willing to kill off arguably their most famous and iconic characters shows us that they've got balls of steel. 
 So you think a talking parrot is not your cup of tea huh? Well think again. Paulie is a wonderful film filled with touching moments.The characters are all lovable especially Paulie as he enters the lives of many people on his journey.It is journey worth experiencing. Don't miss it! It is available on home video. 
 Since Douglas MacArthur affected more human lives?for the better?than any other American not elected President he deserved a better film biography. Not that Universal's MacArthur is bad. It's just not all it should have been. Oddly enough the potential was there. From the very early Star Trek episode The Corbomite Maneuver (1966) to the recent HBO films Something the Lord Made (2OO4) and Warm Springs (2OO5) director Joseph Sargent has emerged as one of the most expressively human directors in film a man capable of subtly shaping the emotional shadings of his actors' performances and carrying the audience exactly where he wants them to go. The producer Frank McCarthy also gave us Patton (197O) the legendary Jerry Goldsmith scored both films and Universal widely touted the fact that the film was four years in preparation and production. Yet for all of this MacArthur is perfectly adequate?and not much more than that. The film begins in early 1942 shortly before the beleaguered general was ordered?by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Dan O'Herlihy)?to flee the Philippines to avoid capture by the Japanese. Thus this film omits: ¡¤ MacArthur's birth in 188O in a frontier barracks in Arkansas still subject to attack by Native American tribesmen?thus establishing that his remarkable life spanned the distance from bows-and-arrows to thermonuclear weapons; ¡¤ his graduation from West Point?first in a class of 95 ¡¤ how he joined his famous father General Arthur MacArthur (who had earned the Medal of Honor at Missionary Ridge in the Civil War) on assignments in Japan China and most importantly in the Philippines; ¡¤ his heroic exploits in the 1914 excursion into Vera Cruz; ¡¤ how he leaped about the trenches of World War One like a mountain goat often wounded and promoted with blinding speed to Brigadier General; ¡¤ his postwar service as West Point's youngest?and most progressive?commandant; ¡¤ his participation in the court-martial of Billy Mitchell in 1924; ¡¤ his routing of the Bonus Marchers in 1932; ¡¤ his efforts to sustain a woefully-underfunded Army as Chief of Staff in the early 193O's; ¡¤ his retirement from the U.S. Army to become Field Marshal (!) of the Army of the Philippines; ¡¤ and the reactivation of his commission by FDR shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War. All this is omitted in favor of prolonged footage of MacArthur trying to fight off seasickness while being evacuated by PT boat?thus we know that General Mac is a legend but not why; nor can we appreciate why the allegations of cowardice were so wounding to Dugout Doug ?and so patently unfounded. The remainder of his career is presently straightforwardly: His island-hopping Hit 'em where they ain't campaign the fulfillment of his pledge to the Filipinos? I shall return! ?his crowning achievement the winning of the peace in postwar Japan then the difference of opinion with President Harry Truman (a properly feisty Ed Flanders) over the conduct of the Korean conflict which resulted in his outright firing and finally his proclamation to Congress that old soldiers?simply fade away after which he did just that. All quite historically accurate and all presented with a very deliberate lack of commentary. Sargent and the producers almost painfully distance themselves from adorning the historical record with their own approval or disapproval: If MacArthur's actions appear noble let them be presented as such; if they appear egotistical or bombastic let those conceptions register sans comment. Since Joe Sargent is quite expert at subtly manipulating his audience's reactions?again see Warm Springs?this refusal to offer comment appears quite intentional. Historically that may be commendable but it almost defeats the efforts of the viewer to place this extraordinary man in any kind of rational perspective. And finally there is a sort of made on the cheap feel to the film as there is to Midway released about the same time. Both films were relegated to television directors--Sargent in this case Jack Smight on Midway and both have a made-for-TV-look. Even Jerry Goldsmith's march while perfectly serviceable lack the subtle undertones and the grandeur of his Patton theme--just another way in which a larger-than-life man is memorialized by a very ordinary film. There was vanity and pettiness in this man inarguably; there was also greatness?and love him or loathe him one must acknowledge the fact that MacArthur did what no military commander before him had done: he won the peace. In the end MacArthur ?like so many film biographies?is a good place to begin research into this remarkable man but a poor place to end it. 
 The first of the Tarzan movies staring Johnny Weissmuller. The plot has already been summarized so i wont go into it again. Just know that The actors who play Jane and Tarzan were born for the role. If you have not seen this film and you only have the modern day Tarzan films as a reference..you are missing a Real treat. Doesn't matter how far we've come in movie making makeup set designs...no one will ever play Tarzan as well as Johnny Weissmuller did. He was and is Tarzan. 
 Very interesting. The big twist wasn't as big a shock as maybe they had hoped for and it was very dated but it did get my mind working. It really got me thinking about a world without vegetation or livestock and made me appreciate the world I live in a lot more. Charlton Heston does a good job as do all the supporting characters and it was a very realistic film which was surprising. It lacked direction at times and a lot of the settings and background needed more explanation but it was still a surprisingly good and intelligent movie. The main fault that I could find was that I didn't want the film to end when it did I would have liked to see what happened next. 7/10 
 Brown of Harvard is a hard movie to pin down. We expect a lot more from our movies these days so it helps to remember that audiences in the 20's were a bit more innocent. William Haines is charming as the rogue who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and even glory. All of the relationships in the movie feel very stilted EXCEPT for the homoerotic tie between Billy and Jack Pickford the town nerd. The movie has everything romance tears love death and even sports... It's a great education in how society has changed in the 20th century. 
 Yes as unbelievable as it may be in 1968 a musical won the Academy Award for best picture - and it was the third musical to win that award in a five-year period the first being My Fair Lady in 1964 and then The Sound of Music in 1965. The difference between My Fair Lady The Sound of Music and Oliver! however is that Oliver! is immeasurably better! No comparison. The first two movies are insipid wet noodles compared to the remarkably robust Oliver!. The acting is great; the songs are great; the story is great and the dancing is great. This movie is dynamic topical relevant to the human experience and unlike the overblown Gangs of New York Oliver! offers a portrayal of poverty in 19th century London England that evokes sympathy without being condescending. Oliver Reed was a great actor and he proves it in Oliver! The other actors and actresses especially Ron Moody and Shani Wallis are equally wonderful and offer powerful portrayals of characters who evoke sympathy and warmth without being caricatures. 
 A Classic is something that everybody wants to have read but nobody wants to read. A classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read. -Mark Twain 'Classic' seems to be the word used to describe Scarface Brian DePalma's 1983 film about opulence self surrender greed and danger among Florida's drug ring. People and critics (and rappers for that matter) deem this film 'an epic gangster classic' or 'eptiome of gangster films.' When it is anything but. It is praised for all the wrong reasons. Scarface is a terrific film that deserves praise from all over but not all the praise it gets from audiences today and therefor the fine points it so poignantly makes are missed by the general public. First off the film is about a Cuban refugee with a past of wanting to escape communism grasp and find happiness. Simple? Yes. But the layers of De Palma's directing genius and the great story written by Oliver Stone (yes I know he actually wrote a real good one here) play into all of it. The characters are all looking for an escape as escape is a natural element dealt with in the film by all. Each character has something to offer that makes them likable by everyone who could appreciate this film. They are entwined in a world of mystique and money but all that has a price as they all learn. Each character thinks they are getting better chances in life when in true dramatic irony they are actually getting worse. 'Tragedy' would be a better word to describe this movie. All those who praise the film for it's drug usage it's violence it's dialog totally missed the point. There is nothing really positive about the film besides the characters positive expectations of themselves. And that is why the film works so well. The devastation through out the film serves to deliver the message of the film not to look cool or attract viewers. Brian De Palma doesn't make movies for cult gangsters or brainless action fans. Next on the film is an adult drama. It is not a 'gangster film'. It has it's share of action but the action is plotted very carefully so it has a point. It's not like Aliens - an example of a big dumb action film and most audiences perceive this film as a big dumb action gangster film about doing drugs and shooting people. Ridiculous. Hogwash. If this film is about that then it is about how bad it is. Not a promotion of it. This being said the film is indeed a great film. It has great cinematography that pulls you into the story. It has a very dramatic score (in true Giorgio Moroder style) which simply could give you chills or bring you to tears. The film is rather lengthy but it is a story and each moment counts. The acting is terrific. Al Pacino - enough said. He can do any role that he puts his mind to and this was no exception. Pretty boy Steven Bauer as Manny. I didn't think much of him in other films he did but he actually makes you like him when he goes under maestro De Palma's direction. Michelle Pfeiffer is a true gem as Elvira. Popping' fresh off the heels of a sort of embarrassment in Grease 2 she got her ticket to ride performing a no holds barred performance of a beauty that is more than meets the eye. But the three true diamonds in this rough are Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio as Tony's sister Gina who when she smiles or cries we see her soul and her fresh way of living and watch it deteriorate; Paul Shenar as Alejandro Sosa a drug lord who runs deeper than a river and Shenar portrays him as so; and Miriam Colom as Tony and Gina's torn mother. These three dig the film as deep as it can go. This reviewer learned one main thing when watching Scarface for the first time. Always go into a film unsuspecting. All the hype and talk of this film cannot possibly prepare you for what you really see. Only knowing De Palma (like I do) can give you even a glimpse of what this film holds. So ignore the rap crap ignore the mindless violence supporters and fix yourself a glass of Bailey's on the rocks and indulge yourself in an emotional viewing of a great film the real Scarface.  
 You like to solve mysteries? You like complex narrations? This is for you. Brilliant clever movie by Francis Leclerc(son of a legendary french Canadian signer Felix Leclerc). Flashy photo and clever editing is the word of Leclerc strongly helped by Roy Dupuis who's dythirambic in the lead role. The plot is about Alexandre Tourneur veterinary in his 40's who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by somebody unknown. Tourneur is struggling to remember who hit him as he was ending a deer's sufferings on the road. Throughout the struggling he has weird behavior and it seems like something took over him. Not spooky but very mysterious and well played movie. I have my hypothesis on the ending(I think the Indian caused the accident) but this ending was open to any explanations. I strongly recommend it 9.5/10 
 The 60¡äs is a well balanced mini series between historical facts and a good plot. In four deliveries we follow a north American family with 3 members. But we don't only see them. We also follow the story of several characters as a black reverend an extremist student leader and a soldier in Vietnam. The filmography is just extraordinary. In the first chapters we see some shots of the Vietnam war in between the scenes. The next chapter doesn't start where the last one finished it starts some time after giving us a little mystery on what happened. In general The 60¡äs mini series is a must see not only for hippies fanatics but for everyone with little curiosity about the topic. 
 I first saw this film when i was around 6 or 7 years old and didn't really think it was anything particularly special. AS time went on i watched it a few more times and it started to grow on me as i started to understand the morals of the film which i will come to later. For a while i left this film alone and didn't watch it for a while. When looking for an old classic film to watch a few weeks ago (now being 15) I dug out the VHS of homeward bound. After watching this i was left on a natural high that i couldn't really explain. The film gives an overwhelming sense of joy that you never really expect. The films nature of three completely different animals collaborating together to find their way home really sends a message home that no matter how different you are you can always find common ground something that you all need. The way the personalities of the characters is chosen is truly fantastic. In that you have an old knowledgeable wise golden retriever looking after or guiding 'chance' the fun loving if slightly clumsy young American bulldog with sassy the clever vulnerable but confident cat. The film follows these three friends or companions on a journey that is so realistically impossible it creates magic in that you start to believe that this journey can happen. I don't want to sound like a soft tissue grabber when it comes to films i assure you i am quite the opposite but the most uplifting part of this film is without a doubt shadows return when shadow desperately tries to escape and chance and sassy painfully are told by him to leave. When both animals return to their beloved owners there is a silence until shadow limps over the horizon to the awe of all. There is a fine line between heartwarming and corny rubbish but this film is pure magic even at the age of 15. This film may not be Lord of the rings but for Disney to produce such a fantastic film using animals and for it to uplift myself in the way it does even at this age it deserves 10/10. 
 A true story about a true revolution 25 of April ; a revolution against a repressive regime of 41 years that was imposing a colonial war on it's military's for maintaining an empire (Angola Mozambique Guine-Bissau Cabo Verde S. Tom¨¦ e Principe; the first and the last of the great colonial empire's of Europe) of 600 years since it's beginning in the conquest of Ceuta in 1415; a revolution by the army for the people and for a democratic Portugal; the most's surprising fact in this revolution is that it were no people killed in it (except those that died in the hand's of PIDE the political police of the State during a brutal gunfire against an unarmed crowd protesting in front of it's headquarters in the day of the revolution in 25 of April 1974 has it show's on the film).And has all revolutions it has it's heroes one them of was Captain Salgueiro Maia a returned soldier from the war whose convictions along with the rest of the army was that they were fighting (since 1961) a hopeless war and that sometimes a soldier has to disobey it's country. 
 Fair drama/love story movie that focuses on the lives of blue collar people finding new life thru new love.The acting here is good but the film fails in cinematography screenplay directing and editing.The story/script is only average at best.This film will be enjoyed by Fonda and De Niro fans and by people who love middle age love stories where in the coartship is on a more wiser and cautious level.It would also be interesting for people who are interested on the subject matter regarding illiteracy....... 
 Based on a true story this series is a gem within its kind. The slave that becomes queen by capturing the heart of the most powerful man in the village. In the diamond mining town of Tijuco in Brazil the diamond commender--appointed by the king of Portugal--is the ultimate authority. Having grown up in the relative security of his house the young and beautiful Xica da Silva finds her world threatened when he decides to sell her to a whorehouse in town refusing to recognize that a black slave girl could be his daughter. In a desperate bid to save herself Xica steals the diamonds collected by the diamond commender for the king intending to use them to escape. The king's army arrives to collect the diamonds the very next day however and when the loot turns up missing the diamond commender is led away in chains his family dispossessed and thrown out in the street with only the clothes on their backs. Martin the diamond commender's son swears vengeance. Xica and the other slaves however are sold at auction and Xica ends up in the home of the Sergeant Major an old man who bought her solely to slake his lust. To the town of Tijuco however comes the new diamond commender the elegant and ruthless Joao Fernandes. Immediately struck by Xica's beauty he manipulates the Sergeant Major into selling her to him. And thus begins a love story filled with danger intrigue and passion between a willful nobleman and a crafty slave girl who rises to one day become queen. The series is filled with rich details of the era's beliefs superstitions politics fashion etc. etc. And it really manages to captivate your attention for every minute. At times funny with a sarcastic and dark humor full of suspense and unexpected twists. Xica da Silva is definitely a must. I wish I could buy the whole series on DVD. 
 This movie has taken a lot of stick. It was slated by critics when it came out and was blamed for wrecking Nicolas Cage's career. The thing I don't think people get is that it's not meant to be an epic Oscar contender of a movie it's just some brilliant Bruck-buster action at its best. Fast cars quick editing and a great soundtrack - it does exactly what it says on the tin. Also for anyone who likes cars its a pure treat. It has everything: Ferraris Mercs a Hummer and lets not forget Eleanor! I think you'd be hard pushed to find a better action movie and personally a better movie at all!! Then again maybe that's just me! 
 Hidden Frontier is notable for being the longest running internet-based Star Trek fan series. While the production quality is not on a par with fan productions like Starship Exeter or New Voyages Hidden Frontier concentrates largely on story and in that regard it does very well indeed. Hidden Frontier has no physical sets; instead actors are filmed against a greenscreen and the backgrounds inserted digitally. One of Hidden Frontier's greatest achievements is the sheer volume of work they have produced. One of the ways in which this is achieved is by inserting the virtual sets at the time of filming instead of in post-production. While this does save a great deal of time it's also worth noting that the quality of the resultant footage is not as high as if it had been produced in post-production though it still serves its purpose. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea Hidden Frontier is well worth a shot though you might be best to start off watching the third season since this is where the producers really start to hit their stride. 
 A very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between. As a child of divorced parents I was totally relating to events in the film. Also - a really cool zombie twist which I thought was VERY ORIGINAL. I'm tired of the same old stuff in movies.

 La Maman et la putain is the beautifulest film of all time. And what's most moving about it may be the relation between reality and art the movie deals with which is directly inspired by Proust's A la Recherche du temps perdu . Indeed La Maman et la putain and In search of lost time apparently tell the same story : the one of the failure of love which repeats itself endlessly. The first woman's name is always Gilberte and the second woman appears like a twisted and deformed double of Gilberte : Veronika is like a whore Gilberte beautiful like the night whereas Gilberte was pure and beautiful like the day . After the failure of the first love a second love begins but this one is like already doomed by the first one. Veronika takes the place of Gilberte in Alexandre's life and in the movie. She progressively eclipses her first by time to time Gilberte's still coming when Alexandre waits for Veronika then totally. That shows it's the same sad story repeating itself the same unfaithful woman like Alexandre says who appears endlessly - and unfaithful is for Proust the higher point in love which makes it exist but which also underlines its illusions. Art is what causes the passage between what's outside - the illusion of love - to what's inside which is the truth and is a learning of this truth. For instance when Veronika notices the strange way Alexandre makes is bed he answers that he saw it in a movie and then that a movie it's made for that to learn how to live how to make a bed . Alexander wants to live like he was in a film he wants his life to be art. This conception of art comes from Proust with whom Eustache shares the same rejection of political art and realism in art. La Maman et la putain fights against a conception of art principaly political - see for example the ironical review of a political movie by Alexandre. Like Proust says : Art doesn't care for all this proclamations and only exists in silence. First of all art is introspection. And that also why realism or naturalism is rejected : art needs to transform reality to exist. Proust writes : I discover the illusion of realism which is a lie . That's why La Maman et la putain doesn't hide its artificiality underlines by the way the actors say their text : the more you seem artificial the higher you go said Eustache. Eustache and Proust both share this idea that the artist is a translater of a inner truth. But Alexandre failed where Eustache succeed. La Maman et la putain tells us the failure of a character to be what he truly is. You can sens the tragedy arise when you go further in the movie which becomes saddest. You can see it in the face of Alexandre who looks more and more like a living-dead. You can see it by the fact that the scenes become longer and that after a while nothing happens outside. At the end of the movie when you see Alexandre writing and Veronika asking if he's writing his life you can guess that he's not that even literature failed. The end of the movie shows the symbolic death of Alexander who is smashes by the heaviness of reality. And in this tiny nurse's room Alexandre looks more like Albertine than Marcel. To explain this failure we can say that Alexandre is a Balzac's reader. In Forme et signification Jean Rousset explains that in Proust's the readers of Balzac who are Swann and Charlus are unable of any artistic creation because they're stuck in reality which they mistake with art. They see reality in art and are not aware of the transformations that necessarily exist between the life of an artist and his work between reality and art . And that's exactly Alexandre. He claims for instance that he loves a woman for parallel reasons because she played in a Bresson's for example . He's like Swann who falls in love with Odette because she looks like a Botticelli's woman. Life is perhaps not my vocation . This thought is indeed by Eustache who committed suicide even if it's said by Alexandre. Nevertheless there is a difference between Alexandre and Eustache : if Eustache is absolutely Alexandre Alexandre is like a double without art a horrible vision of the artist which crystallizes his fears. By fallowing Veronika at the end of the movie Alexandre is condemned to illusions. It's death that remind me the last frames of the movie in the face of Jean-Pierre L¨¦aud as well as in the endless pucking of Veronika. Or maybe it is already hell that describes the end like in Sarte's Huit-Clot and absolutely not like in the final liberation of Le Temps retrouv¨¦ . If Eustache had read Proust Alexandre could never have finish the book always perturbed by life and Veronika when he tries to read it at his apartment or in the caf¨¦s. La Maman et la Putain is like a inverse double of In search of lost times which tells how Alexander doesn't become an artist whereas A la Recherche du temps perdu tells how Marcel becomes a writer (Genette). If like Baudelaire says an artiste tells reality at the light of his dream it is his nightmare that Eustache tells us in La Maman et la putain . 
 I enjoy movies like this for their spirit no pun intended. Its a decent clean movie about a baseball team that's falling behind and a young fan wishes for them to win since his deadbeat dad said that was the only way he'd come back for him. The spirit shines through in two ways: A funny cast with Danny Glover and a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt and the heavenly herald Al taking the dynamic form of Christopher Lloyd. Its an energetic movie. It gets you smiling and really involves you in the sport. Therein lies my gripe. the one thing that kinda bugs me is these sports movies that kind of turn you into an unexpecting fan for the team. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that. I just find it odd that I should come away from the movie thinking the Angels are a strong cool team when really my base loyalty such as it is lies with the Toronto Blue Jays. It's interesting really. If it's just a movie about an underdog kids team then its okay. 
 It's been quite some time since I've watched this LOTR. I am currently hunting for a copy to purchase. Bakshi's work is quite true to the original work. The visuals are engrosing and sometimes haunting. Drawbacks? Occasionally the movie is confusing or muddled. There are one or two times where the storyline slows to a crawl. But overall -- buy this movie. It's great for kids adults and collectors. 
 Bell Book and Candle was shown recently on cable. Not having seen it for a while we decided to take another look at this comedy. Based on the James Van Druten's Broadway hit which was a vehicle for Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer in the early fifties the film was adapted for the screen by Daniel Taradash. The film was directed by Richard Quine who turned the play into a delightful comedy. Evidently judging by some of the comments submitted by IMDb the big issue seems to be the pairing of the two stars who had collaborated on Vertigo released the same year. Movie audiences didn't think anything about the age difference when this film was released. In fact most of the aging male stars of that period were always involved with much younger women. The film set in Manhattan during Christmas is a delightful comedy that has enchanted viewers. Kim Novak was at the height of her beauty as it's clear the camera adored her no matter what was she playing. As the witch that becomes human her Gillian is charming. James Stewart who plays the publisher Shep' Henderson is also seen at his best. Mr. Stewart was an excellent comedy actor who shows in here why he was at the top. In supporting roles the wonderful Elsa Lanchester playing Queenie is a welcome addition to any movie as she proves here. Jack Lemmon's Nicky Holroyd the brother of Gillian is also good. Ernie Kovacs is also seen as the writer Sidney Radlitch. This is an excellent way to spend a winter night at home watching Bell Book and Candle . 
 Don't think of this movies as just another kids movie - the whole family can enjoy it. Its a strange mix of a movie as its seems to have a movie within it but at least it does make sense at the end (unlike modern films!) It does give you all the elements of a film (decent plot good characters - well it does star the Muppets a list of lesser celebs* which films would clamour for) What is surprising is the fact that it can be a roller coaster of emotions some sad some heartwarming some funny and some serious - it all makes an enjoyable family film that everyone can watch together. * The celebs in the film are actually top stars of the day but there is only one true star of the film and no one dare outshine Miss Piggy!!!! 
 I first saw this film about 11 years ago when my former college Accounting professor recommended it to me. I was amazed that a movie from 1968 could so coherently and hilariously portray computer crime. Maggie Smith is delightful and Ustinov plays the retro hacker perfectly. O Nolo Mio !!!!! 
 I love Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale looks amazingly immature in her role. The movie is flawed only because it seems the two accused seem to be in some Monastery working like monks in the grass and under strict almost martial-arts-like discipline. The acting and filmography and amazing colors of what is supposed-to-be Thailand is eye-catching but Claire Daines steals the entire movie and is unexpectedly profound in her learning the hard lesson of life itself to the very end in an act of amazing unselfishness unheard of and completely unexpected in the real world. The flaws are minute and I recommend the film which seems buried sadly forever to rare TV showings. I for one want the film for my collection- a collection of only 10 rated films. Watch it you will be very touched. 
 I have read over 100 of the Nancy Drew books and if you are not bright enough to catch on yet Nancy Drew the movie was of a YOUNGER Nancy Drew not the 18-year-old that doesn't go to school that all of the books are about. This was when she was sixteen. So naturally she would of not as been as smart as the one in the book considering she is only in the 10th grade. Other than that I thought the movie was very cute. It was clean and appropriate for everyone. It was funny at times. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job. She was articulate in character and cute. I liked the awkwardness that Nancy and Ned had around each other because they obviously were not old enough to be in a serious relationship like they have in the books. It was a cute PG movie that I throughly enjoyed because I unlike most people my age enjoy movies without sex drugs or profanity. 
 One of Disney's best films that I can enjoy watching often. you may easily guess the outcome but who cares? its just plain fun escape for 1 hour forty-two minutes. and after all wasn't movies meant to get away from reality for just a short time anyway? The cast sparkles with delight. -magictrain 
 THE MAN IN THE MOON is a warm and moving coming of age drama centering around a farming family in the 1950's. The main story follows a 14-year old girl (Reese Witherspoon) who develops a crush on a 17-year old neighbor (Jason London) who ends up falling for her older sister (Emily Warfield) and how an unexpected tragedy alters this family's dynamics forever. The 1950's are lovingly evoked here and the screenplay gives you characters you come to care about almost immediately. Witherspoon already begins to show the Oscar-winning talent she would develop in this early role and London makes a charming leading man. Warfield lends a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister that is effective as well. Kudos to Sam Waterston and Tess Harper who play the girls' parents and Gail Strickland who plays London's mom. I was unexpectedly moved by this quiet and affecting drama that stirs up strong emotions and gives deeper meaning to the phrase family ties.  
 Indian Summer is a warm multi-character film that would make a fine afternoon film (with a bit of editing). The film begins in the past with a group of children being shown a moose which sets the tone perfectly before cutting into the present when a group of adults from the golden age of the camp are invited back again to spend a few weeks holiday by the head of the camp Uncle Lou. The film then allows the viewer to spend time with these characters as they remember their times at the camp and form new memories in their latest stay. The film succeeds in the great way it brings across its characters in this gorgeous setting and allows them room to develop without having to worry about plot developments. Watching these people reminisce and their relationships with each other is what the film is all about and why it works so well. It never goes to over the top and melodramatic always keeping its warmth charm and realism. I've never seen a film where nostalgia is captured so well and found myself getting drawn in despite never having been to one of these camps as a child myself. For a warm nostalgic character movie I sincerely recommend. 
 Have never understood why the MacDonald-Eddy swan song has always been panned so mercilessly--not just by their detractors but by virtually everyone. To me I Married an Angel is more lively and imaginative than any of the duo's more celebrated outings. The sets and costumes are as lavish as any to be found in an MGM musical the script is by the reliable Anita Loos ( San Francisco The Women Gentlemen Prefer Blondes etc.) the Rodgers and Hart tunes (albeit altered a bit by MacDonald-Eddy regulars Bob Wright and Chet Forrest) are given celestial treatment by Herbert Stothart (Oscar-winner for scoring The Wizard of Oz ) and best of all the singing sweethearts look great in their contemporary clothes and seem to be having fun with the bizarre proceedings. Try to show Rose Marie or Sweethearts to the uninitiated today and they may very well have a hard time sitting still but this offbeat fast-paced fantasy is bound to entertain. 
 I really think that people are taking the wrong approach at this one. First of all I find this short-film very entertaining and interesting. I just take it for what it is. I think the suspense and mystery are ingenious in their insinuation upon the watcher. One other thing that caught my fancy was that it immediately gets the viewer involved even though there is no clear story just hints and pauses and emotions played out by the characters that kind of give you the impression that there is a story to all that is going on. No-one else could have done that better than Lynch. This is the essence of lynchianism at its best. Sure I will agree with anyone that people that start viewing this with the desire to be entertained without any really imaginative work from the viewer's side will find themselves disappointed. And in good right. Lynch is not about that. At least this side of Lynch is not. The one that helped make Lost Highway/Mulholland Dr. is at full tilt here and people that just expect to be entertained like they would watching anything else will just not get what this is all about. My opinion is that Darkened Room is all about messing with your animal-core your instinctual self by giving you the means (image sound situation) by which you instinctively react. It's not about pleasure of any kind it's about getting the desired reaction out of you. And that my friend is pure art. 
 I am not a huge fan of camp kitsch and the so bad it's good type of viewing. However I really like this film for its fun factor and - believe it or not - it's innovation. The whole thing has a ring of John Waters and is boundlessly enthusiastic but with some superb actors and considered direction making the most of the slapstick and styalised movements. Billy Zane moves with incredible expression (see the scene on the bus for a text-book lesson in how to use movement) and is framed by some unexpected stars. You may not like this film you may not enjoy it but if you get the chance to watch it then spare the time because chances are you will end the film with a confused smile on your face and a new perspective on the sense of humour of some big stars. Highly reccomended. 
 It does not seem that this movie managed to please a lot of people. First off not many seem to have seen it in the first place (I just bumped into it by accident) and then judging by the reviews and the rating of those that did many did not enjoy it very much. Well I did. I usually tolerate Gere for his looks and his charm and even though I did not consider him a great actor I know he can do crazy pretty well (I liked his Mr Jones). But this performance is all different. He is not pretty in this one and he is not charming. His character is completely different from anything I had seen from him up to that point---old ugly broken determined. And Gere in what to me is so far his best performance ever pulls it off beautifully. I guess it is a sign of how well an actor does his job if you cannot imagine anyone else doing it instead---think Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter or Washington as Alonzo in Training Day. That is how good Gere was here. The rest of the cast were fine by me too. I guess I would not have cast Danes in this role mostly because I think she is too good-looking for it. But she actually does an excellent job holding her own with a Gere in top form which is no small feat. Strickland easily delivers the best supporting act in a part that requires a considerable range from her. I actually think she owns the key scene with Gere and Danes and that is quite an achievement. So what about the rest of the movie apart from some excellent acting? The story is perhaps not hugely surprising some 8mm-ish aspects to it but adding the veteran breaks in rookie storyline to the who-dunnit and also (like Silence of the Lambs) adding a sense of urgency through trying to save the girl and the impending retirement of Gere's character. All that is a backdrop to the development of the two main characters as they help each other settle into their respective new stations in life. That's a lot to accomplish in a 100 minutes but it is done well and we end up caring for the characters and what happens to them. Direction and photography were adequate. I could have done without the modern music-video camera movements and cutting but then I am an old curmudgeon and it really wasn't all that bad in fact I think it did help with the atmosphere of the movie which as you might have guessed by and large isn't a happy one. Worth seeing. 
 Considering all the teen films like the Breakfast Club and Pretty In Pink that are lionized. It is surprising that this one is so ignored. There is no sex in it but sex is thought of including the idea that it may matter what others think about it. The kids do not always get along with their parents but neither the parents or the kids are seen as always right or wrong and the parents are not seen as monsters. It deals with hero-worship. How one girl does a dangerous thing which could have lead to real dustier before realizing that she was wrong. The movie is kind of ahead of its' time. One kid asks another kid what birth control she uses. She says she is doing nothing to need birth control. She replies (wrongly) oral sex . 
 In 1993 with the success of the first season of Batman: The Animated Series Warner Brothers commissioned the team responsible for the hit-show with producing a feature-length movie originally slated for Direct-To-Video but bumped up to theatrical status. It would become known as Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. Ten years after Phantasm we have had an additional three feature-films released from the boys at the WB Sub-Zero Return of the Joker and now Mystery of the Batwoman joins the family. The plot is basic and in many ways similar to Mask of the Phantasm: A new female vigilante modeling herself after Batman has begun targeting operations run by Gotham mob boss Rupert Thorne and Oswald Cobblepot AKA The Penguin. Now Batman must attempt to unravel the mystery of the Batwoman before she crosses the line. The animation is the sleeker futuristic style that was utilized for Batman: The Animated Series' fifth and sixth seasons (AKA The New Batman Adventures). it's quite nicely done and just as sleek as Return of the Joker's animation. There is also some use of CGI but it's minor compared to the overabundance of it in Sub-Zero. The music was alright. Different and exotic and similar to the Justice League score although the points in the score when the old animated Batman theme comes up will be sure to send waves of nostalgia through the older fans' rodent-shaped hearts. Kevin Conroy as always does a wonderful job as Bruce Wayne and Batman. It's also great to have the old Batman: The Animated Series alumni back; that includes Bob Hastings (Commissioner Gordon) Robert Costanzo (Detective Bullock) Tara Strong (Barbara Gordon/Batgirl; her cameo hints at the romantic-relationship between her and Bruce that was mentioned in Batman Beyond) and Efrem Zimbalist Jr.(Alfred). Villains were also great - especially given that Rupert Thorne the old mob boss from the original series appears for the first time since the fourth season. Overall while not quite reaching the standard set by Mask of the Phantasm ten years ago MOTB carries on the torch quite nicely for the animated Batman films. And if you have the DVD and are a hardcore fan you will love the five-minute short Chase Me. 
 I caught Evening in the cinema with a lady friend. Evening is a chick flick with no apologies for being such but I can say with some relief that it's not so infused with estrogen that it's painful for a red-blooded male to watch. Except for a single instance at the very end of the movie I watched with interest and did not have to turn away or roll my eyes at any self-indulgent melodrama. Ladies for their part will absolutely love this movie. Ann Lord is elderly bed-ridden and spending her last few days on Earth as comfortably as possible in her own home with her two grown daughters at her side. Discomfited by the memories of her past Ann suddenly calls out a man's name her daughters have never heard before: Harris. While both of her daughters silently contemplate the significance of their mother's strong urge to recall and redress her ill-fated affair with this mysterious man at this of all times Ann lapses back in her head to the fateful day she met Harris - and in doing so lost the youthful optimism for the future that we all inevitably part ways with. Both Ann and her two daughters - one married with children one a serial commitophobe - struggle with the central question of whether true love really exists and perhaps more importantly if true love can endure the test of time. Are we all one day fated to realize that love never lasts forever? Will we all realize that settling for the imperfect is the only realistic outcome? The subtle fact that the aged Ann is still wrestling with an answer to these questions on her deathbed is not lost on her two daughters. The cinematography for Evening is interesting - most of the film is spent in Ann's mind as she recalls the past and for that reason I think the film was shot as if it was all deliberately overexposed to give everyone an ethereal glow (and thus make it very obvious that all of this is not real but occurred in the past). Claire Danes is beautiful (appearing to be really really tall though just 5' 5 in reality) and is absolutely captivating in one climactic scene where her singing talents are finally put to the test. You can't really talk trash about the cast which leads off with Claire Danes and doesn't let up from there: Vanessa Redgrave Patrick Wilson Meryl Streep and Glenn Close fill out the other major and minor roles in the film. I can't really say anything negative about this film at all though Hugh Dancy's struggle to have his character emerge from utter one-dimensionality is in the end a total loss. Playing the spoiled lovable drunk offspring of the obscenely rich who puts up a front of great bravado but is secretly scared stiff of never amounting to anything probably doesn't offer much in the way of character exploration - he had his orders and stuck to them. In the end gentlemen your lady friend will most certainly weep and while you'll likely not feel nearly as affected the evening will definitely not be a waste for the time spent watching Evening. Catch it in theatres or grab it as a rental to trade off for points for when you want to be accompanied to a viewing of Die Hard 4 or the upcoming Rambo flick. It'll be your little secret that this viewing didn't really cost you much at all. 
 This is an excellent film about the characters in a adult swimming class their problems relationships and interactions with each other. It should have managed a wider distribution as it's much better than similar films from major studios out at the same time. The swimming instructor is an almost-Olympian reduced to teaching adults basic lessons and often the target of horndogging from his female students. He attempts more or less to fend them off with varying results. The students characters are mainstream U.S.A; teachers policemen college students and retired people all of whom haven't learned to swim for some reason. The movie covers their relationships including friends relatives and romantic conquests as they go through the class. Several subplots provide amusing fodder including a teacher going through a divorce some high school students making a documentary and a girl who is only in the class to meet guys. This is a good date movie or just one to watch when you're in the mood for a romantic drama with overtones of reality. 
 The combination of reading the Novella and viewing this film has inspired my wife and I to new levels. Recently I was pondering a statement made by the artist Thomas Kinkade in one of his inspirational books; He states: You and I were not designed to breathe the fetid air of five o'clock traffic. Nor do I think God had banal television programs media hype worthless purchases and soul pollution in mind when he created the universe... I hadn't seen A river runs through it in a couple of years but after pondering Kinkade's statement something drew me to watch the film with a spiritual eye. I watched it and saw a whole new world to the film and it inspired me to read the book (a must read). I have always been frustrated in Southern California but somehow got caught up in its materialistic society. The film really puts into perspective of how we should really experience God's creations. A combination of Macleans story and my desire to move back to the Northwest has driven me to move to Montana. I want my future kids to be able to rome the landscape go fly-fishing with me ride horses into nothing but open land and serene lakes set in the mountainside. A place where you seldom worry about crime. I look around SoCal and all I see is shopping malls rude snarling people in their Mercedez Bens miles of vehicles on congested freeways gangs racial turmoil on the verge of violent eruption and everyone skeptical of each others intentions. Anyway the movie is very inspiring with brilliant acting and a deep story about the fragile connections of loved ones. There is a lot of deep thinking in this film. The scenery is worth seeing alone and actually helps relieve tension. You should finish this film relaxed yet full of insights to your own life. It takes a compassionate intelligent and spiritual person to really grasp the meaning. If you don't understand the art of cinema and how a director achieves his goals through dialogue tone light colour scenery camera angles/movement etc. Then this film is probably not for the crowd that thinks The Fast and the Furious is the greatest film. Granted it was entertaining but shallow. The bottom line: This film helps to realize that life is not about how much money you have or what things you posses. Rather it is about your relationships with family and friends and the experiences you share together. QUALITY NOT QAUNTITY 
 Mr Michael Jackson is an artistic phenomenon. His short movies i.e. music videos are simply the best. I do not care if I get a sane sci-fi feature from this man but I do care to get a medley of his crazy dancing shriek yells cool crowd choreography and some bits of CGI and animation. There also should be a few uninterrupted videos. Everything I've mentioned is here. Stupid plot and over-the-top vanity fair are not a problem when I witness Mr Michael Jackson in action. To me he will always be the ultimate king of music videos (not king of pop which sounds moronic especially for us Russians because pop sounds like the Russian word for arses and MJ is definitely not king of arses ). I can re-watch his best music videos (which are artistically beautiful) and I never get tired of them. My first impression of this film was What is this...? (bits of different videos some drawn images unsettling jumps from one theme to another absence of any cohesive plot line some kids fooling around etc.) but as I watched it till the end I could tell that it was great and really nothing like anything else shown on TV nowadays. What I like here too is that it never shows any shameful material and can be watched by kids easily. Without Mr Michael Jackson the universe of music videos would be rather poor. Even the best classic videos of other artists cannot come very close to the energetic hyperbole of MJ musical insanity and artistic quality. He knew how to get the audience of different ages and he knew how to remain a man with moral principles. When I see a proper DVD release with Mr Michael Jackson videos I know that it deserves to be purchased even if some clips have already appeared in some other previous release. HIStory I HIStory II and Moonwalker are all great though only Moonwalker is more like one movie (with a solid Smooth Criminal theme paparazzi topic and a few weird spoofs and twists). Being no fan of MJ I can still give this film... like no other a solid 9 out of 10 (I've been hit by Smooth Criminal for sure and my major complains are the following: initial segments of the movie could have been dropped while the main MJ anti-drug campaign should have been given more sky-rocketing insanity and stress and there should have been more moonwalking itself of course). Thanks for attention. 
 Picked up the movie at the flea market for 4 bucks sure did get my moneys worth!. Could care-less about the hot babes but the animation just blew me away after a steady diet of Simpsons (Sorry Mr. Groening). The best part facial expressions. Recommend multiple viewings with some cool tunes good friends and a couple of cold ones! 
 A typical romp through Cheech and Chong's reality which includes drugs singing more drugs cars and driving even more drugs Pee Wee aliens gasoline laundry stand up comedy surprisingly more drugs and SPACE COKE !!. It is not as coherent or plausible as Up in Smoke but it still is incredibly funny without becoming as strange as Nice Dreams. There are some classic scenes which include the opening scene where they get some gas for their car and the drive to work. Also funny is Cheech's song (Mexican-Americans) and Chong's follow up song. Another notable scene is the welfare office scene with Jones (human noise machine) from the Police Academy series and the old laughing man. All in all this is a great follow up to Up in Smoke and is quite watchable when sober or not. -Celluloid Rehab 
 I enjoyed this movie so much that I watched it twice and that is something to say about a documentary. The musical score cinematography and sound are absolutely stunning as you might expect from an Imax production. Even though it is shot for those huge Imax theaters it looks and sounds wonderful on my home system. In fact this would make a perfect DVD to demo your system. The subject is also so fascinating. It is about Mario Andretti and his son Michael. I was already a fan of Mario because he is the best racecar drive in history since he is the only person to win the CART Championship F1 Championship The Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500. The script follows the path of two cars very important to the father and son. The first car is found in a chicken coop and turns out to be the first roadster that Mario ever drove and we follow restoration to gleaming perfection. The other car is Michael's new racecar and we follow it from cutting the mold through the race season. Imax lends just the right magic to make car construction entertaining and fascinating. Paul Newman who was Michael Amoretti's team owner at the time this movie was made narrates the film. His anecdotes and witticism drawn from many years as an owner and driver lends much to the production. The main feature is the race scenes. Turn up the volume here! There is something about riding along at over 200 mph and the musical score that totally draws you into the screen for an experience you will not forget. Wow! The final magical element is the humanity of the Andretti family. This god of the racing world Mario Andretti is loving father who proudly watches over his son's career. They work together so well that every father and son should see this. You can tell that they are a close family. I wish we could all have that experience. 
 Across the country and especially in the political landscape people with any kind of political ambition should take time out to see this film. The movie is called City Hall and with little imagination its synopsis can take place anywhere in America. It just so happens to open in New York. Here we have the story of a popular politician named Mayor John Pappas (Al Pacino) with enough savvy to run a major metropolitan city with very little effort. His right-hand man is none other than Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack) an equally bright individual who's ambitions are tied to his mentor and both seemed destined for higher office. Everything points in that direction until a police shooting ignites an investigation spearheaded by Marybeth Cogan (Bridget Fonda) who believes the guilt points towards city hall and the mayor. A six year old boy and a police officer's death are blamed on a career criminal who's questionable freedom leads to an apparent cover-up by political pay-offs and city corruption involving union leaders like Danny Aiello played by Frank Anselmo corrupt judicial officials like Judge Walter Stern. (Martin Landau) and mafia bosses like Paul Zapatti (Anthony Franciosa) who are deeply involved. Also implicated are party officials like Larry Schwartz (Richard Schiff) who works for the probation office of New York. But it is the bond between the mayor and his deputy which is taken to task by the accidental shooting. A great vehicle for Cusack and a sure bet nominee to become a classic. **** 
 The wit and pace and three show stopping Busby Berkley numbers put this ahead of the over-rated 42nd Street. This is the definitive 30's musical with a knockout frenetic performance from Jimmy Cagney. One of the last releases before the Motion Picture Production Code was strictly enforced. A must see. 
 There are some comments about this film that say that it is a bad and silly one and such an excellent actor as Pierre Fresnay should not have accepted to act in it. I think just the opposite that even when the film is strange and has some weaknesses the performance of Pierre Fresnay is so formidable that it converts the film in something excellent. His performance is probably the best in history. The film itself has a very polemic scene about the consecration of wine in the cabaret. For somebody who does not believe that a priest ? even a defrocked one ? can convert it in Christ's blood the scene is perhaps bizarre. But for somebody who has been raised in a catholic framework it is very emotive even if quite unpleasant. The scene of the death of the younger priest is tremendously shocking. But it is very well acted. Pierre Fresnay turns the crazy act of murder in something understandable within the temporal madness of his character the tortured defrocked Morand who in this terrible way comes back to his duty. 
 Paperhouse is the most moving and poignant film I've ever seen. Often classed as a horror movie this I believe is a grave error. Some journo once called it the thinking person's Nightmare on Elm Street and while I accept the logic of his conclusion I can't help but think it's a tag that is ill deserved and misleading. Those that can only see horror are truly missing out here and only serves to demonstrate they're really not thinking at all. In fact just attempting to classify this wonderful work is probably a bad idea. Quite simply Paperhouse is perfect in every exquisite detail and will always have a special place in my heart. As someone wiser than me once said the film hits you on a completely emotional level which may go some way to explaining why my comments are so unrelentingly gushing. To be honest I make no apology for this so if you feel my words are too saccharine for your taste stop reading now because there's more to come. It's so rare to find a film that has at its heart the pain and heartache of childhood and the struggle to overcome the dreadful feelings of isolation and loneliness that can completely overwhelm us at this fragile time in our lives. Even more unusual to find child actors who can actually play their roles with the sensitivity and intelligence required to make it all work. In Charlotte Burke and Elliott Spiers we had an inspired piece of casting and the lasting impact of Paperhouse owes much to their ability to portray the melancholy and alienation of childhood (often overlooked) in a seamless and convincing way. And yet both of these brilliant young stars seemed to have slipped through the grasp of the studios and have somehow faded away. Add to all this an incredibly talented director (Bernard Rose) imaginative cinematography and the most beautiful and haunting soundtrack you're ever likely to hear and you may start to get an inkling of why I have such affection and affinity for this film that no amount of words can express. 
 Ray Liotta and Tom Hulce shine in this sterling example of brotherly love and commitment. Hulce plays Dominick (Nicky) a mildly mentally handicapped young man who is putting his 12 minutes younger twin brother Liotta who plays Eugene through medical school. It is set in Baltimore and deals with the issues of sibling rivalry the unbreakable bond of twins child abuse and good always winning out over evil. It is captivating and filled with laughter and tears. If you have not yet seen this film please rent it I promise you'll be amazed at how such a wonderful film could go un-noticed. 
 I had the pleasure of seeing this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and was very impressed. Tess Nanavati is clearly a great screenwriter and I would love to see more of her films. If she could do what she did with the budget of this film I'm very anxious to see what she can do with a major picture. Kudos to the cast for their terrific performances (that little girl was gold) and to whoever composed the music. The warped Row Your Boat blew me away. Very creative film all around....I really hope to see it come out on video or DVD because I'd buy it in a second. If you get the chance you should definitely see this film. 
 Even though we know how the story ends this is a gripping fly-on-the-wall film that plays almost like a political thriller. During the calm before the storm we meet Hugo Chavez as a charismatic larger than life man who has an unbreakable connection with the mestizos who make up 80% of the population but have previously been shut out of Venezuela's political process and its oil wealth. He seems as devoted to them as they are to him. He travels the country at a hectic pace reaching out to the campesinos addressing huge crowds hugging and kissing ordinary people accepting letters on scraps of paper and hearing pleas for help. The people are excited that one of their number has made it to the highest office in the land. There is an electric sense of hope and optimism that change for the better is coming to the festering barrios. But not everyone is happy with the situation. The pure-blood Castillian Spaniard elite who are a small minority but previously controlled all the wealth are full of bitterness and resentment. One of the most unintentionally hilarious moments in the film is when an Ann Coulter lookalike at a residents' meeting in an exclusive gated community complains of the mestizos they have no concept of struggle or sacrifice. Minutes later a speaker tells the meeting to beware of your domestic servants - they could be Chavez supporters. Duh! Of course they are. In a late night interview alone with the film crew Chavez reveals something of his soul as he tells the story of his grandfather. He can be a sensitive poetic person though with an impish even clownish sense of humor (like we saw when he addressed the UN and called Bush the devil.) Then the storm starts to gather force as the coup organizers call for a mass protest and cynically manipulate their supporters into changing the route at the last minute and marching on the presidential palace knowing it is surrounded by Chavez supporters and violence is inevitable. Another element of the plot falls into place as snipers on rooftops begin to fire on the Chavez supporters some of whom fire back. The local equivalent of Fox News shows this return fire and claims that Chavez supporters are massacring protesters. Then the camera pulls back and reveals that there are no protesters - the street is empty! The protesters took a different route. Needless to say the footage of the empty street was edited out by the rabidly anti-Chavez private TV stations (who had been airing a constant barrage of propaganda calling Chavez mentally ill and sexually fixated on Fidel Castro.) Immediately after the coup we see the ringleaders and their media propaganda masters openly bragging on TV about how they had manipulated the situation with reckless disregard for the lives of supporters and opponents alike. The filmmakers continue to be at the heart of this chaotic fast-changing situation as the military coup surrounds the palace and threatens to bomb it. Chavez eventually surrenders to avoid bloodshed but refuses to resign and is whisked away to an offshore island where a plane awaits to take him - where? The US? How can the remaining cabinet members avoid arrest and defeat this heavily armed conspiracy of right-wing generals and ultra-wealthy businessmen who are closely linked to the Bush administration? Watch the movie and find out! If your only knowledge of Hugo Chavez and Venezuela is from the US media then you know nothing. He is not an unelected tyrant and does not rule by decree - he is enormously popular having been elected and re-elected several times with over 60% of the vote (something George Bush Junior has never achieved) and the devotion he inspires in ordinary Venezuelan people is ultimately the reason why the coup fails. This is an extraordinary film about an extraordinary man in an extraordinary situation. The skill of the filmmakers is in being unobtrusive and letting the story unfold through the voices of Venezuelans at every level from the barrio to the presidential palace the tumultuous scenes the chaos and confusion out of which a coherent whole emerges that is tense riveting and moving. Not to be missed! 
 I'd never heard of this movie but boy was I surprised when I caught it on TV. Great cast great acting. Excellent movie! How can a movie with William H Macy Neve Campbell and Donald Sutherland go wrong? I wonder why I never heard of it before. 
 The comparison to Sleuth the earlier stage-play-turned-film is obvious and upon my first viewing I too thought Sleuth was better but Deathtrap has at least for me many more repeat viewings in it than Sleuth. I purchased Deathrap in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart figuring that it had Caine and the underrated Reeve and was worth the 6 bucks. It was one of the finest DVD purchases I could've picked up. It's one of those best-kept-secrets that movie buffs always are always delighted to discover. And it's totally worth repeat viewings. Though Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine turned in bravado performances in Sleuth I was doubly impressed with Christopher Reeve as Clifford Anderson. Reeve rightfully associated with his now legendary portrayal of Superman stole the show in what should've been an Oscar worthy performance. I've always felt Reeve was a type-cast actor who didn't get much of a chance to shine outside of the Superman films and a few other flawed but entertaining films like Somewhere in Time but this film shows that his potential was truly tapped and put to use thank goodness. I absolutely relished Michael Caine's performance. He was glib deliciously manipulative and sadistic. And watching him work with Reeve and Dyan Cannon was an absolute pleasure. In fact it was thanks to this movie that I got into a Michael Caine phase and started renting as much of his stuff as humanly possible. As for Deathtrap there's enough juicy dialogue in here to fill up its memorable quotes section. (Unfortunately much of the dialogue would inherently spoil the immensely entertaining plot). It's really really hard to talk about the movie without spoiling important plot points that are infinitely more fun to discover on your own. Needless to say it's a must-see. But for me it was the greatest and most rewarding blind purchase of all time. Repeat viewings are a must. And it deserves to sit alongside Sleuth on your DVD shelf. I'll leave you with this beautifully written quote from the film: I wonder if it wouldn't be...well...just a trifle starry-eyed of me to enter into such a risky and exciting collaboration...where I could count on no sense of moral obligation...whatsoever.  
 All Dog's Go to Heaven is an animated kid's movie like no other. Gambling drinking death guns and Hell are all prominent in the plot and though kids will get very little of it adults will be scratching their heads as to why this movie was made to feel like some sort of gangster movie. The actual movie isn't explicit in any way it's just an odd combination to make a kid's movie on. Charlie Barkin (Burt Reynolds) is a player dog who owns half a casino with his partner Carface (Vic Tayback). After getting drunk (A dog....getting drunk...in a kid's movie. It just sounds weird.) Charlie is tricked and murdered by Carfax. When in heaven he finds a way to come back to Earth but he will no longer be allowed in Heaven. He still goes back to Earth and meets up with his old friend Itchy (Dom Deluise) and plans payback on Carfax. Meanwhile Carfax has a little orphan girl Anne Marie held captive because of her amazing ability to talk to all species of animals which helps predict races. Charlie and Itchy free her and try to help her find a family while learning a lot about themselves. This movie is one of the few non-Disney that will appeal to both kids and adults. Kids will enjoy the funny characters and lively animation while adults will enjoy the nice sweet plot and the more than normal developed characters. One thing that keeps this down is that it's a musical. Normally that's a good thing but the music here is honestly terrible. They tend to jump around almost sounding ad libbed with next to no instrumental backing. In fact these are probably the worst songs I've ever heard in an animated movie but luckily the rest of the film is strong enough to not fall apart because of some bad notes. The ending of this movie works but I honestly hate it. It's sad but happy but more sad than happy and makes the movie feel like it needs a sequel. Considering how bad the sequel made to this was I wish the ending wouldn't have warranted a sequel and it would've wrapped up into a nice super happy ending. This is one of the few movies I feel this way about but I do. Overall this is a nice family film with odd themes thrown in but nonetheless good entertainment. My rating: *** out of ****. 85 mins. G. 
 This was a delightful presentation. Hemo (blood) as a Greek god was so well played by the animation with vanity arrogance snobbish superiority and innocent wonder. The quote (or scene) I recall vividly is when Hemo tires of all this plumbing ... you haven't learned my secrets at all and threatens to storm out the Scientist answers him in a single word Thalassa -- salt water which horrifies the Fiction Writer but mollifies Hemo and segues so neatly into the chemical aspects of blood. Such a splendid blend of entertainment and information make this a classic as fresh and engrossing today as the day it was released. Stimulating the interest and imagination is fundamental to teaching kids to love learning. 
 Originally conceived as a solo vehicle for Dudley Moore 'Not Only...But Also' saw his ex-'Beyond The Fringe' collaborator Peter Cook guest on the first show and so well received was it the controller of B.B.C.-2 insisted that he be on it every week from then on. They were a classic comedy team - Cook was tall handsome and witty while Dudley was short charismatic and musically gifted. The sketch that brought the house down had them in a pub wearing flat caps and mufflers fantasising about movie stars such as Jane Russell and Greta Garbo. It remains one of the most hilarious skits of all time and even when Cook corpses it still holds together well. Those characters - idiot Pete and even-bigger idiot Dud - found their way into every episode of the show proper seen in a different setting such as a zoo or an art gallery. In the latter they munched sandwiches while discussing works of art. That Leonardo DaVinci cartoon...I don't see the joke! says Dud. Pete points out that when it was first unveiled it probably had people in fits. Dud nearly chokes on his repast. You really are enjoying those sandwiches! ad libs Cook. The pair bounced their humour off each other in a way that was joyous to behold. The sketches themselves set new standards for comedy standards that would not be matched until the arrival of 'Monty Python'. As the show's popularity increased so did the quality of the guest stars. Peter Sellers for instance and John Lennon the latter presenting a filmed item based on his poem 'Deaf Ted Danoota & Me'. 'One Leg Too Few' - had Dud as 'George Spigott' ( a name later re-used in the film 'Bedazzled' ) a one-legged man who hops into the office of film producer Cook to audition for the role of 'Tarzan'. Cook tries to let him down as best as he can. I've nothing against your right leg! he says. The trouble is - neither have you! . Dud would on occasion interview the eccentric Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling ( Cook ) who when he was not teaching ravens to fly underwater was planning on opening a restaurant called 'The Frog & The Peach'. Another classic was 'The Leaping Nuns' ( also reused in 'Bedazzled' ). But my all-time favourite has to be 'Superthunderstingcar' a wickedly funny ( and accurate ) parody of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson's 'Thunderbirds'. Pete and Dud played all the roles with the latter making a fetching 'Lady Penelope'. 'Ludwig' had Ludwig Van Beethoven as the star of a 'This Is Tom Jones' style variety show. 'The Immortal Bargo' was a spoof documentary on the life of reclusive movie star 'Emma Bargo'. In an unforgettable moment she drove through London bellowing through a loudhailer: I want to be alone! . A Season 3 feature was 'Poets Cornered' with the likes of Ronnie Barker Spike Milligan Barry Humphries Willie Rushton and others suspended over a gunge tank. They each had to improvise the line of a poem and anyone failing to make it rhyme wound up in the nasty stuff. Three seasons were made in all produced ( at different times ) by Joe McGrath Dick Clement and Jimmy Gilbert. Sadly very few editions survive. To make matters worse the scripts were destroyed as well. It beggars belief that this situation was allowed to happen. The show ended in 1970. The comics then hit Broadway made the infamous 'Derek & Clive' tapes but Cook's ever-increasing alcoholism broke them apart. Eight years later Cook announced that a new series was in the offing but it turned out to be wishful thinking on his part. His ex-partner was making films in America and had no intention of working with Cook again ( not at that time anyway ). Enough footage was scraped together for a season of B.B.C.-2 repeats in the early '90's. As expected some items had not held up as well as others. Cook died in 1995 and by way of a tribute the B.B.C put together a programme compiled from various 'Parkinson' interviews and 'Not Only...But Also' shows. It ended rather appropriately with Pete and Dud finding themselves in Heaven. Bloody Hell! exclaimed the latter. Moore passed on in 2002. 
 Clara Lago is wonderful as the title character of the film essentially a film about a Spanish/American girl who moves to Spain with her mom at the time of the Spanish Civil War. It turns out the mother goes home to die and she is left with her grandfather. She also makes friends and experiences much in a short time. Tomiche (Juan Jose Ballestra) is at first a nuisance to her then they become close. The film is shot beautifully bathed in soft colors mostly. Carol yearns for her dad who is a pilot in the war and you can feel the love sher has for him. While the war itself is kind of taken a back seat in this film it envelops the character's lives. I think you'll like it. See it especially for Clara Lago who does a great job as Carol. She is definitely one to watch. 
 I used to watch this on either HBO or Showtime or Cinemax during the one summer in the mid 90's that my parents subscribed to those channels. I came across it several times in various parts and always found it dark bizarre and fascinating. I was young then in my early teens; and now years later after having discovered the great Arliss Howard and being blown away by Big Bad Love I bought the DVD of Wilder Napalm and re-watched it with my girlfriend for the first time in many years. I absolutely loved it! I was really impressed and affected by it. There are so many dynamic fluid complexities and cleverness within the camera movements and cinematography; all of which perfectly gel with the intelligent intense and immediate chemistry between the three leads their story the music and all the other actors as well. It's truly Cinematic . I love Arliss Howard's subtle intensity ambivalent strength and hidden intelligence I'm a big fan of anything he does; and his interplay with Debra Winger's manic glee (they are of course married) has that magic charming reality to it that goes past the camera. (I wonder if they watch this on wedding anniversaries?....... Big Bad Love should be the next stop for anyone who has not seen it; it's brilliant.) And Dennis Quaid in full clown make-up sneakily introduced angled hidden and displayed by the shot selection and full bloomed delivery is of the kind of pure dark movie magic you don't see very often. Quaid has always had a sinister quality to him for me anyways with that huge slit mouth span hiding behind his flicker eyes lying in wait to unleash itself as either mischievous charm or diabolical weirdness (here as both). Both Howard and Quaid have the insane fire behind the eyes to pull off their wonderful intense internal gunslinger square-offs in darkly cool fashion. In fact the whole film has a darkly cool energy and hip intensity. It's really a fantastic film put together by intelligence imagination agility and chemistry by all parties involved. I really cannot imagine how this got funded and it looks pretty expensive to me by such a conventional imagination-less system but I thank God films like this slip through the system every once in awhile. In a great way with all of its day-glo bright carnival colors hip intelligence darkly warped truthful humor and enthralling chemistry it reminds me of one of my favorite films of all time: Grosse Pointe Blank .......now that's a compliment in my book! 
 Has Al Pacino ever been in a bad movie? His name seems to be an imprimatur for top notch cinema. This is as good a performance as he's ever given. Pacino is an American Olivier. And this is a political thriller as good as they get. There are no good guys and no bad guys. But the system has its inexorable effect on the people who think they're running it. Not only is Pacino's performance compelling --- the eulogy at the dead child's funeral is awesomely powerful --- the film has a fast paced gritty realism to it that enhances the fine performances without resorting to gimmicks. This outstanding portrait of big city politics also manages to provide two hours of superb movie watching without undue violence overheated sex or gutter language. There is murder. There are bad people. But they come across effectively without crossing the line. A film like this restores my jaded faith in Hollywood. I don't award many tens. This one richly deserves it! 
 I am a huge Woody Allen fan and so when I saw that this was playing at the cinema I couldn't help myself. I wanted to see how Allen would follow up his magnificent film Match Point seeing as this is another one of his films shot in G.B. (which is unique among Allen's work) along with what seems to be his new muse Scarlett Johanson. Scoop is much lighter than MP and the humor is Scoop's most enjoyable aspect. The plot revolves around Johanson's character (a journalism student) who gets a tip on a hot story from beyond the grave. She falls in love with a suspected serial killer (Jackman) and she must decide whether the truth is worth finding. Oh and all of this is done with the help of a bumbling magician turned detective played by Allen. I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed Johanson's performance but I am a bit bias I could watch a three hour film with Johanson in ever frame and remain enchanted. She plays a ditsy yappy bumbling sweetheart that is kind of a variation in a sense of Allen's stereotypical neurosis stricken character. She adds appropriate body language for comic effect. Needless to say almost anyone who sees this will find Johanson's character sickeningly cute and that is a plus. Allen is Allen... He is still playing the same character much like Chaplin and his Little Tramp character. Something that occur in this film makes me wonder if I will see the neurotic little hypochondriac again however. He is not in the cast of his next picture and has been spending more time exclusively behind the camera as of late... Jackman is also enjoyable as the suave millionaire murder suspect. I cannot say that Jackman does anything in particular to make the role his but he suits his character none the less. In terms of the plot I cannot help but feel that this is fresh... In fact it stinks of Curse of the Jade Scorpion. Johanson and Allen are more detective-like than anything. However I must applaud Allen on his ending because it is a bit more clever than your typical unoutstanding Hollywood version of this film. Instead of everything being black and white things are painted in shades of gray. Being entirely innocent has nothing to do with it nor does unequivocal guilt. Though the plot seemed old Woody still has a knack for one liners. I did find his allusions to his last film interesting... Come for the humor laugh and be merry. Needless to say if you enjoy Allen's work watch it. If not watch something else... 
 Maybe the movie itself isn't one of the best Jackie Chan's movies but I think everybody will agree with me that the mall fight was one of the best fighting scenes ever made. There also was some memorable stunts which were so impressive that they made this movie an action classic. This movie influenced many other action movies and I think that nowadays action movie makers should learn from this film (like they could remake that chase scene I thing with modern technologies they could make it even better). There also were some funny scenes which made this movie enjoyable even when Jackie wasn't fighting. Althou I think they could put more fighting scenes in this film. 
 Firstly I would like to point out that people who have criticised this film have made some glaring errors. Anything that has a rating below 6/10 is clearly utter nonsense. Creep is an absolutely fantastic film with amazing film effects. The actors are highly believable the narrative thought provoking and the horror and graphical content extremely disturbing. There is much mystique in this film. Many questions arise as the audience are revealed to the strange and freakish creature that makes habitat in the dark rat ridden tunnels. How was 'Craig' created and what happened to him? A fantastic film with a large chill factor. A film with so many unanswered questions and a film that needs to be appreciated along with others like 28 Days Later The Bunker Dog Soldiers and Deathwatch. Look forward to more of these fantastic films!! 
 I had my doubts about another love story wherein disabled individuals find meaning and redemption through honest communication. And it's still not at the top of my list. But the performances from Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh and exemplary almost stunning and rescue this from being just another tear-jerker. Carter's depiction of an ALS victim is strong perhaps even overdone at times (sometimes her dialog dissolves into undistinguishable mutterings). But the overall effect is commendable and rewarding. Branagh may be the perfect compliment to her performance. 
 What makes for Best Picture material? The Oscars have come in for a lot of stick for rewarding overblown spectacles that have aged poorly and ignoring the auteurs who would be deified in decades to come. It wasn't because Hollywood was against art or creativity. The Academy Awards are the selections made by the industry itself and that is why at least in the classic era they tended to reward the greatest collaborations the most sensational meetings of creative minds. The Arthur Freed unit at MGM had been bound for Oscar-winning glory for several years by this point; it was only a matter of time before Freed aided by his strongest director Vincente Minnelli and some the finest musical stars in the business would land a Best Picture. Freed had arguably done more to raise the status of the musical than anyone else crafting pictures which wove story and song together without losing the dynamic spectacle of the 30s musicals. The point about Freed musicals is that the lyrics of the songs unlike those of Hammerstein or Lerner don't have to tell or even relate to the stories. What's important is that the tone of the song and the way it is presented fit into the structure of the film. An American in Paris was the first of three Freed musicals (the other two being Singin' in the Rain and The Band Wagon) which took existing classic numbers out of their original context and made them work in a completely unrelated story. The words don't fit the plot but the routines fit the show. So when Gene Kelly sings I Got Rhythm he hasn't even got a girl yet but the way it's done with the French kids joining in is a great bit of characterisation and the upbeat tune and dance gives the movie the little lift it needs at this point. An American in Paris also uses the rule-breaking allowed in the genre to add little unconventional flights of fancy to tell the story such as the series of dances which accompany the description of Leslie Caron's character. And what better director for this project than Minnelli himself a painter and a pianist? At this time there wasn't really anyone who had a better feel for Technicolor. While some directors would saturate each scene in one colour or fill the screen with clashing shades Minnelli's colour schemes are tightly controlled but never look forced. In the opening scenes the tones are fairly muted but not drab and in particular there is an absence of red. During Oscar Levant and Georges Guetary's meeting in the caf¨¦ a few more vibrant shades are introduced. Then during the first musical number By Strauss Minnelli gradually brings in splashes of red ? a table cloth a bunch of roses ? until it eventually dominates as if the song has awoken the picture's colour scheme. For most of the songs the colours are choreographed as intricately as the people. However in some numbers such as Tra-la-la he keeps the shades the same and instead opens out the space as the song swells up and the characters become more animated. The Achilles' heel of An American in Paris is its story. I personally find the romantic angle particularly unpalatable playing as it does like a last hurrah for the misogynistic love stories that reigned supreme in the 30s; the headstrong independent woman gets rejected while the meek delicate girl is harassed into loving the hero. Even if you don't mind that it is difficult to connect emotionally with the story because it is constantly overshadowed by the songs and dances. Compare this to Singin' in the Rain which doesn't really have as many great routines or memorable set-pieces as An American in Paris but it has a winning storyline. Singin' in the Rain was overlooked at the 1952 Oscars yet it is regarded as a classic of the genre today. But I think people sometimes forget that cinema is an all-encompassing form of visual entertainment not just a means of telling a story. An American in Paris is not deep or engaging or tear-jerking but like a certain DeMille picture that won the top award the following year it certainly is a great show. 
 dear god where do i begin. this is bar none the best movie i've ever seen. the camera angles are great but in my opinion the acting was the best. why the script writers for this movie aren't writing big budget films i will never understand. another is the cast. it is great. this is the best ted raimi film out there for sure. i know some of you out there are probably thinking no way he has plenty better but no your wrong. raptor island is a work of art. i hope it should have goten best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie Crash with a bunch of no names AND no raptors. i believe this movie is truly the most wonderful thing EVER. 
 Let me start by saying at the young age of 34 I was suddenly widowed. I was devastated as he was NOT sick--- he died unexpectedly basically of a coronary--- his carotids blew out-- he died behind our house. There was a lot of speculation from police cause he fell on something and it bashed his head in. I was a suspect for murder until the autopsy came back. My children were as traumatized as I was so in love with a good father figure as he. I had three small children no education no financial support. I took it very very hard. Within two years my in-laws attacked me verbally physically emotionally and spiritually demanding I grieve not in front of the children and put on masks and showed people what they wanted to see not show them my pain during holidays... Nobody stood up for me and my choice to sit out one holiday except of course the grief therapist I was seeing that had advised me to follow my heart and soul. My in-laws didn't get it! It changed FOREVER my relationship with them and I have never been back for a holiday. This is only one example of how my grief was disrespected! My own (new) husband has seen me fall apart talking about the trauma when I shared from my soul. I collapse can not breathe hyperventilate and generally am defunct for a few days if I even try to convey the hidden pain. Now about this movie... Today my soul was stirred my heart broken. My fears and pain re-surfaced from the real demons this movie presents; how one grieves compared to how others expect us too and the demons within. Adam Sandler portrayed perfectly the horrendous agony you face overcome and most of all work through on your own time! This movie dredged up all the pain that I have tried over the years to deal with. You see when something harms your soul so profoundly so deep that utterances are all that come from your mouth in moments of thinking you can not deal with it without wishing you were dead and walking through life in a dead state. The bible has a scripture Romans 8:26 that I have clung to that when my mouth and soul know not what to pray for that God's Holy Spirit carries that agony to the feet of God-- I need not speak. Sandler portrayed that to perfection! There is a scene where he has been hauled into a court hearing for mental health commitment purposes and he goes back in to face his in-laws--- (familiar to me)--- and he tells them the stunning truths that he has been possessed by per Se that he can't get over. It's a profoundly strong and mighty performance. I started bawling and had a hard time after wards getting up to walk out from the theater feeling my legs too weak to do so. My son was with me and saw it first hand my precise motions while trying to hold it all together; a lesson for him my youngest who barely remembers his daddy. It's been 13 years for me but this movie brought me back to the moment of losing my in-laws forever when they demanded a mask on my emotions and my surrendering to their desires instead of respect to my own. I write this so that if you are a griever you are prepared for this movie but recommend it highly in the 1000 star performance Sandler gave. If you are not yet a griever please take a lesson from his movie and just listen and accept people's choices in their grief letting them find peace in their own time! Sometimes the soul can not utter the words to convey our pain. Go see this movie with tissues and not without preparing to take it in... to your soul! 
 I'm still new to the Krimi genre and the only one I've seen prior to seeing this one was the earlier and somewhat disappointing 'The Dead Eyes of London' which didn't exactly inspire a great hope for the rest of the genre in me. If I'd seen this one first however the feeling would have been different as while The College Girl Murders is a bizarre and rather wacky attempt at a crime flick; it's great fun to watch and it's really hard to hate a film that throws so many weird and wonderful ideas into the script and manages to pull it off with style. The film begins in a lab where a crazy scientist has invented a new and highly toxic poison that kills its victim and makes it look like they died from a heart attack. This poison is used by a mysterious criminal mastermind who breaks common criminals out of jail to carry out his murders using this poison (and then has them put back in jail). As the title suggests it's a nearby college full of girls that provides most of the victims. There's also a mysterious monk dressed in a red robe who marauds around breaking necks with a bullwhip. Of course with a plot like that; this is not exactly a serious affair and the director clearly knows that as there is a very tongue-in-cheek vibe to the film which does bode well with the plot. The fact that there are so many different sides to the plot does unfortunately mean that everything does not run smoothly; although this isn't a big problem as things are kept ticking over nicely throughout the film and there's always enough going on to keep the audience interested. The atmosphere is superb and the colour scheme on display is great too look at. Of course the film is based on an Edgar Wallace novel and clearly the man has a great imagination; the locations used are also superb and while a killer's lair decked out with a host of wild and exotic animals might not serve any relevance to the plot it does help to give the film that extra 'something'. You cant expect a conclusion that fully makes sense after all the stuff that goes on in this film; but the reason for the murders sort of makes sense and is a satisfying way for the film to climax. Overall College Girl Murders is an excellent little mystery flick and one that comes highly recommended! 
 This film is shockingly underrated on IMDb. Like so many films this isn't Shawshank. But it's a reasonably good if predictable dance competition / personal growth film. If you want to spend an hour and a half watching a sort of 8 Mile for a female step dancer than I think you'll like it. Judging from the IMDb ratings my guess is that this movie was approaching the top 250 and was vote bombed with many 1s as happens to so many films that aren't about the mob don't have special effects or include non-white or non-straight characters. It's an American film but it's not a US film. Set mostly in Toronto the cues are subtle and some audiences may think it's set entirely in the US just because the final competition is in the border city of Detroit. I liked the music. I liked the dance (but not convinced it's worth $50 000 ... but what do I know). The characters were easy on the eyes. I do agree the title sucks. I don't remember anyone in the film saying those words and it should have an s . (No it's not a foreign language). There's not a lot to hate about this film (and let's be honest a vote of 1 means you hated it) so I can only assume that it's an expression of hate for the kind of people in it and that's sad. 
 there is a story but more essentially the world of this film begins in chaos and comes to order over the course of ten minutes. it is a celebration of life and an optimistic assertion of objective truth and good. representing along an axis unexplored in previous cinema this film should be taught in every high school. *CHIASMUS* 
 I really enjoyed this movie. The acting by the adult actors was great although I did find the main kid a little stiff. But he carried himself very well for being a new talent. The humor is very sublime and not in your face like most Hollywood comedy junk. I.e. The Nutty Professor. If you have a short attention span and are used to the typical Hollywood stuff you probably wouldn't like this as it is a bit slower paced. I picked it up on Blu-ray and I have to say the image quality is top notch. Probably one of the better looking Blu-rays I've seen so far. The extras were cool too. They deleted quite a bit but that's probably a good thing as most of the deleted scenes didn't really add anything. 
 Yes Keaton looks like he really did enjoy making this film. With a skip in his step in his tailored pin-striped suits he'll remind you of Jimmy Cagney! Johnny (Keaton) is the young hood who only does it to pay for his mother's high-priced medical bills & to send his younger brother (Griffin Dunne) to law school. No one even knows Johnny Kelly IS Johnny Dangerously until later on in the film. Joe Piscopo is Vermin & doesn't like Johnny one bit (& I don't like Vermin). Marilu Henner has a nice singing/dancing routine while Johnny revels in it. I love the part when they're in the ever-changing getaway car! The cop who's calling all cars is the Skipper from Gilligan's Island! See this one for 1930's gangster laughs! The gags in this film are hilarious but you have to catch them or you'll miss them! Look in the background of every scene. 
 I noticed this movie was getting trashed well before it hit the theaters and I too didn't have high hopes for it. I figured it was another You Got Served type of movie with some nice dance moves and horrid acting. I was at the theater and deciding between this and Meet the Spartans and picked this. To my surprise the acting wasn't bad at all and the movie was actually pretty good. The fact that it has a lower rating than You Got Served is absolutely ridiculous. Instead of listening to the garbage posted on here I recommend going to see a matin¨¦e showing of this movie so you don't spend too much. I think you will be pleasantly surprised with how wrong everyone has been about it. When it comes to dance movies this is certainly one of the better ones with far superior acting than many of the other ones. Go see the movie and judge for yourself. Hopefully the rating will rise after it comes out on DVD and more people check the movie out instead of judging it based on comments before the movie released. edit The movie is now moving closer to its correct rating. Over 1000 people have given it a rating of 9 a bit too high but at least it is helping to offset the ridiculous votes of 1. 
 One of the most important artistic movements in the history of cinema was without a doubt German expressionism the highly atmospheric style of film-making developed during the 20s in Berlin. Classic movies like Das Cabinet Des Dr. Caligari. (1920) and Nosferatu Eine Symphonie Des Grauens (1922) were the most famous direct results of this movement and while the movement didn't have a long life its enormous influence over cinema can still be felt today specially in the horror genre. One of the key figures of this style would be director Paul Wegener director of 1920's Der Golem Wie Er in die Welt Kam as in his debut as a filmmaker seven years before the making of that classic he was already making experiments with expressionism in film. That early prototype of German expressionism was incidentally another horror film: Der Student Von Prag . Der Student Von Prag ( The Student of Prague ) is the story of Balduin (Paul Wegener) a student with the reputation of being the best fencer in Prague but who always find himself with financial troubles. One day Balduin rescues the beautiful countess Margit (Grete Berger) from drowning in a lake after her horse drop her by accident. Balduin falls immediately in love with her and tries to see her again but soon he discovers that he'll have to compete with her rich cousin Graf Von Schwarzenberg (Lothar K?rner) who also wants to marry her. Knowing that he can't offer her much Balduin wishes to be wealthy and this is where a sorcerer named Scapinelli (John Gottowt) enters the scene. Scapinelli offers Balduin infinite wealth in exchange of whatever he finds in his room. Balduin accepts the proposal only to discover in horror that what Scapinelli wants is his reflection in the mirror. Loosely inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's short story William Wilson and the classic legend of Faust the story of Der Student Von Prag was conceived by German writer Hanns Heinz Ewers a master of horror literature and one of the first writers to consider scriptwriting as valid as any other form of literature. Written at a time where cinema in Germany was still being developed as an art form Der Student Von Prag shows a real willingness to actually use cinema to tell a fully developed story beyond a camera trick or a series of scenes. Like most of the scriptwriters of his time Ewers screenplay is still very influenced by theater although Der Student Von Prag begins to move away from that style. While a bit poor on its character development (specially on the supporting characters) Ewers manages to create an interesting and complex protagonist in the person of Balduin. While Der Student Von Prag was Paul Wegener's directorial debut and Stellan Rye's second film as a filmmaker it's very clear that these two pioneers had a very good idea of what cinema could do when done properly. Giving great use to Guido Seeber's cinematography the two young filmmakers create a powerful Gothic atmosphere that forecasts what the German filmmakers of the following decade would do. Wegener would learn many of the techniques he would employ in his Golem series from Seeber and Rye. Despite having very limited resources Rye and Wegener manage to create an amazing and very convincing (for its time) visual effect for the scenes with Balduin's reflection (played by Wegener too). Already an experienced stage actor at the time of making this film Wegener directs the cast with great talent and also attempts to move away from the stagy style of previous filmmakers. As Balduin Paul Wegener is very effective and probably the best in the movie. It certainly helps that his character is the only one fully developed by the writer but one can't deny that Wegener was very good in his role as the poor student who loses more than his mirror reflection in that contract. John Gottowt plays the sinister Scapinelli with mysterious aura that suits the character like a glove. Few is said about Scapinelli in the film but Gottowt makes sure to let us know that he is a force to be feared. The rest of the main cast is less lucky with Grete Berger being pretty much average as countess Margit and Lothar K?rner making a poor Graf Von Schwarzenberg. However it must be said that Lyda Salmonova was pretty good in her expressive character and Fritz Weidemann made an excellent Baron Waldis-Schwarzenberg showing the dignity that L?rner's character should have had. Considering the movies that were being done in those years in other countries and the fact that its remake (made 13 years after this film) is superior in every possible way it's not difficult to understand why Der Student Von Prag hasn't stood the test of time as well as other early films. The movie's main problem is definitely its extremely low budget as it resulted in the film being considerably shorter than what Ewers' story needed to be fully developed. This makes the plot feel a bit too vague at times or even incomplete as if there was something missing in the narrative (of course there's also the possibility that the existing print is really incomplete). However Der Student Von Prag is a very interesting early attempt at a complex tale of horror and suspense in film that while inferior to what other filmmakers were doing at the time left a powerful impression in history. As the direct predecessor of the German expressionist movement it's hard to deny the enormous importance that Der Student Von Prag has in the history of German cinema probably in the history of cinema in general. It may look dated even for its time but considering the limited resources its director had it's truly better than most films from that era. As the movie that started Paul Wegener's career and with that German expressionism Der Student Von Prag is a must see for everyone interested in this slice of film history. 7/10 
 I remember liking this more than Nausicaa of the valley of the winds at an age when that tone of story was too serious for me. Laputa whose title seems to have affected its release in the U.S. to avoid confusion to its wide Hispanic audiences has the cartoonish knack of the director's debut production Conan. In fact Pazu has the thick bones and immortal vitality of Conan--who jumped off a thousand stories carrying his girl in his arms and landed on his feet then started running. This makes him the most animated and pleasing character to watch. The techie fans of Nausica may be disappointed by the flying bugs and the retro technology through out Laputa--the only exception may be the robot. Unlike Princess Mononoke and Valley of the Winds the theme in Laputa is not directly connected to environmentalism. If it has a theme at all it's anti-warfare. The importance of living naturally--this is related with the flying castle is dismissably shortly discussed and not really followed through. Overall I now regard the piece as being at an intersection between feel-good and corny. 
 I really like Star Trek Hidden Frontier it is an excellent fan fiction film series and i cant wait to see more I have only started watching this film series last week and i just cannot get enough of it. I have already recommended it too other people to watch since it is well worth the view. I have already watched each episode many times over and am waiting to see more episodes come out. I rated it a ten but i think it deserves a 12 loll My compliments to the staff of the Star Trek Hidden Frontiers on an excellent job. If u like Star Trek i highly recommend checking out this star trek fan fiction film. The detail associated with this series of films is excellent especially the ships and planets used in it 
 This show is awesome! I have been a fan since it premiered and it only keeps me watching... I've seen some terrible things here that I wish I hadn't BUT it really shows you how addiction affects all involved not just the addict. You can see all kinds of different addictions from drugs and alcohol to the shopping addict or the eating disorder addict. And actually it's really sad to see some of the famous faces that have come through also. We've seen accomplished musicians an NBA player and even young people who really need the help. And since they have started showing a few follow-ups that's been awesome too. Now you can see how they are a long while after their ep aired. If you haven't checked this one out please do. It's on A&E and it's awesome! The new eps are Sunday nights at 10PM EST if I remember correctly... so set your TiVo! 
 This movie is a lot of fun. What makes it great especially are two things: one is the straightforward way the characters embrace the stereotypes with discussions of their costumes and superpowers. There's an endearing earnestness to the parody that's very appealing; the second is basic sweetness of the characters and the quality of the chemistry. Claire Forlani deserves particular note as the object of Mr. Furious's desires. There's a boatload of talent here. I realize some with high expectations may have been disappointed but this movie is a lot of fun and kind of sweet. 
 Polanski returns to the themes of solitude and madness which he explored to such tremendous effect in Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby in The Tenant. The atmosphere is trademark Polanski - dark brooding unnerving - but there is something awkward about this movie and I am not sure whether or not it is deliberate. Sven Nykvist who was responsible for some of Bergman's most beautiful films doesn't quite do himself justice here. As his name was one of the things which really attracted me to this movie I was a little disappointed in how few instances of truly impressive cinematography are in the film. The only thing that really lets the movie down is the acting. Polanski is certainly not a bad actor but he seems to have bitten off more than he can chew with the difficult role of Trelkovsky. Some of the supporting cast are great notably Melvyn Douglas as the landlord and Shelley Winters as the concierge but others are weak and miscast. It is also hard to get past the fact that all these supposed Parisians have American accents. Quite unexpectedly there are some fine moments of dark comedy in the film. Anyone who has seen The Fearless Vampire Killers knows that Polanski is certainly a good comedic actor. However there are moments when it slips dangerously close to being a parody of itself. Trelkovsky's sudden (and somewhat unexplained) 'transformation' is more likely to raise giggles than eyebrows which detracts from what should have been a powerful moment in his psycho-dramatic journey. All in all The Tenant is an enjoyable and intriguing experience if a little too languorous for its own good. There's a handful of exceptionally chilling moments and a consistently uncomfortable and foreboding atmosphere but this film while being very good does not quite hit the mark as successfully as it could have. Alas at the end of the day an 'okay' Polanski movie is still better than most other 'good' movies. Definitely worth a watch just don't expect to be blown away. 
 I first saw the trailer for Frailty on Yahoo Movies way back in the day after hearing Stephen King praise it to high heaven. Not really a fan of either star I still wanted to see it because I'm a huge thriller fan. I was not disappointed. The acting was superb especially from the two young boys. Usually I loathe child actors but Young Adam and Young Fenton were excellent. Bill Paxton really did a good job of directing it too. It was beautifully shot. One must also note the plot twists. The three twists at the end hit hard and fast and I didn't see them coming. The final twist of the film coupled with the gravity of what had just been revealed gives me chills to this day even though I've re-watched the film so many times. A true gem. 
 The John Van Druten Broadway hit is brought to the screen with a maximum of star power in this romantic fantasy about a modern-day witch who beguiles a successful Manhattan publisher. James Stewart may get top billing but it is Kim Novak who steals the show as one of the most alluring witches ever to cast a spell on the movie screen. The lead pairing is in fact one of the movie's few weaknesses: the gray-haired Stewart seems a bit old for the role and while it is easy to see why he falls hard for Novak it's a little harder to understand what she finds attractive about him as they seem mismatched in temperment and outlook. (It is one of the story's amusing conceits that witches and warlocks are portrayed as Greenwich Village beatniks and bohemians.) Curiously the Stewart-Novak pairing would generate a lot more heat in Vertigo released the same year as this film but then Vertigo had a compelling suspense story and the benefit of Alfred Hitchcock's direction. The film's comic moments are mostly provided by the stellar supporting cast including a young Jack Lemmon (as Kim's warlock brother) Elsa Lanchester (their ditzy aunt) and Ernie Kovacs (!) as a befuddled writer. Hermione Gingold even shows up in a hilarious cameo as a sort of Grand Witch. There's lots to like in this movie--wit romance and a great cast--that is if you can possibly take your eyes off the enchanting Miss Novak. I have seen the movie a half a dozen times and I never can. 
 I didn't mind all the walking. People really did walk places back then. It loaned an air of authenticity to this period piece and some perspective on the technology of the Martians. I too was disappointed by the effects in particular the Thunderchild scene which I regard as one of the most exciting in the book. But I can't praise this film enough for its faithfulness to Wells's story! It's about time. The actors are likable and the performances are charming. Also this film is very much worth seeing just to hear Jamie Hall's truly great musical score. It was interesting to see the same actor play both the writer and his brother in London. 
 What is contained on this disk is a first rate show by a first rate band. This disc is NOT for the faint of heart...the music is incredibly intense and VERY cool. What you will learn when you watch this movie is just why the Who was so huge for so long. It is true that their records were great but their shows were the top of the heap. In 1969 when this concert was shot the screaming teenie boppers that threw jelly beans at the Beatles were gone and bands (and audiences) had settled down to long and often amazing displays of musical virtuosity--something that few audiences have the intellectual curiosity to pursue in the age of canned music by Britney and Christina. What you especially learn here are the amazing things that can happen when gifted musicians are encouraged to improvise. Try the concert out it really is amazing. 
 A comedy gem. Lots of laugh out loud moments the shop and pub scenes had me belly- laughing uncontrollably. The characters are recognisable and the dialogue well-observed - I know people like this! The humour is surprisingly gentle and the film (this may sound strange) puts me in mind of an Ealing Comedy. It's a quirky little film with lots of detail. It certainly takes a number of viewings. I've watched it a few times (I've been showing all my friends!) and notice something new each time - a bit of dialogue something visual that I hadn't picked up on before. I could get really picky and find a couple of shortcomings in the film but I'm not going to because overall this is a great fun feel-good film which is really worth a watch and which anyone with a sense of humour must enjoy. It is a film which will find it's friends and I hope there are a lot of them out there. Oh.... and It has a great soundtrack. 
 I caught this movie on my local movie channel and i rather enjoyed watching the film. It has all the elements of a good teen film and more - this film aside from dealing with boys-girls relationships and sex and the like also deals with the issue of steroid use by young people. The film has that real-life feel to it - no loud music no special effects and no outrageous scenes - which for this movie was right. That feel makes it easy to relate to the characters in the film - some of which we probably know from where we live. Overall a good movie fun to watch. 8/10 
 When I learned of Sir Alec Guinness' death this was the first of his many films I thought of re-seeing. What a wonderful droll commentary the film provides even after all these years. And Guinness helps to weave the charm into every frame. His eyes and face are as luminous as that white suit he wears. Both he and the film have to be considered lifetime favorites. 
 THE TENANTS began as a 1971 short novel by the now deceased Bernard Malamud - writer/philosopher - examining the conflicts between Jews and African Americans in the incendiary atmosphere of Brooklyn at the time the book was written. As a novel the story was gut wrenchingly real: as transcribed into a screenplay by novices David Diamond and Danny Green (who also directs) it is more of a cerebral dissertation that gradually erupts into action in the final moments. Harry Lesser (Dylan McDermott) is a Jewish novelist with one book under his belt but currently attempting to finish his 'newest' book ten years into the writing. Convinced that he must complete the novel in the same environment where it was started. he is the sole tenant in a condemned Brooklyn tenement owned by Levinspiel (Seymour Cassel) who constantly tries to 'buy out' Harry's lease so that the filthy dilapidated building can be demolished. Into this atmosphere enters another Black militant quasi-anti-Semitic writer Willie Spearmint (Snoop Dogg) whom Harry befriends hides and offers help to the nascent novelist's attempt to write about the death of all white people. Harry's attempts to help Willie lead to conflict not the least of which is Harry's meeting Willie's girlfriend the white Jewish Irene Bell (Rose Byrne) at a less than friendly gathering of Willie's militant black brothers and sisters. Willie and Irene are on the skids and Harry gradually falls in love with Irene and they plan to leave New York as soon as Harry finishes his novel. When Willie hears of the assignation and is further critiqued by Harry Willie explodes and begins the downward descent of not only a delicate friendship but also a competition between writers. The ending 'reveals the slippery nature of the human condition and the human capacity for violence and undoing'. The actors do their best with a script that is a bit awkward but despite scripted lines that border on preaching they create believable characters. The cinematography enhances the story keeping the mood dank and dense and primarily confined to the condemned building. The musical score appropriately makes use of the solo jazz trumpet and blues piano to underline the tension and isolation of each of these groundless characters. Though it takes some patience to make it through the cerebral ramblings the film in the end is worth watching. At least it attempts to recreate Malamud's bizarre look at life in the big city.

 this movie is a very relaxed romantic-comedy which is thoroughly enjoyable. Meg Ryan does a very good job as the genius niece of Albert Einstein though she does believe in her own skills. Tim Robbins does an equally good job as the mechanic who falls in love with her when she comes into his shop with her fianc¨¦ after her car stuffs up. I loved Walter Matthau as the one and only Albert Einstein. This movie just has a very relaxing feel to it while still keeping some sort of seriousness to it (if that is actually possible it happens here). I personally found this movie extremely entertaining especially the old scientists - i thought they were fab and hilarious! This movie seems to have been underestimated beyond comprehension. If you have a cheeky sense of humour this is the movie for you! 
 Excellent. Gritty and true portrayal of pioneer ranch life on the Western plains with an emphasis on the woman's role and place. A moving film lovingly made and based on real people and their actual experiences. Low budget independent film; never made any money. Definitely not the romanticized unrealistic Hollywood version of pioneer life. 
 I don't know much about the Rat Pack and Frank Sinatra always seemed a bit too self-consciously full of himself to me. So when I call this one of my all-time faves it's nothing to do with a tribute-band mentality. As another reviewer says Mad Dog Time is about symbolism not realism. It's kafkaesque (a pity Kyle MacLachlan is probably the weakest of a very strong crowd when he was so good as Josef K) it's stylish knowing sardonic and slick. Jeff Goldblum is navigating his way around a variety of characters trying not to get shot and acting deftly rather than dorkily trying to stay abreast of what he knows and others don't whom he can outshoot and whom he can't. Gabriel Byrne and Richard Dreyfuss (his best performance) have a ball and the supporting cast look spot-on. The symbolism the settings (the one outdoor motion shot with Jeff Goldblum walking down the steps seems really weird after so much lounge lizardry) the dialogue (style not practicality is the order of the day) it's all about characters interacting not really gangsterism. Fun to watch must've been fun to do. What the critics were up to is really a mystery... 
 This is absolutely the best none-animated family film I've seen in quite a while back to the first Homeward Bound. Paulie is a humerous movie about life through a parrot's POV. It's a really touching movie and ranks high among family films up to Disney status IMHO. 
 Thank the Lord for Martin Scorsese and his love of the movies. This is the perfect introduction into the mind of the most talented American artist working in cinema today and I couldn't recommend it more. I was enthralled through the whole thing and you will be too. Just relax and let him take you on a ride through his world you'll love it. 
 Welcome to Collingwood offers some of the most hilarious dialog in recent memory. Watching this comedy directed by the brothers Anthony and Joe Russo reminded us of maybe another film we had seen in the past but since we missed the opening credits we had to wait until the end to discover that what we were reminded of was the 1958 Italian film Big Deal on Madonna Street directed by Mario Monicelli. The Russo brothers put together a magnificent cast to portray all the characters in the film. Anything with William H. Macy Luis Guzman Sam Rockwell Patricia Clarkson the late Michael Jeter in it can't be bad. Since this is an ensemble piece all characters get an opportunity in which to shine. The film presents us a group of inane would-be safe crackers from hell. No one could think these men could carry on a job like the one they undertake. Whatever could go wrong and more is what they succeed in doing. George Clooney makes a small appearance as the master safe cracker who is also seen impersonating a rabbi only to be confused with a priest by the gang members coming out of Cossimo's funeral. The best way to enjoy the movie is to sit back and relax and let all these small time crooks do their thing. Let their funny lines make you laugh as anyone can see this gang is doomed from beginning to end! 
 I have seen this movie more than several times on TV. I ALWAYS watch it again...NEVER turning the channel. This movie is full of chilling surprises and absolutely edge-of-your-seat suspenseful without being overbearing or stupid. Helen Hunt's talent is magnificently shown in this movie! I recommend this movie to anyone!!! 
 A must see movie for anyone who ever went to camp or wanted to. This film captures the absolute essence of what summer camp is all about. It is funny it is compassionate it makes you want to watch more about the characters once the credits begin to role. If you have not seen this movie..what are you doing? get off you butt and run the video store. Have a great summer :) 
 I took my 19 year old daughter with me to see this interesting exercise in movie making. I always find it intriguing to get views and opinions from a different generation on movies especially as I'm such a cynic myself. It's good to get an unjaded opinion from someone who hasn't yet reached the been there done that approach to every movie she sees. I'm pleased to say that we both really enjoyed it and regarded it as a successful mother / daughter evening out. Far far better than going to see some brain dead chick flick which I gather is what we are supposed to enjoy according to the demographics? Eighteen directors were asked to produce a short piece about each of the arrondissements of Paris a city I haven't visited in 20 years. But I wish I had. They are loosely linked by joining shots and represent different approaches to love in the city regarded in popular culture as the quintessential romantic capital of the world. Some of the films work better than others but as other reviewers have said it never descends too far into kitsch. Some are funny some are sad some intriguing and some just plain puzzling (I'm still trying to discern some deep inner truth to the Flying Tiger Hidden Dragon hairdressing salon.) Some are just fun and perhaps shouldn't be assigned too much meaning (the vampire and the tourist for example.) Possibly my only criticism of the whole film is that it makes Paris look too good. It can also be cold wet foggy indifferent and miserable or in summer baking hot and packed with so many tourists that you feel like a sardine in a can queuing up for hours to see every attraction. But I'm nit picking. My personal favourite by far was the Coen brothers film shot on the Tuileries Metro station and starring a perfectly cast Steve Buscemi as a confused tourist who inadvertently finds himself caught up in a lovers' tiff. Absolutely perfect and very very funny without Buscemi having to say a word. I also perversely enjoyed the piece about the two mime artists which was probably the closest the movie got to being cutesy - that certainly teetered on the edge of kitsch but it just stayed on the right side. Rufus Sewell and Emily Mortimer gaining insight from an encounter with Oscar Wilde's tomb left me pretty indifferent and Juliette Binoche trying to cope with the death of her small son made me very very uncomfortable. I thought both the Bob Hoskins / Fanny Ardent piece and Ben Gazzara / Gena Rowlands fell a bit flat but Maggie Gyllenhaal was good (has she cornered the market in junkies? I watched Sherry Baby last week.) But I felt the two social justice pieces (for want of a better way of putting it) worked very well. By that I mean first of all the film about the young mother leaving her own child in a day care to go and look after someone else's baby across town. And then the film about the African migrant struggling to exist on the margins of an indifferent society who is stabbed and dies in the street in front of a young new paramedic. Yet another murder statistic in a world which sees thousands of migrants dying in the struggle to reach what they see as a better life every year. I thought both pieces very well observed. The final film 14th Arrondissement in which Margo Martindale plays a postal worker from Colorado recounting the story of her first trip to Paris ? in very badly accented French ? to her night school French class moved me. A perfect ending to a good intriguing if not quite great movie. Paris je t'aime was an ambitious idea but it works pretty well. 
 Interesting characters lots of tension. As close to black and white without being black and white. I was turned off by how casually the supposedly sympathetic mainstream character a quiet near deaf secretary was able to turn to crime to ruin colleagues rough up people in her way and finally participate in a heist and set up someone to be bumped off as a decoy to her own get-away. I'm a little put off by the trend for otherwise quality movies to portray criminals in a sympathetic way without addressing the injury they've done to others other than to portray their immediate opponents as jerks. In this film we never know who's money it really is they abscond with or what happens to the innocent wife who the sympathetic deaf-secretary uses to set up the of the sleazy bar owner to take the fall for the missing loot. Too bad the film could have been great. 
 I think that the idea of the plot is perfect for exploring first of all the emotional experiences of the people involved and second as someone else wrote in a comment the implications of this kind of relationships (incest and lesbianism) in the romanian society. so... to begin with the second aspect... to make it short it wasn't visible at all... as for the first.. as i said it had much more potential... i think that those kind of relationships carry much more tension... much more tension... and the potential tension didn't get through... i think the soundtrack could've been more than those few songs on the background and the theme (wich was nice but not enough and not always in the right moments)... yeah... i could feel the absence of a better soundtrack.. the actors... i think that they were somewhere from 7 to 8/10... not enough sensuality in the key moments... a total of 7/10.... mostly for the story 
 Don't believe all of the negative reviews this movie receives. Yes it is cheaply made. Yes the gore is laughable. And yes the acting is sub-par. However this is a textbook example of an early slasher flick and if that is your thing (its mine!) then you will enjoy this one. There are enough good aspects to this movie to more than compensate for the drawbacks. For one the score by a then unknown Christopher Young is very creepy and accents the violence perfectly. The ending is a welcomed break from the predictable upbeat endings of most movies. And last but not least the setting is what made the film for me. The makers of this film could have done a much better job dressing the set to make it more believable as a college dorm. However if you can overlook this flaw the setting is great. Four collegiates all alone in a huge abandoned condemned building just waiting to be torn down.... it reaks of possibility. When watching allow your imagination to do some of the work and you may enjoy this film as much as I did. 
 Yes this is one of the great musical movies I grew up with with such great entertainers as Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly not to mention the petite and glorious voice of Kathryn Grayson. The music and dancing is superb. I understand Frank took lessons from Kelly; and there is Kelly dancing with Jerry Mouse which is quite unique for the time. Betty Garrett plays the waitress who falls in love with Sinatra. She is one of Hollywood's great underrated stars. I saw this again on A&E TV and as well have it in my old VCR tapes. Never get tired of these old musicals. Whatever happened to Hollywood?? 
 There is no denying that Ealing comedies are good but for me this film stands out as one of the best. The basic premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered to be part of Burgundy not the UK. We then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from UK law rationing does not exist. When they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the boarder we see them fight back against the system. They are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right. In fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started that's where the moral comes in. It's when they loose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender only to have the whole of London respond to their plight by sending food lot's of it. Thus enabling them to continue their struggle. This film hit's the right note throughout the acting is superb with Stanley Holloway Margaret Rutherford Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren standing out. It's pitched just right not too sentimental and the moral of the story not forced down your throat. Well worth a viewing 
 The pre-release version of 1933's Baby Face would make an ideal introduction to a corporate seminar on sexual harassment. Mentored by a Nietszchean professor Lily Powers rises from a life of easy virtue at her father's speakeasy to a rapid climb up the corporate ladder at a large bank. Because each rung of the ladder is an executive with his brain below his belt and his ethics locked in the vault the film has no victims except Lily's childhood which was destroyed by an abusive exploitative father. The destructive relationship with her father suggests Lily's hidden motive for using men to advance without regard for their fate. While Lily is cynical and obvious in her approach the men she targets willingly betray wives and fianc¨¦s to trade jobs for sexual favors. Perhaps the bank failures in the 1930's owed less to economics than to morally corrupt executives distracted by ambitious women. The plot moves fast and the camera amusingly moves from window to window up the fa?ade of the office building as Lily climbs ever higher. Barbara Stanwyck reveled in tough hard-bitten roles and she is in top form here. Sentiment does not intrude when she is ready to climb the next rung. Only her African-American confidante Chico receives Lily's affection trust and loyalty. In more enlightened times the fresh natural beauty of Theresa Harris who plays Chico would have had the men throwing the furs and penthouses at her. Stanwyck often appears overly made-up and stiffly coiffed in comparison to Harris. However despite Stanwyck's tough demeanor obvious tactics and artificial visage she manages to leave a trail of duped and seduced men including Douglass Dumbrille Donald Cook and a young John Wayne. The preferred version of Baby Face is the 76-minute restored cut. The edited release version of the film shyly turns from the hard facts which the longer cut restores and makes explicit. Perhaps Darryl Zanuck who wrote the story under an assumed name intended a lesson by quoting from Nietszche whose views on women were controversial. However despite Alphonse Ethier's lectures and advice not to be defeated by life Lily's grab for power and money likely owed more to her upbringing and her father than to her professorial mentor. However the philosophy is but a distraction. Short fast paced and entertaining Baby Face is as contemporary in its morality as Wall Street. Substitute Gordon Gecko for Nietszche and Lily could have declared her guiding philosophy to be greed is good.  
 David Webb Peoples meets Paul Anderson...if it already sounds weird to you then you are right because it is. Peoples is known for his scripts with moral implications of what is right and wrong the value of life etc... He covered these issues in Bladerunner Unforgiven and pretty much in all of his screenplays there is something along those lines. Paul Anderson's first successful movie was a violent thriller. Not surprisingly so have all of his other movies! And here is a violent thriller with moral implications! Peoples' script is quite apparent in the first half of the movie. Soldiers trained from birth taught to kill and never had a normal life. They are replaced by better genetically engineered soldiers and Todd one of the original soldiers is left on a planet and left for dead. There he must cope with a group of refugees some want him to stay others hate him and there is an interesting drama here. BUT THEN... ...The bullets start to fly as the new soldiers move onto the planet for a military exercise and try to kill all the people. Big violent loud action ensues and Peoples' script turns into an Anderson action-fest. It is hard to believe that the script was originally written that way but the end product is better then I expected. Entertaining somewhat though admittedly not very thought-provoking and exciting once the action starts. 7/10 Rated R: a lot of violence 
 An ultra-modern house in an affluent neighborhood appears to be the cause of each of its inhabitants bizarre (and deadly) behavior. Or at least that is what Lara Flynn Boyle's character Col Kennedy argues. After a series of deadly occurrences in a gargantuan house next door Col knows something has got to give. Mark-Paul Gosselaar also stars as the mysterious architect. My opinion: The House Next Door works because of Lara Flynn Boyle and the locations (beautiful house) and stylish sets. Boyle is a talented and dynamic actress not to mention absolutely stunning. She brings credibility to her character and makes the film intriguing. Without her it would have failed. It's so alive declares a prospective buyer in reference to the house. Yes it is alive. But the story itself is not so much. Barring Boyle's presence not much is happening here as an enormous amount of the movie is spent watching or waiting to see how the house will affect its current owners. The results are predictable. But I liked it anyway. The cinematography lends the film a polished look. 8/10 on account of Boyle the premise of an evil ultra-modern house the locations and cinematography and set decoration and wardrobe. 
 A prison cell.Four prisoners-Carrere a young company director accused of fraud 35 year old transsexual in the process of his transformation Daisy a 20 year-old mentally challenged idiot savant and Lassalle a 60 year-old intellectual who murdered his wife.Behind a stone slab in the cell mysteriously pulled loose they discovered a book:the diary of a former prisoner Danvers who occupied the cell at the beginning of the century.The diary contains magic formulas that supposedly enable prisoners to escape. Malefique is one of the creepiest and most intelligent horror films I have seen this year.The film has a grimy shadowy feel influenced by the works of H.P. Lovecraft which makes for a very creepy and unsettling atmosphere.There is a fair amount of gore involved with some imaginative and brutal death scenes and the characters of four prisoners are surprisingly well-developed.It's a shame that Eric Valette made truly horrible remake of One Missed Call after his stunning debut.9 out of 10. 
 If you like CB4 you have no idea what you're missing if you haven't seen this film yet. This movie is crazy hilarious and incorporates a lot more about the hip hop industry than any other parody movie... It is unfortunate that this movie has not been released on dvd because it is one movie that everybody I've ever watched it with has loved and wanted a copy. If you really want a good laugh and you like hip hop and are a little familiar with some old-school performers definitley rent this movie. There aren't that many video rental places that have copies of it but if you happen to come across one you will not be disappointed. 
 The Thief of Baghdad is one of my ten all-time favorite movies. It is exciting without gore it is beautifully filmed and the art direction is flawless. The casting couldn't have been better. Rex Ingram made me believe in genies. And the epitome of evil is certainly captured by Conrad Veight as Jafar. He set the bar very high. ..I watch this movie at least twice a year...and never tire of it. This film is an adventure for all ages..no-one too old to enjoy it. The Thief of Bahgdad jogs my memories to a more innocent time...I was ten years old the first time I saw it and the U.S. was just about to enter WWII. Conrad Vieght was such a great actor that he was able to continue this underlying evilness a few years later in Casablanca. And Korda teamed up I believe with Justin and Dupree again in The Four Feathers ....great film-making! 
 Paulie is a fantasy of a littler girl or perhaps her recollection of what her youth was like growing up. Tony Shaloub executes a flawless performance as an Russian Scientist (PhD) who cannot find decent work in America. He befriends an isolated parrot while performing meanial duties of a janitor at a behavioral science lab. The chief Doctor is a bitter man as Paulie who can speak and fully comprehend language and learn embarasses the Doctor who later banishses him to the lower levels of the building where Mikail (Tony S.) finds him. Paulie recants his life with Marie and how they lost each other. The quest begins to reunite Paulie with Marie only more than 20 years has passed. The movie ends some will say predictably with Mikail reuniting Paulie with Marie. The story closes with the three entering Marie's home where you can make the final your own choice. Great family film! 
 Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh steal the show here. Cage and Boyle are fine but what gives this neo-noir its juice is Hopper's creepy violent character and JT Walsh's sneakiness. A drifter gets mistaken for a hit-man and tries to make a little dough out of it but gets in over his head. I found a strange parallel in the opening scene of this movie when Cage walks into a trailer in Wyoming to get drilling work with the help of his buddy...and the opening scene in Brokeback Mountain when the character does the same thing! But that's another story. Dennis Hopper is at his best here...cocky one-step-ahead villainous seething and explosively violent. JT Walsh (RIP) is also great as the man with a dark past trying to live legitimately (well almost). There are only 4 real characters of note here with the exception of the hard-working deputy in the town of Red Rock Wyoming. The first twist hits early on and from there it's a nice neo-noir adventure in some sleepy little town. Satisfying. 8 pts. 
 Well I had seen They all laughed when it came out in Europe around 1982 and had kept a vague but dear souvenir of it. I 've just seen it again on tape almost twenty years after... Bogdanovich has a true heartfelt tenderness over his characters and a kind sympathy which is difficult not to feel also. Excellent comedians and actors good lines all over and for everyone and pretty good editing too. I laughed and smiled all the time. Just as we all do at times. Go get it. 
 Meryl Streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous Lindy Chamberlain who was accused and tried for allegedly killing her own baby Azaria Chamberlain and using her alibi of ravenous dingoes as her defense. Based on the book Evil Angels and titled so in its Australian release A CRY IN THE DARK is an ugly film to watch. It presents a scenario that's all too real for us in America: the witch-hunt against a person deemed an easy target. Lindy Chamberlain was this woman. Being someone who spoke her mind someone who didn't play the sympathy card and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she didn't kill her own child. The media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece. And through it all Lindy remained as stoic as ever even when her husband Michael was falling apart. This stance of course is the power of strength as unsympathetic as it may look like and people happen to react strongly to that. They want to see a distressed mother cry and weep and occasionally faint at every turn not sit there and look blank. People don't understand that not everyone grieves the same way and when someone decides to stand strong they begin speculations. Meryl Streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold but not unfeeling woman one that stood by her convictions even if they cost her liberty. Because of her Sam Neill is allowed to have his character slowly dissolve into despair -- someone has to or the Chamberlains would be too detached and no one wants to see that. Except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the news-media. They'll always eat train wrecks up and feed the mangled manure to the uninformed public. 
 I've read a number of reviews on this film and I have to say What is wrong with you people?!?! This was an excellent film! I thought this film was superb from start to finish and the story was extremely well told. I'm convinced that the people that didn't like this film weren't paying very good attention to the film. There are a number of very important scenes that if you aren't paying attention you will be confused and the following scenes may not make sense. I urge anyone who didn't like this film to watch it again and watch it alone so that you can truly pay attention. The story made perfect sense to me and as I said was very well told. Every scene in the film has a point and everything fits together at the end of the film. All the actors did a fantastic job! Sean Connery was very good in his role as always. Laurence Fishburne was superb as Tanny Brown playing a very interesting character. Kate Capshaw was a nice touch as well and looks fantastic. Blair Underwood was a pleasant surprise I didn't really expect anything great from him but he pulled off a great performance. Ed Harris was the real gem in the film. He plays a truly sick individual and really makes you see how disturbed his character is. Watch his eyes in his scenes just superb!!! Also there is a very young Scarlett Johansson (as Kate) in one of her first roles...not a bad place to start. Excellent cast in this film! I would strongly recommend this film to anyone that likes any of the cast members or just likes thrillers. This is a great film and should be seen. Don't listen all these other people's opinions go see the movie and come to your own conclusions. I hope that you will see the film and I hope that you enjoy it as much as I do. Thanks for reading -Chris 
 As soon as I knew Keira Knighteley being in this flick I said I have to watch this movie . She's the undisputed main character Domino a bounty hunter. Her job as the no action scenes would teach us reflects her rebel violent attitude to life. I have to admit that it's the very first time that I watch an action movie whose most important scenes are the one in which the guns are far away from characters' hands. So this stomped me a bit. Anyway for all the John Woo's fans there are helicopters falling down explosions gunfire as if it would rain and a lovely Keira that shoots with two machine guns one per hand. The cast is absolutely brilliant. Going beyond Keira which in this movie is a real tomboy pretty much different from the lovely action figure we're used to see Mickey Rourke is back with his usual slap-throwing face and his potent body. Christopher Walken makes his job pretty well as a reality show producer. Let's go to the contents: this movie has a journalistic shape. The talk show scene is disgustingly real. Anyone that watched that load of . . . you-know-what can tell that this is the air that you breath in those situations. As well as the producer when Domino's mom says that the reality that should show Domino's life is trash; no offense he answers I don't take it like an offense . This movie portrays a difficult life. Domino coming from a world that didn't want her Ed (Mickey Rourke) a bounty hunter not so bounty Choco (the third guy of the band) which family is (using Ed's words) the correctional institutes he's been and Alf the driver/bomber coming from Afghanistan during the Russian occupation. This bunch of people represents in some way the humankind born without the shirt ; unlucky violent and with nothing to lose excepts their (as they would consider) miserable lives. The intro of the movie says that it is inspired by true story . . . more or less so I couldn't possibly tell you how much of this stuff is true. Anyway going beyond explosions and dozens of weapons (which could have been added to make the film easier to see and be classified as an action movie) the characters' story is too realistic to be edulcorated . The interaction between the characters is various well studied and definitely not boring. What hasn't convinced me so much is the role of the psychiatrist (Lucy Liu sober as never in her acting career). It represents only the reason by which Domino starts telling her story (and that's a story). Probably the only con in a movie with a lot of pros . All in all: This isn't SWAT . The characters are crafted; they have an identity a shape. They have a name and a surname (not just Gamble and Street ). It's the case to say it's the biography of a girl whose life went as fast as a bullet. 
 Thankfully as a student I have been able to watch Diagnosis Murder for a number of years now. It is basically about a doctor who solves murders with the help of his LAPD son a young doctor and a pathologist. DM provided 8 seasons of exceptional entertainment. What made it different from the many other cop shows and worth watching many times over was its cast and quality of writing. The main cast gave good performances and Dick Van Dyke's entertainer roots shone through with the use of magic dance and humor. The best aspects of DM was the fast pace witty scripts and of course the toe tapping score. Sadly it has been unfairly compared to Murder She Wrote . DM is far superior boasting more difficult mysteries to solve and more variety. Now it is gone TV is a worse place. Gone are the days of feelgood family friendly cop shows. Now there is just depressing 'gritty' ones. 
 The Running Man is often dismissed as being just another Arnie action thriller full of explosions bad puns and gunfire and to be fair there is a lot of that in it. People used to look at it and compare it to the Terminator series saying it was one of the poorer Schwarzenegger films. But give it 18 years and you find yourself being able to appreciate it in a different light. Rather than just being another brainless action film it works very well as a parody of reality TV. It is quite different to the Stephen King book true but I doubt whether Hollywood with its love of upbeat endings and so-called 'ordinary guys' who turned out to have the skills of a trained commando would have accepted it in its current form. But on with the review. Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a cop working in a dystopian United States where democracy is a thing of the past and the entire country is ruled by a government/media conglomerate amalgamation. The economy is in tatters food is scarce and the state keeps people distracted by producing sadistic gameshows for them to watch like Jumping for Dollars where people jump for money over a pit of rabid dogs and the most popular one is The Running Man a gameshow hosted by the slimy Damian Killian (played by the entertaining Richard Dawson) where supposed 'criminals' are hunted down by theatrical pro-wresting-esquire 'stalkers'. Some however try and speak up against the government. When a group of hungry people hold a protest in the town of Bakersfield California a helicopter piloted by Richards is sent to 'calm' (i.e. kill) the protest. When Richards refuses to fire on innocent people he is arrested and framed for the murder of the people in the crowd. He is sentenced to a slave labour camp but escapes with the aid of a resistance leader (Yaphet Kotto) and goes on the run. However his freedom does not last long and after he kidnaps network employee Amber Mendez (Marita Conchita Alonso) in an attempt to escape those pursuing him he finds himself taken prisoner again but this time he is forced to appear on The Running Man. And there of course the entire film kicks into standard Arnie mode. Richards is launched into the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Los Angeles (why is LA always destroyed in these dystopian worlds?) and forced to run from the 'stalkers' along with two other prisoners who escaped from the labour camp with him. Amber also becomes curious about Richards' protestations of innocence and discovers he was framed. Guess what happens to her then? So as Amber Richards and the two other guys run around trying to avoid the stalkers we soon become aware that Richards is no ordinary cop. He's Super Arnie the unkillable one man army who can collapse evil corporate dictatorships and fight obese men covered in Christmas lights all while being just your average American guy with an Austrian accent. Yes the remainder of the film becomes dumb loud classic 80's Arnie fun. There's a lot of exciting fight sequences the trademark dreadful puns ('He had to split' being my favourite) and the general formulaic final confrontation and happy ending. It's a lot of fun watching Killian react to it in the typical 'wholesome' gameshow host way as well and some of the funniest moments in the show revolve around the contrast between his interactions with the crowd as the seemingly benevolent host (watch out for the cursing old lady!) and the cold cyncial man he is in reality who will do anything to increase ratings. If you expect a high-brow intelligent film you'll be disappointed. But if you want a great 80s flick well this is it. But the great thing about this film is it was quite prophetic. If you look at the entertainment we have today you'll have noticed the way reality TV is going nowadays - shows featuring people willing to put themselves through anything for five minutes of fame and producers all too willing to let them humiliate themselves on TV. It's not too far a leap to imagine that some vile TV exec out there has been trying to get the right to show people be executed live on TV. We've already had that however with the ghoulish al-Qaida hostage beheading videos posted on the internet. It seems that in the current climate at least some people are perfectly fine with watching real death on their television sets. With that in mind and coupled with the fact that everything these days appears to be a revival of the 80s you have to be impressed by the far-sightedness of this film. Of course we haven't reached there yet as it's terrorists rather than the mainstream media who have bought us easily available programs featuring real human death but you just have to wonder how long it is before some exec decides to see if he can find a way of pitching a show that combines people's desire for entertainment and desire to indulge their morbid curiosity... 
 Anthony McGarten has adapted his play Via Satellite and directed the best comedic film to come out of New Zealand for a long time. Chrissy Dunn (Danielle Cormack) is a drop-out. She hasn't achieved much in her latter years and has grown resentful of her family since her father's deathbed confession. Her twin sister Carol (also portrayed by Danielle Cormack) is basking in the media limelight as she represents New Zealand in swimming at the Olympics. A middle-aged desireless and desperate director (Brian Sergent) and his good-natured cameraman - who is also Chrissy's one-night stand from the night previous - Paul (Karl Urban) film the Dunn family's proudest moment; watching Carol swim to victory. This wouldn't be so bad but Chrissy's family is the epitome of embarrassing. First of all there is the matriach of the Wellingtonian Dunns Joyce (Donna Akerston). She makes fairy cakes and cocktail sausages for the all-important film crew and refuses to change the way she is. Her oldest daughter Jen (Rima Te Wiata) is desperate to be something more than common. She has a nice home (with bedroom walls painted Blackberry sorbet ) expensive tastes and a nasty parasitic attitude to match. She is also nearing 40 and desparate for a child. Her husband Ken (Tim Balme) is an electrician and forces himself on jobs that don't need doing...as well as doing jobs that need to be done ie Jen. The middle daughter Lyn (Jodie Dorday - who won Best Supporting Actress at New Zealand Film Awards for this portrayal)is a knocked-up tart who has a dubious history with Ken. Both older sisters clash the mother is in a state Ken is as bad a ToolTime Tim Taylor Carol is fuelling her Olympic desire and Chrissy is aware all of this is to be splashed on national tv - why shouldn't she be embarrassed? It is great to see some famous New Zealand faces perform in the suburban comedy that has witty lines to spare. I loved the sparring between Jen and Lyn. One is like an adult Mona-my-biological-clock-is-ticking-away the other a narcisstic tramp who has what her sister desires - a bun in the oven. Climax of the film is quite sentimental and is nicely done. The performances are a treat and the film works perfectly. A great way to spend an hour-and-a-half. 
 ''Ranma ? is my favorite anime by Rumiko Takahashi. The woman really knows how to entertain us with a good story that is not only a comedy but also an action anime. The main character of the story is Ranma Saotome a teenager boy who is also an expert in martial arts. Ranma is engaged to Akane because of an arrangement of both fathers who are great friends and trained together during many years. Akane is the younger and most violent sister of the Tendo's: Kasumi is the oldest and is very sweet and Nabiki is the middle and loves to win money no matter what. Ranma and Akane fight all the time specially because both have a very bad temper and when they discover that Ranma becomes a girl when splashed with cold water as well as his father becomes a panda many new characters and situations starts to happen. They also discover the reason of the transformation: while fighting Ranma and his father fell in a cursed river. But not only them had this kind of fate... If you watched ''Ranma 1/2'' and liked I would recommend you ''Inuyasha'' and ''Maison Ikkoku two other good creations from Rumiko's hands. 
 Like Ishtar and King of Comedy other great misunderstood comedies Envy has great performances by two actors playing essentially losers (may be too harsh a word I will call them suburban under-achievers). This film was a dark comedy gem and I'm not sure what people expect. I relish seeing a major studio comedy that isn't filled with obvious humor and I believe that the small moments in this movie make it worthwhile. The look on Stiller's face when he sees the dog doo disappear for the first time captures a moment a moment that most people should be able to recognize in themselves. Yes it was a fairly simple story but it examined the root of envy in a really interesting way. There were a lot of great scenes (the J-Man's decrepit cabin by the lake Corky's unceremonious burial Weitz's wife role and Walken's J-Man -- all great stuff. I can't stand people that get on IMDb and mercilessly trash films when they have absolutely no idea what it takes to make one. I will take Envy over almost any of the top ten grossing comedies of the year (save Napoleon Dynamite.) It's wittier wackier and an offbeat enjoyable gem. Remember this people; Most times Popular doesn't equal Good. 
 Pearl S.Buck was a brilliant author that was a first American lady won Nobel prize in literature in 1938 and received her prize with Enrico Fermi an Italian Physit. She wrote this romance in 1931 which was a second one after her first novel (East wind and West wind) in 1930 and her beginning in literature was fantastic upon her premier novels. she won in 1935 (Pulitzer prize) in literature on her eternal novel (The good earth) which made a brilliant panorama on the life of Chinese peasant (Wung Lung) and his wife (O-Lane) and their efforts to face the hardness of hard positions in their earth to reach for their big fortune by their shoulders. Paul Muni succeeded in this role as Chinese peasant that he prepared himself in this role upon his sittings with Chinese people in San Francisco in their town to be Chinese exactly as a real and true. Shara Reiner succeeded in her role as (O-Lane) by this brilliant evidence that she won An Academy Awarded as a best actress in 1937. 
 In the hands of lesser actors than Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan this film could have become silly and trite. But with these two experienced thespians leading the way I found Silent Fury to be a most exciting and pleasurable little mystery. When their wedding is interrupted by a stranger who claims that Colbert is already married and that he was best man at that wedding one can sense that there is some sort of plot against her at work. As Colbert Ryan and her attorney set out to disprove the strangers claim of a prior marriage they are met at every turn by more evidence that seems to reinforce the claim that she is indeed already wed. Although it's not very difficult to figure out just who the main baddie is it's still lots of fun as the intensity and pace of the story increases. All in all a good solid mystery film with fine performances by the two leading actors and a fine supporting cast which includes the often underrated Paul Kelly. 
 Two years ago I watched The Matador in cinema and I loved everything about this movie. Obviously I was totally under impression of Pierce Brosan's magnificent role. Yesterday I caught this movie again on TV so I looked at it a bit deeper. Now I can say with certain that this movie isn't that special but you just gotta' love it because of one man. Brosnan lifts its grade up in my opinion with amazing performance of Julian Noble tired hit-man who has no friends. Soon Julian meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico City man who's got bad luck: his son died in accident his job isn't going that well and he's not sure that he can keep his wife Bean (Hope Davis). I always liked movies like this; crime movie with big touch of humor. Mostly that humor comes from Brosnan as he tells jokes about dwarfs with big d.... or one of my favorite lines in this movie: I look like a Bangkok hooker on a Sunday morning after the navy's left town. Brosnan says it with his charm while he's drinking his margarita as usually. I also like Greg 'typical American face' Kinnear in the role of loser that is very lively made because there are plenty of people like Danny Wright. So I recommend you to watch quite possibly the best role of Brosnan ever. He'll make you smile and admire him at the same time. Great Brosnan in not equally great movie. 
 Coming from the same director who'd done Candyman and Immortal Beloved I'm not surprised it's a good film. Ironically Papierhaus is a movie I'd never heard of until now yet it must be one of the best movies of the late 80s - partly because that is hands down the worst movie period in recent decades. (Not talking about Iranian or Swedish cinema here...) The acting is not brilliant but merely solid - unlike what some people here claim (they must have dreamt this wondrous acting much like Anna). The story is an interesting fantasy that doesn't end in a clever way that ties all the loose ends together neatly. These unanswered questions are probably left there on purpose leaving it up to the individual's interpretation and there's nothing wrong with that with a theme such as this. Pepperhaus is a somewhat unusual mix of kids' film and horror with effective use of sounds and music. I like the fact that the central character is not your typical movie-clich¨¦ ultra-shy-but-secretly-brilliant social-outcast girl but a regular normal kid; very refreshing. I am sick and tired of writers projecting their own misfit-like childhoods into their books and onto the screens as if anyone cares anymore to watch or read about yet another miserly lonely childhood as if that's all there is or as if that kind of character background holds a monopoly on good potential. The scene with Anna and the boy snogging (for quite a stretch) was a bit much - evoking feelings of both vague disgust and amusement - considering that she was supposed to be only 11 but predictably it turned out that Burke was 13 or 14 when this was filmed. I have no idea why they didn't upgrade the character's age or get a younger actress. It was quite obvious that Burke isn't that young. Why directors always cast kids older than what they play hence dilute the realism I'll never know. 
 Demonicus is a movie turned into a video game! I just love the story and the things that goes on in the film.It is a B-film ofcourse but that doesn`t bother one bit because its made just right and the music was rad! Horror and sword fight freaks buy this movie now! 
 Two snipers travel deep in the jungles in search for their targets; a slimy South American drug-lord and a prominent general. Moderately successful at building a brooding atmosphere Sniper is by most accounts a very solid thriller taking it's time establishing it's characters and their plight and climaxing in some good action sequences. Director Llosa isn't always successful at maintaining the sombre mood and could have tightened the story somewhat; some detours here don't add up to much. But this film is far better than his Stallone/Stone travesty The Specialist. Billy Zane usually incredibly tiresome does surprisingly well as the inexperienced Sniper teamed up with veteran Berenger. As for Berenger this film proved to be his last good big budget Hollywood venture. He can do these kind of roles in his sleep and he's very convincing here reprising the role twice more in direct to DVD sequels. 
 (No spoilers just plot details) I can't understand such hatred for this episode. You want to watch a bad episode of Smallville? Watch Subterranean - now there's a sack of crap. Tom Welling gives a good performance (I don't say that very often) and Michael Rosenbaum is great but he is most of the time. The alternate universe scenario seems eerily realistic. The Martian Manhunter who previously appeared in Static returns and tells Clark that the doctor that is the head of the insane asylum where they are being held at is actually a phantom from the phantom zone and if Clark wants to return to his universe he must kill him. An overall great episode with good acting and a decent pace. 
 Sequel to The Kingdom is bloodier and even more twisted. I only saw half (I was exhausted and couldn't sit through all 5 1/2 hours) but I loved what I saw. Ghosts blood murder poisoning mutated babies voodoo...this has it all! If you have a strong stomach and like weird movies this is for you. Also you don't have to see Part 1 to understand this...you'll figure it out! Does anyone know if Kingdom 1 and 2 are available on DVD? Sitting through these marathon movies in a theatre is tiring. Sadly there probably won't be a Kingdom 3 --Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (Sig) died a year after this was filmed. But you never know! 
 It appears that there's no middle ground on this movie! Most of it takes place in a dream and like most dreams it's often foolish and illogical. It's also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances especially by our angel. Jeanette's deadpan unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are hilarious and her jitterbug with Binnie Barnes is a surprise and a delight. At one point she gets to sing a snippet from Carmen followed by the final trio of Faust (holding a lapdog for some strange reason) then Aloha Oe on the beach! It's a surreal comedy--tremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove. 
 I watched this film so many times through my child hood that even to this day i can pretty much re-sight all of the dialogue. And when I watch it now it just makes me happy and surprisingly still laugh. I think it's amazing how they managed to train animals especially the cat to the extent that they are able to play the main role of a feature film. However watching it now I can also unfortunately notice that it isn't the masterpiece i once thought it was. But i prefer to remember how i felt about it when i was younger watching it on VHS on my fist TV that would cloud the image in yellow. And and bearing in mind it is a children's film that is why i would still definitely give it 10/10. 
 And Gi Joe go stuck in the water I die of laufther every time I see this movie and then a big brown shark came This is comedy at it's best this blows away the kings of comedy and anyone else Andrew Dice Clay Jerry Tucker Rock They can't thouch the man the myth the legend Eddie Murphy Yo EDDIE WE WANT MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 This movie is really funny!! The General is Keaton's finest work but there are many of his works that are more hilarious - in this one are multiple sight gags and creative humor. We watch it over and over and it only seems to get funnier! 
 Although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and adventure still is special. If you've never seen this film before you'll be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers. I was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much Disney's Aladdin cribbed from the film. They loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a touchstone for so many other films and film makers. I've given the film an 8 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of ten which is where a good portion of this film dwells because in the final 15 minutes the film falls apart in the pacing. Everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end. From the point from the departure of the djinn to the end it appears to be more sketch then finished painting. It doesn't kill the film but it does weaken it. Still its required viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale or even a great movie. 
 -The movie tells the tale of a prince whose life is wonderful but after an evil wizard tells him to go into town disguised as a beggar the wizard then locks up the prince and soon becomes the shadow ruler of Baghdad. the jailed prince meets a thief called Abu who helps him escape the jail and head to a town called Basra where he meets a princess who he falls madly in love with but unbeknown to him the evil wizard Jafa is also in love with the princess and tries to convince her father to allow him to marry her. Jafa soon learns that the prince is trying to win the girls heart so he makes him blind and turns Abu into a dog. This leads to the prince and Abu going off on an adventure to find a way to defeat Jafa restore peace to Baghdad and marry the princess. during their journey they encounter everything from sarcastic Genies that takes Abu on a flight through the clouds a giant spider that's really hungry and a flying horse that probably gives birth to one of the most beautiful sequence these old eyes of mine have ever seen. -This is a pure fantasy movie from start to finish it has flying horses genies flying carpets and wizards that can actually do magic instead of just hit people with their staffs. It doesn't have any cheesy moments and the love story isn't a waste of time. The production designs are just stunning in this movie. From the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter. Even though this movie is over 40 years old the production design is far better than most of the crap that gets tacked on in today's cinema. The music and songs are also well done. Anyone who sees it will no doubt hail I want to be a sailor sailing on the seas as one of the great musical moments in movies. I'm usually not a huge fan of singing in movies since I find them about as enjoyable as doing my taxes but I'll be more than happy to make an exception for this movie. -What sells the movie for me is the sheer fact that you get to see things you don't see in everyday life which is also the same reason why I love stuff like Two Towers and Silent Hill . Way before today's modern fantasy movie came along with their realistic CGI to blow our minds there was this movie which blew your mind without having green screen scattered all over the place. One of my favorite shots in Two Towers is the one where we see the trolls opening the Black Gates the main appeal of that shot for me was seeing these great fantasy beings doing what is essentially manual labor and that's what I love about the Genie and other creatures in the movie. They're just there trying to make a living just like everyone else which gives them a real feel even though they're all just fantasy beings. -It's literally impossible to watch this movie and not notice where the makers of Aladdin got their inspiration. The characters from this movie are pretty much the same characters in that movie from the talkative Genie right down to the flying carpet. It's not an entirely bad thing in my eyes since it's nice to know that I'm not the only one on the planet that has a deep passionate love for this amazing movie. I first saw this as a kid in the motherland and thought it was the greatest thing in the world and upon watching it again last week I still think it's amazing. That's a true testament that a great movie can withstand the test of time. Sure the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the 40's so give it a break. Not everything looks outdated though since most of the stuff can still hold its own today when scrutinized under today's standard. -If you ever wanted to see a live action version of Aladdin then you should get your wish with this but the angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this won't be their cup of tea. 
 It's nothing brilliant groundbreaking or innovative but 'Dog Days' is for some reason an extremely fascinating character study. It's like CRASH tripping on a bad dose of heroin but not really. It's an Austrian film following the lives of several depressed deranged and annoying people and their abusive relationships with each other. It's disturbing yet very well-acted and it's interesting to watch the crazy little things these characters do. Certainly not for the weak-hearted this highly pessimistic film offers no conclusion or revelation at the end we just see the lives of these sordid individuals over the course of two days. Grade: B 
 Sometimes they get lucky and have a hit on their hands (Wayne's World the first one not the second). But most often they have duds (It's Pat comes to mind rather quickly). This time out it's Tim Meadows as The Ladies Man. This movie falls somewhere in between a hit and a dud. It was very funny for the first 20 minutes but then as usually happens with SNL skits it starts to slow down before finally ending long after it should have. Tim Meadows is Leon Phelps a radio DJ with a nightly show called The Ladies Man. He answers any and all questions dealing with sex and relationships usually in the crudest way possible. Everything seems to ultimately come down to the butt. After pushing the buttons of the station manager Leon along with his producer Julie (Karyn Parsons) gets fired and needs to find another job. Out of the random blue comes a letter from one of his ex-ladies. The letter offers him wealth and luxury for the rest of his life the only problem being that the letter isn't signed. So Leon needs to track down all the women he's been with to find the woman of his dreams. But sometimes as Billy Dee Williams says in the film the woman of your dreams is standing right in front of you. There is also a sub-plot about a bunch of guys who's wives/girlfriends have all slept with Leon and they want to first figure out who he is (by a tattoo he has on a part of his anatomy) then kill him. Leading this bunch of guys is surprise! Will Ferrell from SNL. First off I thought the sub-plot was rather lame. The singing and dancing stuff was just completely worthless. I usually like Will Ferrell but here he just never clicked for me. And the rest of the guys were just schlubs who tagged along and in the end all decided that having their wives/girlfriends cheat on them was in fact their fault. So back to the main story. The story basically centers around Leon and sex. So what it comes down to is if you don't like the character of Leon you won't like the movie. His voice his mannerisms his dialogue is what carries the movie. I am not a big fan of Tim Meadows. I never thought he was a particularly good actor on SNL. The only thing I ever really liked of his was his Ladies Man skits. But the best thing about those is that they usually involved the guest host (remember the one with Cameron Diaz?) and they were short. For about 5 minutes they were pretty funny. And here for about 20 minutes it's really funny. What I thought was good about the character in the movie is that he stayed in character throughout. He never wavered from his wanted to just get laid persona. Until right at the end where there was this transformation and the ever present speech to tie things up. Other than that it was pretty good at keeping Leon as Leon and not changing him into something less crude than he was. There isn't a lot of substance to this movie if you couldn't guess. But like I said earlier the beginning of the movie I found to be very funny. Some real laugh out loud moments all revolving around sex and his crudeness. The problem of course with this movie and most other SNL spin offs is that these are characters that are only supposed to be shown for a few minutes at a time. Stretching the concept into 80 minutes is very difficult. That difficulty is obviously why they needed the sub-plot because without it this movie would have been a little under an hour. When it was good it was good but when it wasn't good it got to be boring. So overall The Ladies Man wasn't as bad as other SNL films but it wasn't as good as others. It had some funny moments the first 20 minutes was pretty good but the rest of it dragged on. There was an unnecessary sub-plot whose only purpose was to lengthen the film. The bottom line is if you like Tim Meadows and his Leon Phelps character you'll be able to watch the film. If he annoys you don't even bother going. Unless you just want to see Tiffani Theissen in some nice revealing clothing. 
 This is sad this movie is the tops this should at least be in the top 250 movies here. This is still the best Action movie ever done. The action movies of today are badly done The actors and action directors do not no how to do it fighting and stunts properly. only some no how to do it mostly from Hong Kong like Jackie Chan. The stunts are so clever and wild i do not think we will see the likes of ever. The start where Chan and his team go down the hill car chase through the hill town is just amazing. The end fight stunts are for me the best fight stunts ever put to film. The end stunt sliding down the pole crashing through the glass Jackie was badly hurt. 
 I love playing football and I thought this movie was great because it contained a lot of football in it. This was a good Hollywood/bollywood film and I am glad it won 17 awards. Parminder Nagra and Kiera Knightley were good and so was Archie Punjabi. Jonathon Rheyes Meyers was great at playing the coach. Jazz (Parminder Nagra) loves playing football but her parents want her to learn how to cook an want her to get married. When Jazz starts playing for a football team secretly she meets Juliet (Kiera Knightlety) and Joe (Jonathon Rhyes Meyers) who is her coach. When her parents find out trouble strikes but her dad lets her play the big match on her sisters Pinky (Archie Punjabi's) wedding. At the end her parents realise how much she loves football and let her go abroad to play. 
 Jackie Chan's classic directorial feature POLICE STORY (1985) is among the most influential and over-the-top modern day police actioners ever to come out from Hong Kong. Jackie wanted simply to make a movie which would include the usual kung fu and also fierce gun play and other urban action which would later become very popular and typical among HK directors like John Woo and Ringo Lam. POLICE STORY mixes these two action elements and styles and the result is as wild as it sounds. Jackie plays Chan Ka-Kui a police who gets to protect an important witness (Brigitte Lin) who would soon testify against a powerful gangster boss and his ring of criminal activity. Jackie's girlfriend is played by young and sweet Maggie Cheung who isn't as wild here as she would be in her subsequent roles like Heroic Trio (and the sequel) by Johnnie To Savior of the Soul by Corey Yuen and David Lai and many many others. The plot in POLICE STORY is very simple but it is the action why this film was made in the first place. Jackie did of course all the stunts of his character by himself and also hurt himself pretty badly in couple of scenes some of which are also in the completed movie like at the end in which Jackie hits his head (near the eye) through a very nasty looking sharp piece of glass. Also Jackie's stunt team members almost got themselves killed during filming of this film. The scene in which a bus stops right before Jackie spitting the kidnappers through the windshield went really bad as the bus stopped too early and the stuntmen didn't fly as they were supposed to. They were supposed to fly on the car parked in the front of the bus but their flight was too short and they hit through the asphalt with hospital level injuries. During the end credits there is a behind the scenes imagery and images of these injured actors and it all looks really bad and almost tasteless but fortunately no one got killed or injured too severely. The action is more than plentiful and imaginative as can be expected by (action) director Chan. The now legendary bus scene and shopping mall scene at then end are most likely among the wildest scenes any action film has been able to deliver. Jackie always tells how important editing is (which is true) and it really shows in his action scenes and their timing which is perfect and makes the films look so ultra kinetic when compared to Hollywood efforts for instance. There's hardly any slow moments here and also those moments are interesting and the film never becomes boring or hard to watch. But there is again one negative point which I cannot stand in HK action comedies which is this comedy itself. The comedy isn't funny especially when the errors and amateurish elements in the screenplay aren't there by accident but because of the writer wanted to add them there without necessarily understanding that they are signs of bad script and stupid dialogue. I mean those scenes like the stabbing murder attempt at the beginning when the murderer just shouts and screams and makes faces and acts like a drunken clown from some slapstick nightmare and he is there to murder that girl. This kind of acting is stupid and inept and I wouldn't like to see it in a film which is otherwise very great in its own genre. Characters also speak their thoughts which is also a sign of bad script because those loud thoughts are there just to make things clear even for the stupidest viewer and thus making things way too simple and light. Even if the film is comic and not so serious these kind of stupidities should not be there and they cannot be forgiven too easily. POLICE STORY is a fast speed full impact balls to the walls action adventure miracle from Hong Kong and from the time when Jackie was very sad because of the bad result he got with the US produced The Protector as he didn't have the same thoughts about the film as director James Glickenhaus had and thus the result didn't please audiences and Jackie and he returned to Hong Kong to make more personal and inventive film. That he definitely did and the result is as wild today as it was back then in the 80's. This is among the most insane action films ever and it would be somewhat perfect without the flaws I mentioned. 7/10 
 First off let's start with the negative points: 1) There are HUGE gaping wholes in the story line and questions that are raised that will get no where near being answered; 2) The movie is not for all people so impolite viewers will get restless and start yapping during the movie. Point two above is important because the movie is very quiet. In an older type theater (like the one I went to) you can hear the reel going through the projector at times. I loved that. The movie does not keep you busy with music nor effects: it lets you reflect upon what is happening. There is a lack of rhythm that generates an atmosphere that is fascinating an utterly enjoyable. The same kind of atmosphere generated by Stanley Kubrick in Eyes Wide Shut. Not for all people. I would highly recommend it to fans of cinema as the cinematographic work is amazing. Those that base their appreciation of a movie solely on the story will be utterly disappointed. It's the kind of story that you have to make up the links in your mind afterwards. (My version of it is pretty darn cool but probably quite off-track!) If you do go catch the movie there is one very cool part: when the two cops are talking to each other on their cell phones. An ultra-cool sound effect that really puts you in the moment. Hats off to the person that thought of doing this. 
 I recently watched this but when it started I had no idea what the concept was about what the topic was.....in short - I had no idea what it was. Was it a documentary was it a comedy routine.....Well it was BOTH. It started a little slow but I think that's because I had absolutely no idea what type of program I was viewing. But it quickly sucked me in. The episode I watched had Robert Wuhl discussing fact and fiction in history. Mainly how we (american's) learn history that isn't really true - and how we got to learn what we did. He did this in such a way as to keep the viewer completely entertained and interested. I actually learned a few things and that is a true indicator of how effective this type of program can be. I would love to see this picked up as a series for HBO. I believe it can be just as fun and effective with a variety of topics - especially if they are taught in the same type of manner as this episode. 
 Brokedown Palace is truly a one of a kind. It's an amazing story showing two girl's plight for freedom against the Thailand justice system. They soon find themselves placing faith into a system they know nothing about. Alice Morano (Claire Danes) and Darlene Davis (Kate Beckinsale) are two best friends strait out of high school. They suddenly change their vacation plans from Hawaii to Thailand and are immediately captivated by a young man Nick Parks. He flirts with them both and suggests that the three of them go to Hong Kong for the weekend. When the two arrive at the airport they are immediately searched for drugs. Someone tipped off customs and in an instant their life is changed forever. In the mix of the confusion of settling into their new life they learn about a highly respected lawyer named Hank Green (Bill Pullman). An American who knows the Thai justice system he fights for the girl to be free. But they soon find out when they leave or go is all up to them. If you're looking for a great movie that'll stay with you for years - Brokedown Palace is definitely the way to go. 
 Yes some people have said that this movie was a waste of money but i'm the kind of die hard dragon/world-ending/holy crap action movie fan. But if you take it from my stand point this movie had some of the best action sences were pretty dang good. But its that kind of movie that everything just fell tougher at the right time or just about when evil was trumph something fell in to save them at the right time. Though there were some funny lines and gangs throughout the movie which surprised me. The 3d graphics were pretty damn good. I mean for this kind of movie the 3d effects were GREAT!!!! Big battle that was shown in the trailers live up to whatever hype the movie had. The fight between good and evil at the end was I have to to say could have been longer and slightly better it was still pretty good. Now on to the parts that i think could have been better. The beginning was pretty good showing the parts that lead up to the big battles. I mean if you don't really want to go see this movie in theaters then at least this is a DVDer... overall i loved the movie but the plot just fell into place to fast and fit tougher just to well. 
 It'd be easy to call Guys and Dolls great. It's got Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando (and contrary to Sinatra's original wishes the casting works) it's got a really cool 1950s feel even if it is basically transposed from stage to screen with only a little interruption. And most of the songs are often a lot of fun and catchy and performed with that wink and nod to the wonderful escapism inherent in the form itself. If it's not entirely as great as some others of its ilk it shouldn't be any fault of the filmmaker Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Not all the songs entirely click and a little of the dialog feels like it's being performed for the stage as opposed to film (it's hard to tell at times- Brando and Sinatra straddle the line so often that one has to watch carefully to tell when one plays for the camera or for the stage while the actress playing Adele is better for stage than screen). The plot is one of those winners that works well for its period even if one wonders if its influence has stretched to the likes of 1999's She's All That (well not quite but close). A gambler (and 14-year betrothed) played by Sinatra wants to host a big-time game but is told that the heat is on meaning the cops are on watch. So he has only one choice to host the game with a thousand dollar tab. The only way he can get it is through a big-time bet with fellow gambler Brando who's put on to make a wild wooing job of a mission worker. It allows for the predictable twists in the story in the sudden turn-on-turn-off of the charms of the character of the idiosyncrasies of people from the streets (gangsters and dancers and the saitn played by Jean Simmons who falls for Brando). It is in its basic concept about this whole world of guys and dolls and how to balance one or the other- obviously without getting married or too compromised. Mankiewicz brings a lot of energy to the piece even when keeping still with the camera on the subject and his stars are properly reeled in. Hell even Brando works excellently for a musical as he goes beyond being simply THE method actor and shows his chops for singing and big-star quality. The story and characters eventually wind down to what you'd hope will happen and that's fine. All we ask for- and what we get- is entertainment in good spurts of witty involving dialog and a few songs and dances that bring the house down (my favorites were the number with the lady-cats at the club Luck be a Lady and the two numbers down in Havana Cuba). A- 
 In the colonies we're not all that familiar with Arthur Askey so I nearly skipped this film (which had its TCM preview recently) on account of the negative comments here on his appearance in Ghost Train -- which I expected to be thoroughly annoying. Instead I was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing audibly. The physical aspects of Askey's comedy and his timing when delivering a line suggest what you'd get if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen had a baby. There is no comparing him to Bud Abbott or any of the other usual purveyors of comic relief who turn up in films of this genre. One can feel moreover the thread connecting Askey to British comedy 30 years later; at least it is clear from an American point of view that he has more in common with the Monty Python troupe than with any of his counterparts over here. As for the rest of the film -- the more movies you've seen the more likely you'll guess at the ending but it is still quite entertaining and atmospheric and worth waiting for its next appearance. 
 First things first Edison Chen did a fantastic believable job as a Cambodian hit-man born and bred in the dumps and a gladiatorial ring where he honed his craft of savage battery in order to survive living on the mantra of kill or be killed. In a role that had little dialogue or at least a few lines in Cambodian/Thai his performance is compelling probably what should have been in the Jet Li vehicle Danny the Dog where a man is bred for the sole purpose of fighting and on someone else's leash. Like Danny the Dog the much talked about bare knuckle fight sequences are not choreographed stylistically but rather designed as normal brutal fisticuffs where everything goes. This probably brought a sense of realism and grit when you see the characters slug it out at each other's throats in defending their own lives while taking it away from others. It's a grim gritty and dark movie both literally and figuratively and this sets it apart from the usual run off the mill cop thriller production. Edison plays a hired gun from Cambodia who becomes a fugitive in Hong Kong on the run from the cops as his pickup had gone awry. Leading the chase is the team led by Cheung Siu-Fai who has to contend with maverick member Inspector Ti (Sam Lee) who's inclusion and acceptance in the team had to do with the sins of his father. So begins a cat and mouse game in the dark shades and shadows of the seedier looking side of Hong Kong. The story itself works on multiple levels especially in the character studies of the hit-man and the cop. On opposite sides of the law we see within each character not the black and white but the shades of grey. With the hit-man we see his caring side when he got hooked up and developed feelings of love for a girl (Pei Pei) bringing about a sense of maturity tenderness and revealing a heart of gold. The cop with questionable tactics and attitudes makes you wonder how one would buckle when willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. There are many interesting moments of moral questioning on how anti-hero despicable strategies are adopted. You'll ask what makes a man and what makes a beast and if we have the tendency to switch sides depending on circumstances - do we have that dark inner streak in all of us transforming from man to dog and dog to man? Dog Bite Dog grips you from the start and never lets go until the end though there are points mid way through that seemed to drag especially on its tender moments and it suffered too from not knowing when to end. If I should pick a favourite scene then it must be the one in the market food centre - extremely well controlled and delivered a suspenseful edge of your seat moment. Listen out for the musical score too and you're not dreaming if you hear growls of dogs. Highly recommended especially if you think that you've seen about almost everything from the cop thriller genre. 
 It's a short movie from David Lynch with just 8 minutes but it got all the Lynchian ingredients ! It's mysterious dark inconclusive eerie and strange; and before the blond girl starts to talk it's even a bit scary! The soundtrack is exceptional to create this odd atmosphere because it's also sinister and mysterious? About the setting itself it hasn't the traditional red curtains but it has socking purple painted walls which give it an equally effect of eeriness. The plot is about a girl who's locked in a dark room and she cries for help; then comes another girl who starts talking to her in a mysterious way saying she's there just because of her fault? We don't know what did happen or what will happen next? it ended unsolved and puzzling as a good Lynch movie must end! It's a great short despite some amateurish acting. The girls are professional actresses but I think their acting could have been better in this short. 
 Overall I would have to say that I liked the movie. Some of the fight scenes are really good. Especially the fight against Leung Ka-Yan. One point that really bothered me was the fact that they used an Asian to play a black man. I mean really. Talk about bad taste. During a fight scene you see one of the fighters on the floor is laughing. Otherwise Sammo copies Bruce Lee's fighting moves perfectly. 5 out of 10 Stars. 
 Ronald Colman gives an electrifying performance as Tony John a Broadway actor who can't separate his offstage life from Shakespeare's Othello the character he plays on stage....Two important scenes illustrate Tony's dilemma. The first one takes place in producer Max Lasker's office. Acting is a matter of talent for the practical-minded Lasker. But Donlan Tony's friend disagrees: No no. When you do it like Tony does it it's much more. The way he has of becoming someone else every night...so completely. No don't tell me his whole system isn't affected by it. ....The other scene occurs in waitress Pat Kroll's apartment. Tony tells her his name is Martin. She thanks him. Then he says: Or Paul. Hamlet. Joe. And maybe Othello. ....When Tony begins rehearsing Othello we learn that though he's trying to keep his real life separated from his stage life The part begins to seep into your life and the battle begins. Reality against imagination. He can't keep the two separated: In his mind Pat is Desdemona and he's Othello and he wrongly believes she has been unfaithful to him. He murders her....Colman's bravura performance in a complex and difficult role earned him 1947's Academy Award for Best Actor. Oscar nominations went to Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin for Best Original Screenplay. Not to be overlooked is Milton Krasner's atomspheric cinematography. 
 The makers of this fine film did a terrific job of getting you involved with the characters as they suffered through this horrible ordeal.The horrific scene in the woods was done so superbly that you forget that these men were just actors playing parts.I have never gotten so immersed in a film as I have this one.Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight were never better on screen as well as fine performances by Ned Beatty Ronny Cox Bill McKinney and though he appeared only briefly James Dickey the man who authored the book upon which the film is based as the sheriff of Aintry.It is somewhat disturbing and kids of course should be shielded from it but this is great dramatic cinema. 
 I was pleased with the cast of reputable players. The story is one of standing up for a cause even if you are at personal risk in doing so. In a time where violence and pain are often in the movie forefront this movie focuses on the old fashioned good cop. Although similar plots have been done repeatedly these guys pull it off well. Kick back and enjoy. Dennehy is a master of taking over a movie. 
 Of course the story line for this movie isn't the best but the dances are wonderful. This story line is different from other Astaire-Rogers movies in that neither one is chasing the other. The dancing of Fred and Ginger is what makes this movie. 
 Loved the movie. Loved the two families crossing paths in history. Only question is if Sam gets killed then how does his family's line continue? He is Madame Zeroni's son and Zero is supposed to be related but no mention of any other children? Hmmmmmmmmm. Never mentioned any other children or wife prior to his speaking with and falling in love with the teacher? Maybe she had a child prior to becoming the kissing Kate Bandit? Even with the mistakes in the movie. Just loved it. The acting was great. Not sure where the story was with Mr. Sir being Marion a women at the end but makes his character even funnier. The other counseler did seem concerned for the kids but of course maybe not so much. Poor Warden must have had a really stinky childhood to be so mean when she grew up. 
 The Caprica episode (S01E01) is well done as a pilot. Really this episode is the exact same content as the DVD pilot release. That having been said episode 01 gives a very substantive background of the very popular Battlestar Galactica series (both the original and the 2007 remake). It significantly applies most to the 2007 series. As is the trending plots of sci-fi of late this series explores Virtual life or environment. On top of this we are given much background on the Adama family line as well as their relationship with the unrevealed (in the Battlestar Galactica series) creator of the Cylons. To the most part this first episode revolves around the popular topic of Virtual life and (as is expected) early life of the colonies and the birth of the Cylons. Over all I rather enjoyed this episode. Although it was not new material for myself or anyone that has already seen the DVD release of the Caprica pilot the series seems very promising. As is the case with many pilots episode 01 leaves us with a cliff-hanger so to ensure a follow by an audience (sci-fi community). I'm definitely going to keep watching for resolve as well as development. I give this series 8 stars. 
 As others have mentioned all the women that go nude in this film are mostly absolutely gorgeous. The plot very ably shows the hypocrisy of the female libido. When men are around they want to be pursued but when no men are around they become the pursuers of a 14 year old boy. And the boy becomes a man really fast (we should all be so lucky at this age!). He then gets up the courage to pursue his true love. 
 A wonderful free flowing often lyrical film that whisks you along ever smiling even if there are truly shocking incidents along the way. One gasps at the way the women are treated and yet ultimately they seem to come through very well and it is much credit to all concerned that so many potentially disastrous scenes all work so very well. This is possibly Depardieu's best performance certainly his most natural. Jeanne Moreau performs outstandingly in what must have been a very difficult role to play and including vigorous sex scenes with a couple of guys at least half her age. Miou-Miou is lovely throughout and again has very difficult scenes to play. Initially this seems a down and dirty misogynist rant/romp but as the tale and characters unfold a much more tender and honest picture emerges. In the end this uncompromising and daring film demands respect. 
 Im not a big Tim Matheson fan but i have to admit i liked this film.It was dark and a small bit disturbing with some scenes a bit edgy i don't know were to classify this film its a bit SF and a bit horror slash thriller.I saw this at about 2.00am or so on my local channel there was nothing else on so i decided to watch it.If you have not seen this film id recommend it its not really that bad the characters are interesting enough but not really explored to their full potential which could have made this film even more better.I don t know if this film went to the cinema but it felt like it was made for TV or went straight to video i for one would buy this if it s on DVD it fits well with my type of film and has a small bit of the X-FILES story attached to it.Government undertakings or shifty corporations involved in dodgy shadowy dealings.Overall a good film. 
 My grandmother bought me this film when I was 5 (I've always love scary movies) and even then I enjoyed it. The atmosphere is awesome and the story original and entertaining. I especially love the scenes where the RV is under attack in the desert. The rocks are actually convincing for such a low-budget flick. The acting is above average for these kinds of films and the music is eerie. This is definitely an uder-rated gem. I recommend it to anyone who likes these strange films from the late seventies early eighties such as Alice Sweet Alice Poor Pretty Eddie Nightmare Hospital Massacre and Return of the Aliens the Deadly Spawn . Definitely a classic!! 
 This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It has very good acting by Hanks Newman and everyone else. Definitely Jude Law's best performance. The cinematography is excellent the editing is about as good and includes a great original score that really fits in with the mood of the movie. The production design is also a factor in what makes this movie special. To me it takes a lot to beat Godfather but the fantastic cinematography displayed wins this contest. Definitely a Best Picture nominee in my book. 
 Not a bad film. Somehow I was made to actually root for the Iranians to win the game played in the movie even though I don't know anything about soccer and am not a fan. The ending on the bus was exhilarating. The film itself deals with the issue of women in Iran and how they are not allowed to go into sporting arenas amongst men because their swearing is inappropriate for women to hear. Despite this law some women try to sneak in but many of them get caught and detained. It's really astonishing that any society could still have such antiquated notions of gender. In an interview Panahi says his films are documents of history and its injustices and that one day in the future we can watch these movies and see how Iran once lived. One hopes that future will come sooner rather than later. 
 I saw this film a while back and it's still at the top of my 'favorite movies' list. It is amazingly put together and what really makes the film are the detailed tid bits (such as the 'Cafe Bustelo' coffee crate being reused as a cup to wash her grandsons hair) that people aren't seeing because YOU WILL NOT UNDERSTAND THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU ARE HISPANIC. This is just one of those films that is very culturally specific and particular. Please do not bash this film if you have no prior knowledge of what foundation it's being built upon. I completely see what the writer/director was going for and he hit the target perfectly! This film is highly deserving of a better rating. 
 This charmingly pleasant and tenderhearted sequel to the hugely successful The Legend of Boggy Creek is a follow-up in name only. Stories abound in a sleepy self-contained fishing community of a supposedly vicious Bigfoot creature called Big Bay Ty that resides deep in the uninviting swamplands of Boggy Creek. Two bratty brothers and their older more sensible tomboy sister (a sweetly feisty performance by cute pigtailed future Different Strokes sitcom star Dana Plato) go venturing into the treacherous marsh to check out if the creature of local legend may be in fact a real live being. The trio get hopelessly lost in a fierce storm and the furry bear-like humongous but very gentle and benevolent Sasquatch comes to the kids' rescue. Tom Moore's casual no-frills direction relates this simple story at a leisurely pace astutely capturing the workaday minutiae of the rural town in compellingly exact detail drawing the assorted country characters with great warmth and affection and thankfully developing the sentiment in an organic restrained unforced manner that never degenerates into sticky-sappy mush. The adorable Dawn Wells (Mary Ann on Gilligan's Island ) gives an engagingly plucky portrayal of the kids' loving working class single mom while Jim Wilson and John Hofeus offer enjoyably irascible support as a couple of squabbling ol' hayseed curmudgeonly coots. Robert Bethard's capable sunny cinematography displays the woodsy setting in all its sumptuously tranquil achingly pure and fragile untouched by civilization splendor. Darrell Deck's score adeptly blends flesh-crawling synthesizer shudders and jubilant banjo-pluckin' country bluegrass into a tuneful sonic brew. In addition this picture warrants special praise for the way it uncannily predicts the 90's kiddie feature Bigfoot vogue by a good 15-odd years in advance. 
 After a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted urban turn of the century Australian street we meet Julie (Rebecca Gibney) and Peter (John Adam) as they go out house hunting. They manage to get a loan for a fixer-upper on a posh Sydney street but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home. It just may be haunted. 13 Gantry Row combines a memorable if somewhat clich¨¦d story with good to average direction by Catherine Millar into a slightly above average shocker. The biggest flaws seem partially due to budget but not wholly excusable to that hurdle. A crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film. The opening thriller scene features some wonky editing. Freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that there's not much action. Suspense should be created from staging not fancy fix it in the mix techniques. There is great atmosphere in the scene from the location the lighting the fog and such but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street showing their increasing proximity. The tracking and the cuts need to be slow. The attack needed to be longer clearer and better blocked. As it stands the scene has a strong made for television feel and a low budget one at that. After this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves. The story has a lot of similarities to The Amityville Horror (1979) though the budget forces a much subtler approach. Millar and scriptwriter Tony Morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios often dramatic in nature instead of special effects-oriented such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wall. For some horror fans the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama. At least the first half hour of the film is primarily about Julie and Peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in. But Morphett writes fine intelligent dialogue. The material is done well enough that it's often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise later--especially if you've gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house. Once they get settled and things begin to get weirder even though the special effects often leave much to be desired the ideas are good. The performances help create tension. There isn't an abundance of death and destruction in the film--there's more of an abundance of home repair nightmares. But neither menace is really the point. The point is human relationships. There are a number of character arcs that are very interesting. The house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it. That it's in a posh neighborhood and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe such as money or health problems. Peter's character evolves from a striving corporate employee with normal work-based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful. At the same time we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be. Julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship. Although 13 Gantry Row never quite transcends its made-for-television clunkiness as a TV movie this is a pretty good one with admirable ambitions. Anyone fond of haunted house films psycho films or horror/thrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy. It certainly isn't worth spending $30 for a DVD (that was the price my local PBS station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it (factoring in shipping and handling)) but it's worth a rental and it's definitely worth watching for free. 
 This 1998 film was based on a script by the late Edward D. Wood a script that featured NO dialogue in the tradition of films such as THE THIEF. While much of Wood's work was quirky low-budget entries into various genre-film traditions his first released feature GLEN OR GLENDA was a truly visionary attempt to express the inexpressible through primitive avant-garde techniques. I WOKE UP EARLY THE DAY I DIED represents THAT side of Ed Wood the experimenter although this film is a comedy (a nightmarish comedy however!) while the cross-dressing theme of GLEN OR GLENDA was taken so seriously by Wood that there was not room for comedy there. From the first few seconds of this film I knew that I was being taken to a new cinematic world and I can't really compare that world with anything else. The technical side of the film--production design sound design music scoring photography etc.--is groundbreaking on any number of levels. In particular although the film has no dialogue there is sound of all kinds and also language but you'll have to see how it's done yourself as the cleverness and surprise of the methods provides a level of excitement throughout. The Glen or Glenda-esque technique of juxtaposing stock footage for surreal effects works well in the film and is kept to a minimum. The whole film is played at a hysterical fever-pitch and Billy Zane provides an amazing tour-de-force performance that shows what a brilliant physical comedian and actor he is. In a just world he would have been given some award for this performance. He even LOOKS like Ed Wood and as played by Zane this character is at various timesfunny sleazy tragic sympathetic and anonymous(sometimes simultaneously!!!). What a shame that this film was caught up in legal troubles and never received a North American theatrical or video release only playing a few festivals. Right now it's only available on video in Germany (in fact my copy is from a German source--the excerpts from Wood's screenplay that are shown on the screen from time to time are translated into german although the newspaper headlines (that great low-budget technique of giving plot elements especially those that would be too expensive to film via newspaper headlines is used here in the Wood tradition)that Zane sees are in English). I think that this film could have gotten a word-of-mouth following had it been played at midnight in some large cities with some careful promotion. And if played off city by city slowing on the art-film circuit it could have done well. In fact if the legal issues can be resolved I'd like to suggest that the film should STILL be given a theatrical release especially a MIDNIGHT cult release. This is a classic waiting to be discovered. Did I understand every scene? No but I felt every scene emotionally. Did everything work in the film? Perhaps not. I've only seen it twice and the first time I saw it I was interruped a number of times. However with all the assembly-line junk playing the multiplexes and with so much alternative film being fetishistic or pretentious shot-on-video film-school rejects we need actual Hollywood-made experimentation like this. The recent Bob Dylan film Masked and Anonymous took similar chances as did something like Steven Soderbergh's FULL FRONTAL. This film could find an audience much larger than either of those. If you are reading this review a few years from now and the idea of this film sounds intriguing see if it has ever been released on video. You will NOT be bored. Invite some friends over...make it a party. Play the amazing soundtrack LOUD. I have a feeling that wherever he is in the afterlife Ed Wood is happy with this film and feels as though his unique vision has been justified and validated somewhat by the making of this film. Wood's probably also laughing that just like he always seemed to get the bad breaks in life the film made in tribute to him after his death is held up in lawsuits and sits unreleased in the country of its making. 
 This is in my opinion much better than either of the 2 1990's versions but is still not all that good. It feels dated probably because it is but it does stand up well compared to other BBC 1980's period pieces such as Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. The length of this adaptation allows for a much better adaptation of the book than either of the 2 90's versions and St John Rivers is at least covered although not very well. Timothy Dalton is very good as Rochester but the actress playing Jane is much too old. There is definitely scope for a TV adaptation of this length that has more than a tenner spent on it. 
 ELEPHANT WALK may not be the acme of literature or of film but it is great entertainment in the quasi-melodramatic mode. It is the story of love both genuine and illicit as well as overweening ambition devotion and the arrogance of personal tyranny. A previous reviewer John Mankin questions why the central focus of the film the mansion called Elephant Walk should have been built by the former owner the governor the late Tom Wiley right across the elephants' traditional path to the major source of water the river. To miss this point is to essentially miss the point of the whole center of the film: the hubris of man. That his son played by Peter Finch should become enthralled by the super image and enigma of his revered father is not unexpected since the son was without a mother growing up in a foreign jungle with only his father and his father's rowdy 'boys' club' as his role models. The point of the father was that he was a self-made man who would tame nature to his liking and that liking was not just a tea plantation upon the lands the elephants once dominated but also that he would dominate even the large bull elephant that led the herd and thus he would dominate his son and all around him and so we join the tale after the elephants have been denied the crucial dry season access to their pathway to water. Who could know that this dry season would last so long and what the elephants would do in desperation to get water? This is the nexus of the film: what will animals do to get water; what will humans do to get power or love? Ceylon today's Sri Lanka is the huge island off the coast of India where the plantation is located and one quickly learns that it is the real scenery of the story not just the expenses of Miss Taylor. Were it not for this exotic location (much of the film was shot in Ceylon) and the magnificent bungalow this would have been just another potboiler. One must recognize the atmosphere created here as integral to the time and place as it illuminates the latter day wealth and power attained by the English immigrant 'conquerors' that were part and parcel of the British raj. It is only such wealth gained by the use of virtual slave labor that one could build so magnificent a residence of ebony teak and marble. Not to be overlooked are the wonderfully carved Jalees (grille work window and doorway borders) evidently specified by art directors J. McMillan Johnson and Hal Pereira and obviously made by the cheaper labor on the island. Such craftsmanship reveals the careful attention to detail that these men sought. For those immune to the blandishments of time place and architecture there is always the allure of Miss Taylor as she marries a man she doesn't really know and is tacitly wooed by a another man against the background described and under the overarching tyranny of the legacy of a man deceased. As I said it is not great literature nor even great film but it is great spectacle long before that term was debased by the special effects extravaganzas of today. This is one of those films made to be seen on the giant screen of an outdoor drive-in not on the home TV so arrange the largest screen to see it on to fully appreciate its fine camera-work and scope. 
 OK it's not a perfect movie by any means but I disagree with the overall IMDb opinion that it's really really bad. I watched a lot of Hong Kong flix in the 1990's and loved the era dearly. I never saw 'Black Mask' at the time and only saw it last week for the first time. Apart from the embarrassingly poor dubbing which my DVD copy didn't give me the option to turn off the movie contains the raw energy and bravado that permeated Hong Kong movies during this time. I still stick to my guns in the opinion that when it comes to action these guys no matter what their budget add an element of magic to the screen no Bourne Supremacy Casino Royale or Mission Impossible (I'm not knocking these movies - I just reckon they lack the spontaneity of this one and feel too regulated) will ever achieve. What is it? It's the feeling that the film-makers were experimenting as they shot and edited not afraid to leave in some blemishes so as to learn lessons for the next time. For me this makes watching movies all the more fun and dangerous. 
 I did not see this film in the theater. I confess to an anti-Vinnie Barbarino bias. Who the hell was John Travolta to be making movies? I remember the Oscar broadcast that year with Travolta looking absolutely devastated when he didn't win. How dare he when there were real actors in the running? I'm sorry John you should have won. After catching this film on cable years ago I fell in love with the entire movie. Bud Sissy Uncle Bob Wes all wonderfully done. I also confess to never passing it by when I channel surf. I HAVE to stop and watch. Over the years I've learned to do most of the dialogue dance with my thumbs in my waistband and learned to appreciate Travolta more. The only disappointing thing to me was the oversight on the soundtrack of some of the music from Urban Cowboy. Looking for love defines the film but Urban Cowboy was chock full of classics that DIDN'T make it to the soundtrack. It should have been a double CD........ 
 I watched this movie expecting what I got: good sci-fi cowboy stuff. What really surprised me was that Kurt Russell did such a great job with an extremely limited role. Imagine trying to act under these two restraints: you have hardly any dialogue and because you are playing a hardass military robot you are not allowed to show emotions using facial expressions! Howzat? Kinda like asking a diva to perform a great aria while gagged and duct-taped. In spite of being verbally and expressionally handcuffed Russell pulls off an incredible characterization. His robot becomes human in spite of the constraints. Great job! As usual Jason Isaacs insures that he will go down in history as a great portrayer of the consummate villain--the one you'd love to see drawn and quartered. Connie Nielsen was sweet soft motherly and gorgeous. I'm not sure how much of my impression is based on her acting and how much on her physical beauty but it was hard to take one's eyes off her. Unfortunately Gary Busey's role was too small and limited. Much of the plot is quite standard with a fair amount of weaknesses but as it does have a sci-fi comic book feeling I don't see what's wrong with a few weaknesses. By the end of the story the good guy wins and the appreciative audience receives a great deal of emotional satisfaction. Yes! The sort of feeb who thinks that Russell didn't do a good job of acting is the same sort of feeb who missed the whole point. 
 This movie is very good. The screenplay is enchanting. But Meryl Streep is most impressive. Her performance is excellent. She brings me to go into the heart of her role. 
 Lost is largely considered one of the most beautiful TV series that have never done ... and so is ... if you lovers of mysteries intrigue and adventure this is the series for you ...In the first season ... since the first episode starts to go increasingly to move forward until you get to the second season ... in the second you lose a little its cocktail of mystery and expectation and pushes very on and reveal the various mysteries that the island hides ... the third season is perhaps the second most beautiful because resumed suffered since the first episode with the pace and tenacity of the first season ... the fourth also not let pass unnoticed and tends to reveal a little mysteries ... but not as the second season but at a somewhat different ... For the fifth season expects ... 
 I voted this a 10 out of 10 simply because it is the best animated story I have been able to see in quite some time. The animation is stunning. The artwork behind each and every landscape was beautiful. From the colors to the lighting to the not standard fare of artistry. I was amazed. Moving beyond the beauty on the screen you are immersed in a storyline that is at once timeless and at the same turn fresh. Character development is brief yet these touchstone moments are exactly what is needed to clue the viewer in to what and why and how the character has come to where they stand. I'm impressed with the entire affair and think this is a must see for the entire family. 
 I just read the comments of TomReynolds2004 and feel I have to jump in here. I understand he doesn't like the film but his reasons are not evident. My feeling regarding this film is that it is not afraid to travel the darker roads of loneliness failure disappointment and sorrow. Each of these two people as portrayed have plenty of reasons to be bitter and angry yet find tenderness and comfort in each the other. Only great acting could make this work without becoming an emotional quagmire sentimental and sappy. I really became interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity given to them by such strong performances. I have every reason to dislike Jane Fonda for her Vietnam era actions but personal feelings apart she is fabulous in this role. Robert DeNiro is superb as a man whose intelligence and goodness begins to fail him in a world indifferent to his abilities. This is the first I have seen DeNiro using tenderness rather than toughness to sell a character and I really like it. This film was a big surprise when I first viewed it and I look forward to seeing it again. 
 Linking story: another first-time viewing for me and again this is one of the most popular of the Amicus anthologies - and it's easy to see why though I realize how the film's rather meaningless title could be misleading for some; I certainly fancied director Peter Duffell's choice - DEATH AND THE MAIDEN (which incidentally is a classical piece by Schubert that is heard in the film during the Peter Cushing episode) - a great deal more. Though the linking device itself is not all that great the episodes are all equally compelling and enjoyable. Production values come off as very respectable indeed for the budget Duffell had to work with. The latter infuses the film with a great deal of style which is not so common with this type of film and frankly it makes one regret the fact that he wished to distance himself from the genre (though more so as not to be typecast rather than because he felt it was beneath him). Now to the individual stories themselves: Method For Murder : the opening segment does not offer any real surprises but to make up for this it's quietly suspenseful and appropriately creepy at times (Tom Adams' 'fictitious' villain looking like the long-lost brother of Boris Karloff from THE OLD DARK HOUSE [1932]); also it ends with a satisfactory DIABOLIQUE-type twist and features a fairly intense role for Denholm Elliott in the lead. That's all we need out of it really. Waxworks : for the second story we are introduced to a curiously romantic mood which is quite unusual for this type of film; Peter Cushing and Joss Ackland are both excellent (as well as impeccably dressed) in their roles of two jilted lovers of a woman who continues to obsess them even after such a long time and whose friendly rivalry can only lead them blindly and inexorably to a fate that is literally worse than death; an ominous hallucination scene with Peter Cushing is quite well done in view of the limited resources at hand and Ackland's inexplicable inability - or unwillingness - to leave town somewhat recalls the house-trapped aristocrats of Bunuel's THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962). Sweets To The Sweet : this is perhaps the finest episode of all - with his ambiguous role here Christopher Lee continues to demonstrate his versatility and he is matched by an understanding Nyree Dawn Porter and the deceptive innocence of Chloe Franks (who appears as Lee's daughter). The film's treatment of the occult here is both subtle and mature culminating in a powerful and extremely chilling 'curtain'. Trivia Note: Chloe Franks appears as a grown-up in the featurette included on the disc and when I saw her I felt an immediate familiarity with her face but couldn't quite put my finger on it. Later on reading her filmography it was revealed to me that she had played one of the leads in the long-running stage adaptation of Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap in London's West End which my brother and I were fortunate enough to catch while we there on holiday in the Summer of 2002! Needless to say we had no idea then that she had once created such a delicate - and delicious - portrayal in sheer evil mainly by virtue of her peculiar look and a devilish smile!! The Cloak : a wacky but oddly reverent vampire tale (that still manages to debunk many of the myths attached to the subgenre while inventing some new ones!) which takes in some wonderful digs at exploitation cinema and at one point Christopher Lee himself!; Jon Pertwee is marvelous as the campy horror star who gets more than he bargained for when he attempts to bring a measure of authenticity to his work; Ingrid Pitt sends up her image nicely though her role is somewhat subsidiary to the proceedings; Geoffrey Bayldon (made up to look like Ernest Thesiger) also has a memorably quirky bit; the 'silent-cinema' style of the ending was a pretty audacious one to pull on an audience I suppose - and while some of the humor comes off as heavy-handed a' la THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS (1967) or THEATRE OF BLOOD (1973) it's also rather infectious and certainly ends the film on a high (and highly unusual) note! Video and audio quality are relatively satisfactory considering I had no other version to compare it with; the main culprit is some noticeable print damage but this is never so nasty as to affect one's enjoyment of the film. As for the extras beginning with the Audio Commentary: frankly this is one of the finest chats about a genre film that I can remember listening to; Jonathan Rigby gets to butt in with his opinion more than is usual for a moderator but his effort certainly allows director Peter Duffell to touch on every aspect of the production (whereas with some other films you're left rather expecting there to be more!) and as such it's an extremely pleasant track that complements the main feature very nicely indeed. The featurette A-Rated Horror Film is a worthwhile effort with Peter Duffell again at center-stage but this time backed up with valid if all-too-brief contributions from producer Max J. Rosenberg and stars Chloe Franks Ingrid Pitt and Geoffrey Bayldon. We also get film notes reviews bios and a poster/stills gallery which again are wonderfully assembled (with the contemporary reviews being something of a novelty - and a welcome one at that). 
 This is the movie I've seen more times than any other (I believe I saw it on average once every year since it was released). And every time I see it it is equally fantastic and always reveals something new to me. The cast was most probably a combination of the very best there ever was in ex Yu cinematography. This movie is an absolute must for any self respecting movie lover. In the same league: Maratonci trce pocasni krug Balkanski spijun and Otac na sluzbenom putu. This is a poker of movies everyone should have in his private video collection. 
 After watching this film last night on Sundance I realized that much of Nakata's style was first done in this film. Here we have many of the same elements of the RINGU series especially the idea of the media being the source of the supernatural. Instead of the cursed videotape we instead having a haunted studio and strange images appearing on film. In fact the strange images appearing on film brings immediately the cursed videotape in RINGU to mind. The only thing missing was the obsession to water that runs through Nakata's later films. The final scenes are quite chilling with a bit of a nod to Murnau what with the door opening by itself ands the ghost entering the room reminds me immediatly of NOSFERATU. A chilling movie that will make think twice about going up to a catwalk. 
 I was about 11 years old i found out i live 0.48 miles from the uncle house. the uncle house is on Westway Dr deer park TX. they have added homes since the movie was made. i don't know the house number but you can go look it up. i am now 21 and i enjoy watching this movie. the bar on Spencer is no longer their. Pasadena ISD wants to build a school their. I drove by the house last week the house still looks great. My dad and uncle would go to the street where the house is and watch the actors come in and out of the house trying to make the movie. where john cross over the railroad cracks they have made 225 higher. when i hear about john loesing his son i start thinking about when he made urban cowboy he was 26 or 25 at the time. 
 Haven't seen any of the Japanese Grudge-films but I really enjoy this one. I rarely get SCARED when watching films. I can jump if the effect and sound is startling enough but getting scared from a movie is a rare thing for me. But I did get scared from Grudge. Maybe because I didn't expect anything at all when I watched it. I didn't expect getting scared. I didn't know anything about it either. That was probably a good thing. This is a film that you apparently either love or hate. Most people seem to compare it to the Japanese Grudge-films but even though I haven't seen them I believe it isn't right to compare any film actually. This film stands on it its own. The story is weak most people say. I don't agree. The story is minimalistic and done so on purpose. The story-telling techniques used - the broken time frame for instance - is perfectly done. The director knows exactly what he's doing and I believe he got his vision through as he wanted it. I gave this film 8 of 10. It is a film you will enjoy watching or hate. It's as simple as that. 
 Presenting Lily Mars is a real pleasant little film which showcases the comedy skills of actress Judy Garland along with her standard singing moments. The plot consists of Lily Mars tagging along after producer John Thornway for her big break. I think the comedy is light and nothing too heavy here. I really recommend this film for everyone. Judy is breathtaking in this role! 
 I rate this 10 out of 10. Why? * It offers insight into something I barely understand - the surfers surf because it's all they want to do; Nothing else seems to matter as much to them as surfing; Nor is it a temporary thing - it's a lifetime for these guys * Buried in the movie is a great history of surfing; I have never surfed but I love surfing movies and have seen many. None taught me what this movie did * The movie was very well edited. It flowed well. The interviews were outstanding * It's interesting from start to finish In summary it's about as good as a documentary as I have seen so I have to rate in terms of that. So 10/10 
 Apparently Ruggero Deodato figured out early on that his story wouldn't work if he approached it too seriously so he decided to camp it up. The result is a film that can be viewed as either a ludicrous sword-and-sorcery epic or as a very entertaining comedy! And I think I'll go the second way. The brief gore moments are well-done the Paul Brothers openly mock the material (they even bark at each other in one scene!) and there is also a charming spirited good-natured performance by Eva La Rue as the girl who tags along with the boys . Plus where else can you see the insides of a dragon lighted like a discotheque?? (***) 
 In the trivia section for Pet Sematary it mentions that George Romero (director of two Stephen King stories Creepshow and The Dark Half) was set to direct and then pulled out. One wonders what he would've brought to the film as the director Mary Lambert while not really a bad director doesn't really bring that much imagination to this adaptation of King's novel of which he wrote the screenplay. There are of course some very effective grotesquely surreal scenes (mainly involving the sister Zelda likely more of a creep-out for kids if they see the film) and the casting in some of the roles is dead-perfect. But something feels missing at times some sort of style that could correspond with the unmistakably King-like atmosphere which is in this case about as morbid as you're going to get without incestuous cannibals rising from the graves being thrown in (who knows if he'll save that for his final novel...) As mentioned though some of the casting is terrific notably Miko Hughes as Gage Creed the little boy who goes from being one of the cutest little kids this side of an 80's horror movie to being a little monster (I say that as a compliment of course especially in scenes brandishing a certain scalpel). And there is also a juicy supporting role for Fred Gwynne of the Munsters who plays this old secretive man with the right notes of under-playing and doom in tone. And applause goes to whomever did the make-up on Andrew Hubatsek. But there are some other flaws though in the other casting; Dale Midkiff is good not great as the conflicted disturbed father figure Creed and his daughter Ellie is played by an actress that just didn't work for me at all. In terms of setting up some chilling set-pieces only a couple really stand-out: a certain plot-thickening moment (not to spoil it does involve a cool Ramones song) and the first visit to the pet sematary (the bigger one) including the sort of mystical overtones King had in the Shining. For the most part it's a very polished directing job though it could've been made even darker to correspond with the script. If thought out in logical terms (albeit in King terms) it is really one of his more effective works of the period. But it doesn't add up like it could or should. Still it makes for a nifty little midnight movie. 
 This is a very very early Bugs Bunny cartoon. As a result the character is still in a transition period--he is not drawn as elongated as he later was and his voice isn't quite right. In addition the chemistry between Elmer and Bugs is a little unusual. Elmer is some poor sap who buys Bugs from a pet shop--there is no gun or desire on his part to blast the bunny to smithereens! However despite this this is still a very enjoyable film. The early Bugs was definitely more sassy and cruel than his later incarnations. In later films he messed with Elmer Yosimite Sam and others because they started it--they messed with the rabbit. But in this film he is much more like Daffy Duck of the late 30s and early 40s--a jerk who just loves irritating others!! A true anarchist instead of the hero of the later cartoons. While this isn't among the best Bug Bunny cartoons it sure is fun to watch and it's interesting to see just how much he's changed over the years. 
 This is the kind of movie England can do in its sleep and that's meaning it as a compliment. Because of the success of very British comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the Twentieth Century most notably adaptations of E. M. Forster novels this very Merchant-Ivory like production was received in the light it brought when it was released in 1992. It was an exceptional year for actress Miranda Richardson having appeared as the wife of Jeremy Irons who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in DAMAGE and as the IRA terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in THE CRYING GAME. Here she plays a quiet serene type of woman in Rose Arbuthnot one who with Josie Lawrence who plays Lottie Wilkins embarks on a trip that is filled with self-discovery. They are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies: one Caroline Dester played by the enigmatic Polly Walker who resembles a very vamp Louise Brooks (and not just in the style of hair she wears) and Mrs. Fisher (Joan Plowright). This foursome will eventually merge together into becoming deep friends only because the story is so filled with spring and an overwhelming dreamy sweetness it almost preordains it but this is fine; it's the movie it wants to be. Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent (then relatively new to American audiences) fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters and all in all Mike Newell makes with his movie a living thing of near-magical elements full of quiet moments and wonder. 
 Man some of you people have got to chill. This movie was artistic genius. Instead of searching for reasoning or messages to justify it in your reality why can't you understand that it is a work of fiction? A story. Entertainment for God's sake (no pun intended). It seems to me that too many of the people on here are trying to be movie critics--and they're not doing to well. I'm so impressed by the movie and Bill Paxton's job at directing that I'm going to contact him personally to tell him. Ya know if you weren't trying to analyze the heck out of the possibility of the story line you might just enjoy the film. Me and all of my friends did! 
 Babyface - Notorious Barbara Stanwyck flick where she is told by the local professor type that she has power- he tries to get her to read Nietzche- she says books ain't never done her no good.Soon we find out her father is basically pimping her out to a local politico and others.Finally she has had enough and relocates to the big city.We follow her trail of men up the ladder of success in an international bank.The dialogue is quite saucy for it's time and it was one the last films to come out before the self inflicted Hollywood production code.Look for a cameo by a young John Wayne as one of Stanwyck's willing victims.Part of the Forbidden Hollywood collection - I watched the extended version- the DVD has both versions plus Red-Headed Woman and Waterloo Bridge.An interesting movie and foreshadowing for future femme fatale roles that Stanwyck would play in the era of film noir. B+ 
 From what I've read a lot of people were disappointed by this film compared to Part 1. Initially I could understand this but after a bit of thought I think they are wrong to be. Soderbergh continues his fact based telling of Che's life that he started in Part 1. Part 1 told a story of a revolution moving from unpromising beginnings to an ultimately successful conclusion. Part 2 tells a story of a revolution that moves from unpromising beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion. It is not Soderbergh's fault that these 2 parts of Che's life had completely different outcomes. He bravely chooses to tell both in a fairly straightforward way. The viewer may feel a lot better coming out of the cinema after Part 1 than Part 2 but that is the reality of Che's life and not in my opinion any fault of the director. The film is far from perfect. It is probably too long. At least in Part 1 we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrillas had successes. In Part 2 they can't catch a break and we see their numbers constantly being reduced by death and capture. Che's capture and death are dealt with well. The film is greatly enhanced by the dialogue being in Spanish. Benicio Del Toro is again excellent as the charismatic Argentinian. So if you've seen Part 1 you will see a very similar telling of a very different story in Part 2. 
 It's true that you always remember what you were doing at a point when disaster or tragedy strikes. And none more so that September 11 2001 a date which changed the entire global landscape in its fight against terrorism. No this documentary didn't set out to be dwelling on the events leading to 9/11. Rather the filmmakers brothers G¨¦d¨¦on and Jules Naudet set out to do a documentary on the trials and tribulations of a rookie New York firefighter. They had gone to the academy and done some shoots of training and had handpicked their proby (probation firefighter) to join them in an NY firehouse home to Ladder 1 and Engine 7. But their production was to develop and contain at that time believed to be the only shot of the first plane slamming into the World Trace Center. I was traveling back with a friend on the train from a night of LAN gaming and received a call at about 850pm local time from my Dad who informed me of the above. Few minutes later he told me there was another and that the WTC was under attack. By the time I arrived home the upper floors of the twin towers were ablaze and in smoke and to my horror they collapsed under an hour. The filmmakers had two cameras running that day one who had followed a team out on a routine call and which immediately raced to the WTC upon hearing and seeing the plane crash into it. We follow what is possible the only filmed sequence of events in the lobby of WTC1 where the first responders of firefighters paramedics and police had to make sense of what happened and to quickly develop a plan of action. The other camera held by the other brother was making his way to WTC to look for his sibling and along the journey captured the many expressions of New Yorkers as well as the sense of chaos in and around Manhatten. Peppered throughout the documentary are numerous interviews with the men from Ladder 1 and Engine 7 which miraculously did not suffer any casualty. But being survivors also brought about its own set of psychological turmoil as they struggle to come to terms with the event. Through the events that unfold we learn of the strong camaraderie amongst these men who risk live and limb each day on their jobs to save lives. We began with what the documentary was supposed to be before events of the day totally swung in and became the focus right up to the rescue phase where hopes of finding survivors under the rubble were kept alive by the men who work round the clock in making sense of the collapsed steel structures. It's not a film that is fabricated and what you see here cannot be recreated in any other documentary (and heavens not sound stages for Hollywood blockbusters). It's as close as you can get to that day witnessing the event up close from safety. Code 1 DVD contains a separate extra hour of 4 sets of interviews with the men of Ladder 1 and Engine 7. 
 I love this film 'Spring and port wine'. I was born in Leigh a town about 7 miles away from Bolton I moved to Bolton in 1965 when I was 20. My place of work was daily via Little Lever through Farnworth sometimes on a bike but then by car when I could afford it.The film brings back all the memories of the working class neighbors who were almost always broke but who would always help you if they could. Fred Dibnah was round the corner from Bromwich St. were my bedsit was. If you didn't see the film when first released then you may be forgiven for comparing it to a soap such as Coronation St well I agree it is a soap but then it was called 'Kitchen Sink Drama!' Watch this film for the talented cast who shortly afterwards became household names from frequent roles on TV I watch mainly for the shots of the locality and the feel good factor of people being poor but happy! 
 Otto Preminger's noir classic works almost as a flip-side of LAURA...while that film was glitzy and features the high fa-luting Clifton Webb this film is a whole lot seamier. Dana Andrews is a less than good cop who accidentally kills a man only to have it potentially pinned on the father of the girl he loves. Preminger keeps things moving at a brisk clip so that lapses in logic are easily overlooked. Andrews is quite fine (a lot less wooden than he's been in the past) and the stunningly beautiful Gene Tierney is stunningly beautiful! Creepy Craig Stevens plays the unlucky victim. WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS is a must see and a terrific companion-piece to Preminger's equally lurid WHIRLPOOL (also starring Tierney). 
 I have waited a long time for someone to film a faithful version of H.G. Wells' classic novel War Of The Worlds . Timothy Hines has finally done it! I just couldn't believe how good it was! From the acting to the costuming the out-of-this world special effects I just can't say enough!It was wonderful! Dramatic intense full of first-rate performances by a top-notch cast! It's got to be seen to be believed. I sure didn't. And I've read all those negative comments by the others and can't believe what they were saying. We must've been watching a different movie huh? And those real bad comments by that vepsaian guy guy whoever he is well he just doesn't know what he's talking about. Keep up the good work mr. Hines. 
 Hello. This movie is.......well.......okay. Just kidding! ITS AWESOME! It's NOT a Block Buster smash hit. It's not meant to be. But its a big hit in my world. And my sisters. We are rockin' Rollers. GO RAMONES!!!! This is a great movie.............. For ME! 
 Religious bigotry is rampant everywhere. Australia is not immune to it. A dingo snatched a baby and the mother was tried and sent to prison for having killed her own baby. I don't mean to spoil the story for you but you need to know the basics before getting knee-deep in what caused this woman to find herself inside a prison. Buy or rent the movie and discover how deep-seated human hatred of those who are different continues to thrive around the globe. This is a very moving motion picture with a terrific cast of actors. Both Meryl Streep (with her famous Aussie accent) and Sam Neill whose accent is his native-born pronunciation are outstanding. Those with supporting roles are also quite good. You will remember this movie for many years. See it! 
 I love MIDNIGHT COWBOY and have it in my video collection as it is a favorite of mine. What is interesting to me is how when MIDNIGHT COWBOY came out in 1969 it was so shocking to viewers that it was rated X. Of course at that time X meant Maturity. Since I was only two years old at the time of the movie's release it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then. However when I try to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film which included prostitution (the title itself was slang for a male prostitute); homosexuality; loneliness; physical (and to some extent emotional as well) abuse and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this day I can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought back on its release. It is worth noting that in the 1970's MIDNIGHT COWBOY was downgraded to an R rating and even though it is still rated R some of the scenes could almost be rated PG-13 by today's standards. I want to briefly give a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie. Jon Voight plays a young man named Joe Buck from Texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in New York City escorting rich women. He emulates cowboy actors like Roy Rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women. After being rejected by all the women he has come across he meets a sleazy con-man named Enrico Ratso Rizzo who is played by Dustin Hoffman. Ratso convinces Joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager. Once again Joe is conned and before long is homeless. However Joe comes across Ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment. Without giving away much more of the plot I want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with Joe and Ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams. I.E. Joe making it as a gigolo and Ratso going down to Florida where he thinks he can regain his health. I want to make some comments about the movie itself. First of all the acting is excellent especially the leads. Although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end there are some classic scenes. In fact there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny I find them amusing. For example there is the classic scene where Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over. Dustin Hoffman bangs on the cab and says Hey I'm walkin' here! I'm walkin' here! I get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of New York City where so many people are in a hurry. Another scene that comes to mind is the scene where Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) sends Joe (Jon Voight) to a guy named O'Daniel. What is amusing is that at first we think O'Daniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why Joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that O'Daniel is nothing but a religious nut. In addition to the two scenes I mentioned I love the scene where Ratso and Joe are arguing in their apartment when Ratso says to Joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and Joe says in self-defense John Wayne! You gonna tell me he's a fag! What I like is the delivery in that scene. I would say that even though MIDNIGHT COWBOY was set in the late '60's much of it rings true today. That's because although the area around 42nd Street in New York has been cleaned up in the form of Disneyfication in the last several years homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was 40 years ago. Also many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams smashed as was the case with the Jon Voight character. One thing that impresses me about Jon Voight's character is how he is a survivor and I felt that at the end of the movie he had matured a great deal and that Ratso (Dustin Hoffman's character) was a good influence on him. In conclusion I want to say that I suggest that when watching this movie one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on. For example there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings. Also what I find interesting is that there is a lot in this movie that is left to interpretation such as what really happened with Joe Buck (Jon Voight's character) and the people who were in his life in Texas. Even the ending while I don't want to give it away for those who have not seen the movie is rather open-ended. 
 A wonderful film version of the best-selling book and smash Broadway play about the lives of Sadie and Bessie Delany two African-American sisters who both lived over the age of 100 and told their story of witnessing a century of American history. Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll give very good performances as Bessie and Sadie respectively. Amy Madigan also is good as Amy Hill Hearth the white New York Times reporter whose article about the sisters launched the book etc. Many of the flashback scenes and even many of the present-day ones are very powerful if not quite as inspirational as in the book. That is the only real drawback combined with the fact that certain aspects of the story are not presented clearly such as the inter-racial background of the sisters' mother and why their father was so stern. But other than that a very well-done excellently performed powerful movie. 
 A fascinating look at the relationship of a single father in 1998 and a single mother in 1881 tied together by a time-traveling teenager. Reminded me of Somewhere In Time Richard Matheson's Bid Time Return as rendered by Christopher Reeves and Jane Seymour. 
 Young Erendira and her tyrranical Grandmother provide for a great fantasy from the new world. This interpretation of Gabriel Garcia Marquez' La incr¨¦ible y triste historia da la c¨¢ndida Er¨¦ndira ... may not rub Marquez purists the right way eventhough The story stays intact and still carries the full force of the work. The strength of this film is in its acting especially Papas as the Grandmother. Marquez fans and Marquez novices alike will enjoy this movie for its real gritty brand of witt. 
 Sarafina was a fun movie and some of the songs were really great. Sarafina was very entertaining. I don't normally like music things like this but the singing was not lame like it looked like on the box. The movie was useful for learning about history because it was an interesting perspective of the Soweto rioting of 1976. It showed you things from the perspective of the students in the rioting and showed you that they were real characters. Because you got to see them as real characters this makes you like them more as an audience and makes you more sympathetic to them as totally the victims of the white government who you can not sympathise with. The singing of the students is correct because we know from accounts that the students in the riot were singing and dancing before it became violent. The clothing of the students in Sarafina is very similar to the clothing shown in photos from Soweto. They made the movie actually in Soweto which is why it looks very accurate in many parts. All these things make the film more accurate for someone using it to learn about aparthied. As viewers we must be critical of the way the history of Apartheid was presented. As I said before you become sympathetic to the students - this makes it potentially less reliable and objective. Also it changes some of the details from other accounts. In Sarafina it turns to chaos when the policeman comes into their classroom and shoots the students. The police and army were very aggressive at Soweto but this is probably an exaggerated event. The police and army did shoot students but there is not evidence of them going into schools and executing people like this. The fighting was more in the streets and had looting and crime. This is done in the movie probably to make you feel more sorry for the school students. The movie would have been more useful if it had some different information about aparthied. The teacher was arrested for being against the government and the mum goes to work in a white persons house. But there is not any information about the government and why they were doing it or any details about the racist policies and laws. -By George S Chris and Finlay 
 Anton Newcombe makes the film and he is the main subject. Watching him knock up a song if not a whole album quickly showed the guy to be a real talent. He thinks he is god but is so prollific and interesting. The DW are not really that interesting in comparison musicly or otherwise. Hey do you haver a drivers license? Anton says to the cameraman Well lets go pawn this guitar! . Great use of archive/ home video material. Great to see rock docs still being made. A cool doc about the creative process. If you like this go see Nirvana Live! Tonight! Sold Out! on DVD. A good experience Anton is this film. 8 out of 10 
 I'm no fan of newer movies but this one was a real pleasure to watch. Adults and children could watch it together - how unusual! My aunt liked it too. It had laughter tears love adventure special effects good actors - and a talking parrot. It reminded me of a favourite The Wizard of Oz. The hero Paulie an intelligent parrot is separated from his home and family and goes through many adventures temptations and disappointments always keeping in mind his resolution to find his friend Marie. Highly recommended. 
 October Sky is a highly lauded movie and it?|s easy to see why. The story is easy to comprehend and many turning points are gripping the actors and actresses do fairly good jobs especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper the hero finally gets what he wants and it?|s a true story. Frankly I think the director?|s achievement is not comparable to the sparks and heat the original story generates. We don?|t see any special narrative or cinematography; the power of the movie relies much on the riveting plot and tough situation the young hero is trapped in that most audience will find themselves identify with the characters. We feel Homer?|s desire to earn his father?|s recognition and create his own future and his resilience wins our respect. ?¡ìOctober Sky?¡§ reminds me of a later 2001 Japanese production of mini series ?¡ìRocket Boy ?¡§ which might owe some of the inspiration from this movie. Actually these two works shot from two different cultures provide interesting comparison. When October Sky unfolds a story of a young man crying out loud to claim his right over his own destiny ?¡ìRocket Boy?¡§ offers a more compromised description that could sometimes constitute an acrid criticism of modern society. Starring the outstanding actor Yuji Oda ?¡ìRocket Boy?¡§ focuses on three men as ordinary as can be: a travel agent who has a dream of becoming an astronaut a boastful advertising agent who is on the brink of being torn apart by his inferiority complex resulted from the extreme success of his father and older brother (like what Homer feels in his family) and a food company employee who is about to getting married but scared of this idea. The collected social consciousness superimposes its definition of success on its constituents and steps further to force them suffocate their dreams by claiming them ?¡ìimpossible.?¡§ To compensate for his lost ideal Kobayashi (Yuji) works in the tour operator because it?|s called ?¡ìGalaxy.?¡§ When his client fails him and his girlfriend decides to leave him he finally finds strength from his father?|s words who had determined to be a sailor but later found life on the sea less attractive as he had presumed. ?¡ìBut I don?|t regret it ?¡§ his father told Kobayashi ?¡ìat least I tried.?¡§ It is his father?|s confession that encourages him to resign his job and apply for astronautships despite the fact that he hurts his legs and needs to move around on a wheelchair. Kobayashi?|s effort finally fails and he goes back to the travel agency. But his ?¡ìcrazy?¡§ courage inspires his friends and everyone loves him more. Just before the end of the series Kobayashi is on the job as a guide of a space camp meant to let children learn more about astronauts. After the tour is over we see him leaning against a tree unfolding a sheet of poster he tears from the bulletin board that says: ?¡ìAstronauts Wanted for 2004.?¡§ Kobayashi looks at the piece of paper and laughs and laughs just like a kid looking at his ticket to Disneyland. Kobayashi may never get what he wants but he dares his destiny and ?¡ìjust does it.?¡§ This series is so heart-gripping not because the hero exhibits any heroic deeds but his ordinariness and unstoppable urge to realize his dream which make us wonder and envy. Unlike Dilbert or other sarcastic writings this show enlightens us and teaches us something. Homer and Kobayashi both have the dream and they do what they can despite other people?|s opinions. I recommend other IMDB users to see the Japanese TV series. If you are a nine-to-fiver you will feel more touched. I feel sorry that IMDB doesn?|t have its data maybe you can ask somebody from Japan to help you. 
 In the funeral of the famous British journalist Joe Strombel (Ian McShane) his colleagues and friends recall how obstinate he was while seeking for a scoop. Meanwhile the deceased Joe discloses the identity of the tarot card serial killer of London. He cheats the Reaper and appears to the American student of journalism Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) who is on the stage in the middle of a magic show of the magician Sidney Waterman (Woody Allen) in London and tells her that the murderer is the aristocrat Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). Sondra drags Sid in her investigation seeking for evidences that Peter is the killer. However she falls in love with him and questions if Joe Strombel is right in his scoop. Scoop is another great Woody Allen's comedy outside Manhattan actually again in London. His ironic and witty lines are simply fantastic and I laughed a lot inclusive with his fate of hero in a country where people drive in the wrong side . Sid Waterman is extremely funny and Woody Allen is in an excellent shape as comedian. However his present muse Scarlett Johansson of whom I am a big fan has over-acting and is annoying in many moments changing inclusive her accent to a histrionic pronunciation. Her character is absolutely silly and promiscuous and I was quite disappointed with her performance (probably for the first time in her filmography). But this supernatural comedy is still a hilarious and worthwhile entertainment. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): Scoop ? O Grande Furo ( Scoop ? The Big Scoop ) 
 Eddie Murphy Delirious is by far the funniest thing you will ever see in your life. You can compare it to any movie and I garuntee you will decide that Delirious is the funniest movie ever! This movie is about 1hr. 45 mins. and throughout that time there was barely a moment where I wasn't laughing. You will laugh for hours after it is over replaying the punch lines over and over and over in your head. Eddie Murphy has given so many funny performances over his career (48 Hrs. Trading Places Beverly Hills Cop Raw Coming To America The Nutty professor Shrek etc.) but this is by far his MOST HILARIOUS moment. I have seen this movie so many times and it is funnier every time. It never loses its edge. From this day forward every great stand up performance will be emulated from Delirious. ***** and two thumbs up! 
 You'd think you're in for some serious sightseeing when the premise of the movie takes place primarily between two characters as they travel 3000 miles or so from France to Saudi Arabia going through most of Europe - Italy Bulgaria Croatia Slovenia Turkey before arriving in the Middle East. But this is not a tour and there are no stopovers for soaking in the sights. Reda's father is in his twilight years and wishes to do the Haj. However since walking and taking the mule is out of the question he chooses to travel to Mecca by car. He can't drive and therefore enlists the help of Reda to his son's protest to get him there in their broken down vehicle. But Reda doesn't see the point of having him go along when his dad could opt for the plane. He resents the idea of having put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he couldn't understand. And hence we set off in this arduous journey with father and son being not the best of pals. The beauty of this movie is to witness the development of the father and son pair the challenges they face the weird people they meet having to duke it out in varied weather conditions and alternating rest stops between motels and sleeping in the car. We see an obvious generation gap in them trying to communicate to each other the father trying to impose on his son and the son trying to assert himself as an adult but circumstances we see reveal that Reda is quite a fish out of water. Through the many encounters they actually team up quite well despite their differences. It's perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to coincide with Hari Raya Haji and having the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their Haj. The final scene in Mecca is truly a sight to behold and you too would feel the claustrophobia and fear as Reda tries to hunt down his dad amongst the thousands of people congregating. The sights of Europe were perhaps deliberately not dwelled upon so as to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destination. It certainly rang home the thought of telling and showing loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are. Don't miss this and yes book early - I was pleasantly surprised that this evening's session was still a full house. 
 Classic highly influential low budget thriller that gave birth to a horror icon and launched the careers of both director Carpenter and star Curtis. Seemingly unstoppable murderer escapes from mental institution and returns to his hometown where he begins to stalk a local babysitter on Halloween. Halloween is a film that never fails to live up to its reputation as a horror masterpiece! Carpenter's frightening story and clever direction give this film such chillingly good life that it must be seen to really be felt! The direction often consists of such simple elements shadows dark streets creaking doors that it makes even the everyday setting of a small town neighborhood truly creepy. Carpenter well-times his suspense and his jolting shocks to make them the most effectively startling that in itself is a feat few horror filmmakers ever manage! Plus he is wise enough to give us some truly likable young characters and a very scary villain to keep the tension all the more strong. Highest kudos also go to Carpenter's simple yet frighteningly unnerving music score. In a sense Halloween is a fine example of a perfect horror film! The cast is excellent. Young Jamie Lee Curtis does a very nice turn as lovable babysitter Laurie Strode she's so good that she would go on to be in a number of other horror films before breaking into bigger films. The great Donald Pleasants does a perfect performance as a Myer's doctor who's desperate to capture him again. Supporting cast Loomis Soles Castle and others are good too. So like its own villain Halloween is an unstoppable force that never fails to thrill and chill. It is a MUST for all genre fans! **** out of **** 
 I liked this movies. Its a another Yash raj film which you know will look good on screen all character are always nice or very nice with one exception who you know will eventually covert to being nice... Another rule of Yash raj's film is that either hero or heroine;s have only one or none parent. Think back to all of those films.. MPK Suman didn't have mom HMAPK Salman didn't have parents AND FINAL rule is that you are 90% likely to see Alock Nath crying... The film is good too. Its a bit slow at first but keeps you entertained. There is almost no comedy but it does make you smile often enough. The little kid (hero's nephew) is well placed and deliver very good one liners. The actress is very pretty but shy you wouldn't get that in real life. this film doesn't have massively big happy families living in BIG house which I thou was a good Idea and allowed the film to be differentiated from other films. There will be lots of women crying at the end of the film. There isn't a strong message from this film but its a good watch. If you are married (arranged marriage)the film will remind you of what you went through. And if you are not it will inform and may be scare you ... Overall a very good looking film. No big plots or twists but a very gentle film very much like Bollywood classic. 
 i'm gonna give it to ya straight...this movie is amazing. foreign gay films are so fast surpassing American gay films in production quality acting and story. while so many American indie gay films are grainy bad sound amateur acting trite story lines and a surprising lack of any nudity or erotica top-quality foreign gay films have been popping up like this one from France. the cinematography is beautiful thought out meaningful. the story is adult and complex (but not difficult for anyone to follow) the acting is intense and professional. both leads are fantastic as well as the entire cast. the boys are more than just good-looking and there's plenty of full frontal nudity. you follow the entire year of these boys from their meeting to the end. all the little nuances of a relationship's the details of falling in and out of love are there beautifully performed. it left me wanting more. check it out! 
 B Movie? Yes. DIY? Yes. First Movie? Yes. But Aestheically A+. This movie definitely had some bad sound/editing/lighting/acting/etc. etc. problems. However this movie has many positive things about it. First off the most annoying character dies first! Second its made to be a parody/funny B Rated Horror movie. The comments our killer makes to his victims left me and my friends rolling around on the floor laughing. The problem is a lot of people try to take every independent movie and expect it to be a masterpiece. Take it for what it is a bunch of kids right out of high school made their first movie. For what it is just that it is really good. 
 'Had Ned Kelly been born later he probably would have won a Victoria Cross at Gallipolli'. such was Ned's Bravery. In Australia and especially country Victoria the name Ned Kelly can be said and immediately recognised. In Greta he is still a Hero the life Blood of the Town of Jerilderie depends on the tourism he created but in Mansfield they still haven't forgotten that the three policeman that he 'murdered' were from there. Many of the buildings he visited in his life are still standing. From the Old Melbourne Gaol where he was hanged to the Post office he held up in Jerilderie. A cell he was once held in in Greta is on display in Benella and the site of Ann Jones' Hotel the station and even the logs where he was captured in Glenrowan can be visited. Evidence of all the events in the movie (except for his love interest) can be found all over Victoria in police records and even in the Sash that Ned was awarded with for rescuing Dick Shelton from drowning. None of this is wrong and whats left out would further justify Neds actions. The Horse that Ned 'stole' was actually stolen by Wild Wright (the man who Ned boxes with after getting out of jail). Ned was already in prison when the horse was reported stolen so he couldn't have stolen it. The Jerilderie Letter is more than what has been stated before. It is not self justification it is Ned's biography an outline of what he stood for and who he was protecting. So go ahead and read it watch the movie and then make up your mind about what Ned stood for. 
 Really touching story of a recruitment camp in America where young men are prepared for the Vietnam war. The human study always appealed to me when it comes to war movies because it translates personal subjective opinions on war opposed war action movies where action and technical data are being analyzed to the prejudice of the human factor. The movie manages to put a new spin on an already ancient subject and manages to distance itself from usual war movies especially by focusing on an anti-hero from the view-point of traditional standard. The movie focuses on the tragic character of Bozz who smartly avoids being sucked in by the dehumanizing war machine and refuses to give up control over his destiny and fight for something he doesn't believe in spends his energy in searching ways to avoid being sent overseas both for himself and comrades and ironically ends up finding his own just reason for finally going to war. Perfect irony. The acting is truly exceptional and the documentary-style shooting almost makes you feel transposed into the movie. Also the movie will provide food for thought for those exhilarated by the action in usual war movies or war-games enthusiasts hopefully awakening some minds of a generation which luckily escaped the terror of being drafted.
